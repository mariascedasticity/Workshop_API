# Workshop on API, unstructured data and basic NLP

The main hurdle for empirical researchers to overcome is to find suitable data, that can be efficiently collected. Thanks to a large list of public APIs (https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis), this uphill battle is not that `uphill` anymore. I'd be happy to share my practical experience with students of the Master's programme focused on business analytics.

The workshop aims to provide students with a concise introduction to getting Open Data for any data analysis project using Python. In particular, I designed it in a way, that students will learn a little bit about news media and invited them to the world of persuasion, manipulation, biases, and one-sided communication. The world of verbal and nonverbal information, where both texts and images, and information between the lines metter. The world which one day can help you in business analysis tasks.
