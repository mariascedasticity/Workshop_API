For thousands of years, farmers have selectively bred livestock to champion superior traits such as disease resistance and heat tolerance, but techniques such as artificial insemination are often limited by technical and logistical challenges. But by using the gene-editing tool Crispr-Cas9 – often likened to a pair of molecular scissors – to remove a gene that is specific to male sterility, the hope is farmers can use a more efficient approach to address the growing challenges of global food insecurity, climate change, and endangered species. The scientists created sterile, but otherwise healthy mice, pigs, goats and cattle. The animals were then transplanted with sperm-producing stem cells from donors – resulting in the production of donor sperm. So far, surrogate mice have fathered healthy offspring bearing donor mice genes, providing key proof of concept for the technique. But it is early days for the researchers, who are still fine-tuning the process for the larger animals and expect to generate that data in the coming years. This process ensures the surrogate sire is not producing a product that is gene-edited, because the output is coming from a donor whose genetic code has not been tinkered with, highlighted study author Jon Oatley of Washington State University. “The surrogate sire, even though he’s gene-edited … is serving as a vessel to produce an animal that would then go in and provide products for human consumption.” This is a departure from controversial genetically modified (GM) organisms, which entail the transfer of entire genes or groups of genes from one species to another. Gene-editing, however, is a form of genetic engineering that tweaks a living genome by deleting, modifying, or replacing DNA. “Sometimes … it’s not appreciated that we have been engineering animals for probably 10,000 years – ever since domestication of livestock,” Oatley said. “They were combining genetic material through forced reproduction, and therefore engineering a genome that may not have developed just through normal natural selection … we’re just doing it in a more precise and efficient manner.” The potential for off-target effects – whereby a proverbial snip in one area could affect another part of the genome – is a risk that is being vigilantly screened for, the researchers said. Meanwhile, Crispr has had some success in the livestock industry rendering animals resilient to opportune pathogens, for instance, researchers from the University of Edinburgh have made pigs that appear to be immune to a virus that costs the swine industry billions each year. The major impediment to the widespread adoption of gene-editing technology is government regulation. In the EU, for instance, gene-editing of plants and animals is governed by the strict laws that govern GM organisms (GMOs). But the technology can easily be slotted into production in sparsely regulated South American countries such as Argentina and Brazil, the researchers said. The technology is unlikely be commercialised if regulated as a GMO, said Dr Alison Van Eenennaam from the University of California, who was not involved in the study. These researchers have a long way to go in proving the technology works in actual livestock but public perception, which plays a role in shaping regulation, will probably be swayed by activist groups that have historically mounted intense opposition, she stressed. “All that does is slow down the rate of genetic improvement, which has a negative impact on the overall sustainability of agriculture.” Prof Bruce Whitelaw — another author of the surrogate sire study — struck a more optimistic tone, suggesting societal attitudes were changing. “I wouldn’t go as far as to say that there is general acceptance around gene-editing technology, but there certainly is a shift in realising that this technology can contribute.”",https://media.guim.co.uk/a97e52aa619d3043fb996bbc9eb862352c07df05/0_0_5760_3456/500.jpg,0.07673197751322752

Against original expectations, the pandemic has been good for flogging expensive iPhones, dinky headphones and smartwatches. Homeworking has helped. Yet Apple is only one company and the bigger conundrum is baffling. What explains the rip-roaring recovery in wider stock markets since March in the face of bleak economic news? How has the broadly based S&amp;P 500 index in the US managed to hit a record high, as it did on Tuesday? Even when one adds Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft to the list of index-boosters, the recovery is mystifying. The S&amp;P has climbed more than 50% since its pandemic low, a performance that puts the bounce-back after the dramatic, but ultimately inconsequential, crash of 1987 in the shade. Is it confidence that a V-shaped recovery is in progress if only we’d look beyond day-to-day headlines? Is it the wondrous work of the US Federal Reserve in forcing down bond yields via quantitative easing (QE) so that shares can appear to be relative bargains in a zero-rate financial world? Here’s an alternative view, courtesy of James Montier of influential Boston-based fund manager GMO in an entertaining blast this week: “The US stock market appears to be absurd.” Montier’s arguments are worth noting, not least because he was in the bullish camp at the depth of the sell-off a few months ago. First, the “it’s QE, stupid” thesis looks fishy. In each of three major rounds of QE in the US from 2009-15, yields on 10-year US Treasury paper ended the period higher than when the Fed went into action. So investors are placing a lot of trust in the power of the Fed’s financial medicine on the basis of little supporting evidence. “Fed-based explanations are at best ex-post justifications for the performance of the stock market,” reckons Montier. Second, he is surely right that a V-shaped recovery, while impossible to dismiss entirely, is one of the least likely outcomes. The paths of unemployment, business investment, lockdowns, second waves of infection and consumer spending are all gloriously unclear. A sensible long-term investor, argues Montier, would want “a margin of safety” before plunging into a market that is one of the most expensive of all time when judged by traditional price-to-earnings yardsticks. As he puts it, the US market in particular (because valuations elsewhere are less extreme) has “priced in a truly Panglossian future where everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds”. The outside chance of good news is being priced as a certainty. One can make a case for excepting a few stocks if one wishes (and perhaps Apple is an example) but old-fashioned notions of risk seem to have been widely abandoned amid the overdose of optimism. Absurd is the right description. Rail needs permanent reform The rate of increase in rail fares in January – 1.6% if the usual mechanical formula based on July’s inflation figure is applied, or zero if ministers are pragmatic – is not the most pressing issue on the railways. The top priority is how to replace rail franchising, which was suspended for six months in March when emergency measures agreements, or EMAs, transferred all cost and revenue risks to the government to keep trains running. Operators currently get a flat management fee to run under-populated services. It should be obvious that a return to old-style franchising is impossible; a discredited system is now also unviable. The operators aren’t going to accept revenue risks when long-term demand for rail travel is wildly unpredictable; even when the pandemic passes, demand on commuter routes will be permanently altered by employers’ embrace of flexible and homeworking arrangements. And the government has no real power to force operators to accept rigid terms; the companies could just hand back the keys. It is why some form of central control – semi-nationalisation, or a contracting model – looks inevitable. Nor should it be controversial. In the debate about how best to reform the structure of the railways, the consensus had shifted anyway towards a management-fee set-up even before Covid arrived. Next month the government is likely merely to extend the EMAs while adding a few tweaks, such as ordering operators to adjust service frequencies on certain routes. That’s a reasonable fudge for the time being but a system of emergency arrangements, renewed every six months, will soon frustrate everybody. Permanent structural reform was overdue before March, and is definitely needed now. Let’s see it.",https://media.guim.co.uk/43eb56d587967f0d76a0fc11680f43f81b209122/0_78_5724_3435/500.jpg,0.04920977856163041

It’s for country kids and it’s for city kids. It’s for black kids and it’s for white kids. You can be fat and play on the line. You can be skinny and play wide receiver. Or you can be an unremarkable athlete like Tom Brady and win multiple Super Bowls. That appraisal might come off a wee bit harsh for a living legend regarded by many as the greatest of all quarterbacks, the position that’s been called the most demanding in team sports. But there was indeed a time – before the six NFL titles and nine Super Bowl appearances (records both), the Tag Heuer ads and glossy magazine covers, the tabloid-fodder romances with Hollywood starlets and Brazilian supermodels – when Brady was decidedly one of us: a lightly regarded prospect with a nascent dad bod selected in the later rounds of the 2000 draft as an understudy to an established star. Even after he burst from relative obscurity early in the 2001 season, coming off the bench for injured starter Drew Bledsoe to helm the perennially underachieving New England Patriots to an improbable maiden championship in the foggy wake of 9/11, he was no more than the fresh-faced, dimple-chinned California kid next door who came through to win the big one. Owing to decades of hard work, meticulous preparation, uncanny nerve/sangfroid, a hair-trigger release and good fortune, Brady is still today among the NFL’s finest players as he launches his second act with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers following 20 seasons in New England. If there is a 2020 season, he will be 43 when it starts. Whatever common ground he cohabited with mortals like us was ceded sometime back in the mid-aughts after his third Super Bowl title in four years or his epochal 2007 campaign. And as his preposterous, panoramic career has stretched forward long past the age when quarterbacks are put out to pasture, the answer to the million-dollar question – What’s the secret? – has only appreciated in value. Brady’s trajectory from everyman to superman embodies the allure of upward mobility at the essence of the American dream, which for the particular generation that came of age watching him surgically pick apart secondaries with numbing efficiency – the first in modern US history bound to end up poorer than their parents – has increasingly been exposed as a false bill of goods, as hollow and unattainable as a fairytale. But for the past few years Brady has bottled, packaged and sold this fantasy with a wellness-cum-lifestyle brand called TB12™. The company, which has brick-and-mortar sports therapy centers in downtown Boston and next door to the Patriots’ home stadium in the bucolic suburb of Foxborough, peddles everything from nutritional supplements, home workout equipment and nutritional products all centered around his New York Times best-selling tome The TB12 Method: How to Achieve a Lifetime of Sustained Peak Performance. The packaging is as slick and polished as the pitchman on the cover, but the dubious science behind much of the product line is certain to leave more discriminating customers deflated. In the book Brady attributes his freakish longevity and durability to the pseudoscientific concept of “muscle pliability”, a loosely defined concept invented by his “body coach” turned business partner Alex Guerrero, a controversial self-taught exercise guru who has twice been investigated by the Federal Trade Commission – first in 2005 for falsely passing himself off as a doctor and claiming to be able to cure cancer, Aids, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease with a dietary supplement called Supreme Greens, then seven years later for a sports drink called NeuroSafe (infamously endorsed by Brady), which he promised could prevent concussions. That muscle pliability as a concept is roundly rejected by exercise scientists is beside the point; as Brady’s scripture professes: “Feeling better – that’s the key” The highly restrictive diet required of adherents is outlined in more granular detail in the since-discontinued TB12™ Nutrition Manual, which retailed for $200 and quickly sold out: a “living document” including “a library of 89 seasonally-inspired recipes that you can use to support your TB12-aligned nutrition plan”. In addition to well-documented no-nos like sugary foods and other processed carbohydrates, Brady eschews “nightshade” fruits and vegetables including peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms and eggplants – New York magazine famously reported that he never ate a strawberry in his life – and leans heavily toward “alkaline” foods like nuts and legumes which he claims prevent bone fractures (incorrectly, empirically) and fight “inflammation” (whatever that is). Most of these wares, like Brady’s Vitalfit™ Tart Cherry recovery capsules ($45), are pricey if innocuous supplements that might otherwise be found on aspirational lifestyle platforms like Goop. Others like the more recent addition of TB12™ PROTECT, an “immunity blend” which promises to “activate your immune system and counter stress-induced immune suppression” and has been criticized for pandering to people’s fear of contracting Covid-19, wouldn’t feel out of place alongside the DNA Force Plus, Ultimate Bone Broth Formula and less abashed snake oil hawked by Infowars grand poobah Alex Jones. Brady’s evolution into the Nietzschean superman, the touchdown-tossing übermensch who believes the rules don’t apply to him, has come to divide public opinion but failed to meaningfully undercut his celebrity and commercial appeal. For those who are able to put aside or compartmentalize the pattern of rule-bending and skulduggery that has resurfaced throughout his career, including a quarter-season suspension for being “at least generally aware” of plain old cheating in 2015, it’s hard to begrudge him the spoils of his success and right to leverage his brand for supplementary financial gain, even in the peddling of baseless health claims. Caveat emptor, no? It’s an industry at least as old as Be Like Mike. Buy the sneakers. Eat the cereal. Not only can you watch me, you can be me. But at a time when anti-science sentiment has been mainstreamed to an alarming extent (see: the flourishing anti-vax, anti-GMO and climate crisis denial movements), it’s equally hard to ignore where Brady’s racket fits in with the broader trend of influencers selling products under the “wellness” and “lifestyle” categories because they don’t meet the higher criteria of science. And yet still: Is this not only another iteration of the American dream? These United States carry a long and often amusing tradition of rapscallions, hucksters and charlatans who have made their bones by trading on glamour, charisma and the promise of miracles: from Professor Harold Hill to PT Barnum to John R Brinkley to Elizabeth Holmes to Brady’s good friend Donald Trump. If ever there were a grand unifying theory to this improbable experiment, it’s this: you can’t knock the hustle. Brady’s junk science is on the whole no more pernicious than the televangelists or carnival barkers who have separated generations of marks from their money. The American dream is hard enough to achieve the first time. Leave it to the golden boy from San Mateo to manage it twice.",https://media.guim.co.uk/e491461b0efa404214672d35259daf0ed33e25df/0_132_6000_3600/500.jpg,0.10043580313491819

Coverage continues at our latest coronavirus live blog. Good morning, good evening, hello, wherever you might be. This is Helen Davidson taking the reins of the blog for the next few hours. Thanks to my colleagues for their coverage. We’ll be starting a new blog shortly, but in the meantime here is some more news on the vaccine front. In Australia a potential vaccine developed by the University of Queensland is now ready to be tested on humans, Brisbane’s Sunday Mail reports. The human testing of the “molecular clamp” vaccine candidate, to start on Monday, follows encouraging results from animal testing trials conducted in the Netherlands. Professor Robert Booy, head of Clinical Research at the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance, said the animal trials would have “ticked all the boxes” allowing the human testing to go ahead. “There is no way the research team would be able to progress from animals to humans without a complete guarantee of safety and they would likely have a confidence in its effectiveness,” he said. Here the latest key developments at a glance: Infections in the US state of Texas rose by 10,351 on Saturday to 250,462 in total, the highest single-day increase in the state since the pandemic started. US president Donald Trump has appeared in public wearing a mask for the first time during a visit to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center outside Washington, after previously refusing to wear one and ridiculing some who did. Brazil, the world’s second biggest coronavirus hotspot after the United States, recorded 1,071 new deaths from the outbreak on Saturday, taking the total official death toll to 71,469. Michelle Bolsonaro, the wife of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who is sick with coronavirus, said on Saturday that she and her two daughters had tested negative for the virus. Thousands of Israelis were protesting in Tel Aviv on Saturday against the government’s handling of the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic, resulting in violent clashes with police. The British government has drawn up a list of 20 councils in England facing the worst coronavirus outbreaks, with Bradford, Sheffield and Kirklees identified as areas in which localised lockdowns could be imposed. South Africa’s confirmed coronavirus cases have doubled in just two weeks to over 250,000. Lebanon’s number of new coronavirus infections increased for a third consecutive day to a record 86. Florida’s Walt Disney World opened to the public for the first time in four months, despite a surge of coronavirus cases in the state. That’s all from me, my colleagues in Australia are going to take over now. Goodnight! Chinese vaccine developer CanSino Biologics is in talks with Russia, Brazil, Chile and Saudi Arabia to launch a Phase III trial of its experimental Covid-19 vaccine, its co-founder said on Saturday. China’s success in driving down Covid-19 infections has made it harder to conduct large-scale vaccine trials, and so far only a few countries have agreed to work with it, Reuters reports. “We are contacting Russia, Brazil, Chile and Saudi Arabia (for the Phase III trial), and it’s still in discussion,” Qiu Dongxu, executive director and co-founder of CanSino, told an anti-viral drug development conference in Suzhou, in eastern China. He said its Phase III trial was likely to start “pretty soon,” and the company plans to recruit 40,000 participants for the test. Its Covid-19 candidate, Ad5-nCov, became the first in China to move into human testing in March but is running behind other potential vaccines in terms of trial progress. Two experimental vaccines developed by Sinovac Biotech and a unit of China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) are already approved for Phase III trials. Qiu said its Phase II trial involving 508 people has yielded “much better” results than the Phase I about the safety and ability to trigger immune response. He did not disclose specific evidence. He said its new factory under construction in China will allow it to produce 100-200 million doses of coronavirus vaccines per year by early 2021. Brazil, the world’s second biggest coronavirus hotspot after the United States, recorded 1,071 new deaths from the outbreak on Saturday, with a total of 1,839,850 confirmed cases. Brazil has now recorded a total of 71,469 deaths, the health ministry said. A demonstration in Tel Aviv against the Israeli government’s handling of the pandemic, which we reported on earlier, has resulted in violent clashes between protesters and police. This from the journalist Louis Fishman: My colleagues Robin McKie and James Tapper have written a piece on whether England might follow the lead of 120 other countries and make mask wearing mandatory in public spaces. US president Donald Trump has appeared in public wearing a mask for the first time during a visit to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center outside Washington, where he was set to meet wounded soldiers and front-line health care workers. Trump had previously refused to wear masks at public engagements, although pictures showing him in a mask during a tour of the Ford Rawsonville Components Plant in Ypsilanti, Michigan, where ventilators, masks and other medical supplies are being manufactured, emerged in May. A state attorney general had called Trump a “petulant child” because he allegedly refused to wear the covering during the tour. Trump later claimed he had worn a mask behind the scenes, saying: “I wore one in the back area. I didn’t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it.” Infections in the US state of Texas rose by 10,351 on Saturday to 250,462 in total, the highest single-day increase in the state since the pandemic started. Current hospitalisations in Texas rose by 81 to a record high of 10,083 on Saturday, the state health department said. The New York Times reported earlier that in the popular beachfront vacation spot of Corpus Christi hardly any new infections were recorded in early June, before out-of-towners brought the virus back. Now the city of 325,000 has one of the fastest-growing outbreaks in Texas. Canada’s oil-producing province of Alberta, hard-hit by lockdowns caused by the coronavirus pandemic, is counting on National Hockey League (NHL) games to provide a badly needed boost to morale and business, Reuters reports. Edmonton, the provincial capital and home to the NHL’s Edmonton Oilers, will be a hub city with Toronto when games resume on 1 August, the first since the league suspended the season in March. Each city will host 12 teams, sequestering players in so-called bubbles that encompass arenas, hotels and select restaurants. Fans will not attend the games. The spread of coronavirus has eased in Canada, allowing the two cities to beat out rivals such as Las Vegas, which has seen increased infections, for the chance to host the games. Alberta premier Jason Kenney said hosting games could generate C$60m ($44.16m) in economic activity. “That alone is not going to turn around our economy, but it’s a great shot in the arm,” he said. Oilers and Toronto Maple Leafs officials abruptly postponed news conferences on Saturday to discuss the hub cities, citing incomplete talks between the Canadian government and the league. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman told reporters the league needed to finalise “a couple of details” with Ottawa. Alberta’s unemployment rate was the second-highest in Canada in June as a crash in oil prices this spring forced energy companies to lay off workers and some businesses remained closed due to the pandemic. Alberta’s chief medical officer has reassured the public that arriving hockey players will not accelerate the spread of the virus if they abide by certain conditions, which include daily testing and restricted movement. Covid-19 has killed at least 561,551 people since the outbreak emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP on Saturday. At least 12,580,980 cases of coronavirus have been registered in 196 countries and territories. Of these, at least 6,706,700 are now considered recovered. The tallies, using data collected from national authorities and information from the World Health Organization (WHO), probably reflect only a fraction of the actual number of infections. A group of 14 doctors in France called on Saturday for stricter rules on the wearing of masks to ensure there was no resurgence of the coronavirus, Agence France-Presse reports. In an open letter published in the daily newspaper Le Parisien-Aujourd’hui, the doctors, from a range of disciplines, noted that people were beginning to neglect the basic social distancing precautions. “It would be most unfortunate if these effective and accessible methods were not used,” they added. They recommended the compulsory wearing of masks inside public buildings, social distancing as much as possible and the regular washing of hands. While acknowledging that masks could be uncomfortable to wear, they insisted on their importance. “Wearing a mask is not only to protect yourself, but also to prevent the spread of the virus; as long as everyone wears it,” they wrote. Their message echoed Friday’s appeal by the prime minister, Jean Castex, and the health minister, Olivier Veran, as the first wave of holidaymakers prepared to set off this weekend. They called on people to stay vigilant and to keep wearing masks to avoid a second wave of the coronavirus. France’s health authority noted on Friday that the level of infections had begun to pick up again even if, for the moment, the numbers remained low. France’s total Covid-19 death toll rose above 30,000 on Friday. The British government has drawn up a list of 20 councils in England facing the worst coronavirus outbreaks, with Bradford, Sheffield and Kirklees identified as areas needing “enhanced support”, according to a classified document leaked to the Observer and the Guardian. As evidence mounts that the relaxation of lockdown rules is leading to a resurgence of Covid-19 in some of England’s most deprived and ethnically mixed areas, councils fear the data will be used to enforce more local lockdowns of the kind imposed in Leicester, where all but essential shops must stay shut, schoolchildren have been sent home, and pubs and restaurants remain closed. My colleague Juliette Garside has more. Lebanon’s number of new coronavirus infections increased for a third consecutive day to a record 86, the government said on Saturday. Lebanon has recorded 2,168 infections and 36 deaths since February. The health minister, Hamad Hassan, told Reuters on Friday the spike was partly due to expatriates who came after the airport was reopened on 1 July. One infected 12 people at a wedding and another infected 12 at a funeral, he said. A second cluster of infections had appeared among nurses and doctors and a third among refuse collectors, Hassan added. Ten thousand Israelis are protesting in Tel Aviv on Saturday against the government’s handling of the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the Haaretz newspaper reports. On Friday, leaders from hospitality, tourism, transportation, arts and culture industries declined an invitation by the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to discuss the situation. “The Israeli government and its leader are responsible for the failure in implementing aid programs,” said the organisers, who called on the government to amend its financial aid packages. “I have 40 workers with no income, no money,” said Michal Gaist-Casif, vice president of a sound and lighting company, according to Reuters. “We need the government to pump in money until we’re back to normal. We haven’t been working since mid-March through April, May, June and July, and August is looking to be a catastrophe.” On Thursday, Netanyahu and the finance minister, Yisrael Katz, announced that Israel’s self-employed will receive an immediate grant of 7,500 shekels ($2,150). Organisers of the demonstration asked that those attending the protest not give the police a reason to stop the event, urging them to comply with health ministry guidelines. Florida’s Walt Disney World opened to the public for the first time in four months, despite a surge of coronavirus cases in the state. The Walt Disney Company welcomed a limited number of guests to parts of its sprawling Orlando complex, the most-visited theme park resort in the world, with a host of safety measures in place to reassure visitors and reduce the chances of catching the virus. Executives felt confident they had developed a responsible plan for reopening in phases during the pandemic, said Josh D’Amaro, chairman of Disney’s parks, experiences and products division, according to Reuters. “This is the new world that we’re operating in, and I don’t see that changing anytime soon,” D’Amaro said in an interview on Saturday after he greeted guests and workers at the park. Disney’s reopening of parks in Asia helped provide assurance about moving ahead in Florida, he said. “I feel really good about our environment. We’re taking this seriously.” At the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom, the two parks that opened on Saturday, guests and employees wore face masks, underwent temperature screenings and were told to social distance everywhere, from streets to rides. Plexiglass separated rows in lines and ground markings indicated where people should stand. The resort suspended parades, fireworks and other activities that create crowds, as well as up-close encounters with Mickey Mouse, Cinderella and other characters. Instead, characters appeared on floats or on horseback. Some pictures on Twitter showed people close together while waiting to enter. Disney employees, called cast members, began enforcing distancing requirements after about 30 minutes, one person said. Florida has emerged as a centre of Covid-19 infections. Over the past two weeks, Florida reported 109,000 new coronavirus cases, more than any other US state. Still, many Disney fans and workers were eager for Disney World to open its gates. The resort employs 77,000 people. One of India’s best known movie stars, Amitabh Bachchan, has tested positive for Covid-19 together with his actor son Abhishek Bachchan, and both have been moved to a private hospital, the actors said late on Saturday. “I have tested COVID positive ... shifted to hospital ... hospital informing authorities ... family and staff undergone tests, results awaited,” Amitabh Bachchan, 77, said in a tweet, which was shared 58,000 times in just over half an hour. His son Abhishek Bachchan, 44, said in a tweet minutes later that he had also tested positive. The Bollywood actors were admitted to Nanavati Hospital in Mumbai, India’s financial and entertainment hub, and several other members of the high-profile family were tested for the virus. A Bollywood legend, Amitabh Bachchan has been leading the way in the country’s fight against the coronavirus, appearing in public service advertisements. The United Kingdom’s death toll from confirmed cases of Covid-19 rose to 44,798, up 148 on the previous day, the government said on Saturday. Michelle Bolsonaro, the wife of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, said on Saturday that she and her two daughters had tested negative for the virus. The president announced that he had tested positive on Tuesday, and said he was quarantining while also taking the drug hydroxychloroquine, according to Reuters. More than 1.8 million people in Brazil have tested positive for coronavirus and more than 70,000 have died. Only the United States has worse statistics. Michelle Bolsonaro, whose grandmother was rushed to hospital and intubated last week, made the announcement on Instagram. Hundreds of holidaymakers from Germany are said to have partied at the Ballermann fun mile in Mallorca while disregarding social distancing rules in Spain. A video published on Saturday by the Mallorca Zeitung shows people celebrating, drinking and dancing in crowds on Friday evening on the famous Bierstrasse (beer street). People on social media reacted with outrage to the clip. Authorities in Mallorca and the other Balearic Islands have tightened face mask requirements. They will need to be worn in all enclosed public spaces from Monday. The Zimbabwean embassy in London has said that at least 37 citizens of the southern African country have died in Britain during the coronavirus pandemic, Sky News reports. Qualified nurses and doctors from Zimbabwe have long been recruited to help relieve staff shortages in the UK, but the total number of Zimbabweans working in the health sector is small. However, the number of deaths recorded by consular officials suggests that Zimbabweans may constitute well over 10% of all frontline workers who have died in Britain during the coronavirus crisis. This startling disclosure suggests that Zimbabweans have proven particularly vulnerable in the UK and a team of researchers and medical experts are trying to grapple with the reasons why. “This is something that we all need to focus on and we need to do it urgently,” said Brighton Chireka, a Zimbabwean doctor who founded the Zimbabwean Diaspora Health Alliance, an organisation that has been collecting evidence and allegations from thousands of Zimbabweans and other ethnic minority health workers during the epidemic. South Africa’s confirmed coronavirus cases have doubled in just two weeks to a quarter of a million as the pandemic exposes stark health inequalities in the country. In Johannesburg, the centre of South Africa’s outbreak, badly needed oxygen concentrators, which help Covid-19 patients to breathe, are hard to find as private businesses and individuals buy up supplies, a public health specialist volunteering at a field hospital, Lynne Wilkinson, told the Associated Press. Meanwhile, South Africas public hospitals are short on medical oxygen and they are now seeing a higher proportion of deaths than private ones, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases says. South Africa now has more than 250,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, including more than 3,800 deaths. To complicate matters, the country’s troubled power utility has announced electricity cuts in the dead of winter as a cold front brings freezing weather. Many of the country’s urban poor live in shacks of scrap metal and wood. More than 8,000 health workers across Africa have been infected, half of them in South Africa. The governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, has said during a press conference on the Covid-19 crisis that 427 additional cases of the drug Remdesivir had been delivered to Florida’s hospitals. He said the drug was unlikely to make a difference for severely ill patients, but was likely to help many patients “as they come in” while only mildly ill with Covid-19. The rate of coronavirus infections among care staff in the state stood at 2.4% after 70,000 tests, DeSantis said, a number he described as “very, very low”. The governor added that 12 “Covid-only” nursing home facilities had been created across Florida, and that the state was working on expanding the number of beds in these units from 750. DeSantis advised “vulnerable” people in high-risk groups to continue to avoid contact with others, and warned that socialising indoors with other households would increase transmission. DeSantis emphasised the need for children to attend school again, and said online tuition could not be a substitute for in-person attendance, adding that he believes the negative impact of non-attendance outweighs the risk of transmission among pupils. Israeli police on Saturday said they had flooded central Tel Aviv with officers and closed main thoroughfares, ahead of a rally by critics of the government’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis. “Hundreds of police will be deployed in a number of security cordons,” a police statement said, according to Agence France-Presse. “The mission is protection of the participants and preservation of public order.” Organisers of the demonstration said they expected thousands of Israel’s self-employed to turn out in protest at what they say is the government’s abandonment of them after forcing their businesses to close under coronavirus regulations. Student unions said they would also take part in the event at the city’s Rabin Square to show their concern at the large numbers of young people made jobless by closures. Israel imposed a broad lockdown from the middle of March, allowing only staff deemed essential to go to work and banning public assembly. Places of entertainment were closed, hitting the leisure industry hard. Facing public and economic pressure, the government eased restrictions in late May. But infection numbers rose and rules were tightened again, including the closure of event venues, clubs, bars, gyms and public pools. While salaried workers on furlough received unemployment benefits, the self-employed said most had been waiting months for promised government aid to reach them. “There is a very grave crisis of confidence between us and the government,” Shai Berman, one of the protest organisers, told Israeli public radio. “We are part of a very large public which is feeling growing distress and wants to demonstrate and simply does not believe the promises,” he added. On Friday the health ministry announced the highest number of coronavirus infections over a 24-hour period, with nearly 1,500 new cases confirmed. The country of roughly 9 million has registered more than 36,000 cases, including over 350 deaths. Infections in the US state of Arizona rose by 3,038 on Saturday to 119,930 in total. The number of people currently hospitalised with Covid-19 in the state rose by 53 to a record of 3,485 as of Friday. The state health department said that the occupancy rate of adult intensive care unit (ICU) beds in Arizona rose to 90% as of Friday from 89% the previous day. The number of recorded coronavirus infections in the US state of Florida rose by 10,360 in the 24 hours to Saturday to a total of 254,511. As of Saturday morning, 7,239 people in the state are hospitalised with Covid-19, according to the state health department. The state’s governor, Ron DeSantis, will be holding a press conference shortly, which can be watched live here. Hello, I’m taking over from my colleague Damien Gayle. Please feel free to message me with relevant updates or tips, you can get me on Twitter @JedySays or via email. Here are the main developments so far in coronavirus-related news around the world today: India’s coronavirus cases have passed 800,000 with the biggest increase, of 27,114 cases, in the past 24 hours, causing nearly a dozen states to impose a partial lockdown in high-risk areas. The new confirmed cases took the national total to 820,916. The health ministry on Saturday also reported another 519 deaths for a total of 22,123. Russia was fast approaching three-quarters of a million coronavirus cases on Saturday, as its latest update reported 6,611 new infections, taking its nationwide tally to 720,547. The country’s coronavirus crisis response centre said 188 people had died from the virus in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 11,205. Dozens of US marines have been infected with coronavirus at two bases on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa in what is feared to be a significant outbreak. Okinawa prefectural officials said they could say only a few dozen cases had been found recently because the US military asked that the exact figure not be released. A Briton and a Tunisian are among 71 people arrested in Serbia after a fourth night of rioting in Belgrade and other cities against the government’s management of the coronavirus pandemic and growing authoritarianism. Thousands of people demonstrated in several cities on Friday, with protesters hurling stones at police in front of parliament in the capital. Bill Gates has called for Covid-19 drugs and any eventual vaccine to be made available to countries and people that need them most, not to the highest bidder, saying that relying on market forces to ensure their distribution would prolong the pandemic. He said efforts that began two decades ago to battle the global HIV/Aids crisis could serve as a model for making Covid-19 medicines widely accessible. The European parliament has voted to temporarily derogate certain restrictions around clinical trials of drugs containing genetically modified organisms to speed up the development of a coronavirus vaccine. MEPs on Friday used an “urgent procedure” process to adopt a new regulation to speed up the development of Covid-19 treatments and vaccines containing GMOs. The UK is set to make the wearing of face masks mandatory in shops, in the latest attempt to try to curb the spread of coronavirus. Boris Johnson, the prime minister, last night vowed to “get stricter” on their use and said he was “looking at ways of making sure” that more people covered their faces indoors. Wearing masks in shops is already mandatory in Scotland. The British pilot who spent two months on life support in Vietnam as the country’s most at-risk Covid-19 patient was on his way home on Saturday, astounding doctors who gave him just a 10% chance of survival. Stephen Cameron, 42, was the sickest Covid-19 patient medics had to treat in Vietnam, which has recorded no deaths. Belgium’s government has told its citizens not to travel to Leicester, the UK city currently facing tighter lockdown measures during a rise in Covid-19 infections. Advice from the Belgian foreign affairs department states that “travel is not allowed” and “quarantine is mandatory upon your return”. Two people in London have been arrested after protesters dyed the fountains in Trafalgar Square blood-red, in a stunt calling for the government to prevent future pandemics by ending animal farming. The Animal Rebellion group said they staged the protest to call on the government to tell the truth about the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, which they say was caused by animal exploitation. While activists poured dye into the fountains, others staged a socially distanced protest on the square. Stephanie Zupan, a spokesperson for Animal Rebellion, said: The warnings from Covid-19 could not be starker. The government must now begin a transition towards a plant-based food system, or risk future zoonotic pandemics of catastrophic proportions. Their action was coordinated with actions in 20 other cities, including Bristol, Brighton, New York, Chicago, Toronto, Amsterdam and Barcelona. The activists said: “All of these acts of non-violent civil disobedience carried the message for governments to prevent future pandemics by ending animal farming and transitioning to a plant-based food system.” Scientists have welcomed Boris Johnson’s suggestion that face coverings may become mandatory in shops in England, a measure that they hope will help to curb the spread of coronavirus in the UK, which has one of the world’s highest death tolls from the outbreak. The prime minister said on Friday that he wanted to be “stricter” on insisting people wear coverings in confined spaces where they are meeting people they do not normally see. Face coverings are already mandatory in shops in Scotland, whose devolved administration sets its own health policy. Prof David Heymann, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the PA news agency that masks should be worn by “all people in a situation where no one can physically distance to prevent infection of others”. Face masks protect others from infection by catching virus-containing droplets when a person who is infected and has a high level of virus in the nasal passage speaks, shouts, sings, coughs or sneezes. Face masks should be worn when physical distancing cannot be assured from others, such as by carers in care homes, and by people serving others who are physically distancing but who, because of their work, cannot physically distance from them. They should also be worn by all people in a situation where no one can physically distance to prevent infection of others – especially in closed spaces, such as public transport. Face masks do not substitute for physical distancing if physical distancing is possible, and they do not protect the wearer from infection unless they are worn as part of personal protective equipment that also protects the eyes, a potential site of infection. Dr Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said Johnson was right to be reviewing England’s position on face coverings. He said it was unlikely that the scientific debate on the issue would be resolved anytime soon, but that shops may be an example of a place where it is not possible to maintain social distancing. Hunter also cautioned: “The most important thing, however, is that anyone wearing a mask must not assume that they are automatically protected. People should still practice distancing and continue to wash their hands.” Prof Adam Finn, of the University of Bristol, said that wearing face coverings in crowded places would reduce the likelihood of infection. The more efficient the face covering is at catching the droplets, the better it will work. So if you are in a shop and everyone else is wearing a mask, you should feel safer than if they aren’t. However, a University College London epidemiologist, Dr Antonio Lazzarino, said he was worried masks were “a pretence to ease the lockdown to help the economy”. This may well happen at the expense of people’s health. Lockdown is the only measure that is proven to work. Earlier this week, the World Health Organization acknowledged there was “emerging evidence” that Covid-19 could be spread through particles in the air. Holiday businesses in Wales have begun adjusting to the “new normal”, with unprecedented levels of demand as lockdown restrictions ease coming as a major boost to an economy that relies heavily on tourism, according to the PA news agency. Tourism supports around 120,000 jobs in Wales - nearly 10% of the country’s workforce - and contributes more than £3bn to the economy. Saturday saw the reopening of tourism across the country as self-contained accommodation providers were able to open cottages, bed and breakfasts and caravans for the first time since March. Tommy Davies runs Coed-Y-Glyn Log Cabins, a set of 5-star riverside lodges in the north Wales village of Glyndyfrdwy, Denbighshire. He told the PA news agency: We’re doing virtual check-ins now. We’ve only got four lodges so we could usually give it quite a personal touch and either myself or another member of staff will go down and welcome the guest personally, shake their hand, ask how their journey was. Obviously we can’t do that any more. Now we give them pre-arrival emails with all the stuff they would normally get, and FaceTime them when they arrive. So what we can’t do is the personal touch, in every sense of the word. So we’ll have to adapt and change. This is the new normal. The reopening also came as a huge relief to Three Cliffs Bay Holiday Park, near the sandy beach of the same name in Gower, Swansea, which relies heavily on its summer trade. Due to the current restrictions, the site will only be operating at 15% capacity at first, with 23 motor home and caravan pitches and space for more than 110 tents once shared camping facilities are allowed in Wales from 25 July. Its owner, Tom Beynon, said he felt “blessed” after taking 300 bookings on Friday alone, leading to him having to employ an extra person to staff the company’s phone, while his website also crashed due to demand. He said: Being closed has been pretty damaging. We’re one of these businesses that plough on in the winter getting ready to recoup near the summer. We, as a family, have worked over a long time to build up the businesses we’ve crafted, but people have really looked after us. You began to wonder would they go to England instead or do something else, because everyone’s had a tough time. We’ve had 300 bookings Friday, five nights per booking, people have really backed us and are booking it as their main holiday. It’s phenomenal, we’ve never experienced demand like that. We’re very pleased, and in a lot better shape now than we were on Thursday. Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has welcomed figures showing there were no Covid-19 deaths in Scotland in the last 24 hours. Thirty-eight people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths in hospitals to 29,051, according to the PA Media news agency. The patients were aged between 40 and 98 and three patients, aged 65 to 86 years, had no known underlying health conditions, NHS England said. Another seven deaths were reported with no positive Covid-19 test result. Meanwhile, Scotland reported no new coronavirus deaths in the last 24 hours, according to the Scottish government. A total of 2,490 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, no change on Friday’s figure. The latest figures show that 18,340 people have tested positive for the virus in Scotland, up by seven from 18,333 the day before. A total of six patients are in intensive care with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, a fall of six on the previous day. Belgium’s government has told its citizens not to travel to Leicester, the UK city currently facing tighter lockdown measures during a rise in Covid-19 infections, the PA Media news agency reports. Advice from the Belgian foreign affairs department states that “travel is not allowed” and “quarantine is mandatory upon your return”. Leicester has been put in a “red zone” of risky destinations in Belgium’s travel advice, alongside regions in Portugal and Spain. The city became the first in England to have tighter restrictions reimposed on June 30, after an increase in Covid-19 infections was recorded. The regularly updated Belgian advice is based on “currently available information”, according to a note on the government’s website. It also gives the go-ahead for travel to other areas of the EU, the Schengen zone and other parts of the United Kingdom. A Briton and a Tunisian are among 71 people arrested in Serbia after a fourth night of rioting in Belgrade and other cities against the government’s management of the coronavirus pandemic and growing authoritarianism, according to AFP. Thousands of people demonstrated in several cities on Friday, with protesters hurling stones at police in front of parliament in the capital. Some protesters also threw firecrackers and chanted nationalist slogans in Belgrade, according to AFP journalists. “Among those arrested are many foreign nationals from Bosnia, Montenegro but also from Great Britain and Tunisia,” the police chief, Vladimir Rebic, said at a press conference. Photographs of the British and Tunisian passports of two men were shown on a screen. According to local media, mostly tabloids close to power, the Briton is 24 years old, while the Tunisian is 54. “These are the documents with which they entered Serbia,” said Rebic, who added that he intends to examine the influence of “these foreign factors on the violence of the demonstrations”. “Serbia welcomed them hoping that they would come to have a good time with us, but they came to destroy and attack the police.” Fourteen police officers were injured in Friday’s clashes, and 130 since the protests began on Tuesday, the police chief said. No figures have been given for the number of injured protesters. The protesters have vented their frustration with President Aleksandar Vucic, who is seen by many as having facilitated a second wave of the virus by lifting an initial lockdown so that elections could be held on 21 June in which his Serbian Progressive party (SNS) largely won. The first demonstration on Tuesday was triggered after Vucic announced the return of a weekend curfew to combat a second wave of coronavirus infections that has overwhelmed hospitals in Belgrade. While the government backtracked on the curfew, the protests have continued against a leader accused of trampling on Serbia’s democratic institutions. “The pressure cooker is now exploding,” Nemanja Rujevic, a Bonn-based Serbian journalist, told AFP, adding that the “unhinged” management of the health crisis compounded long-running frustration over Vucic’s authoritarian rule. On Friday, the Serbian prime minister announced the highest daily number of deaths, 18, since the start of the pandemic in the Balkan country. The country has recorded more than 17,300 confirmed cases and 352 deaths since March and health authorities have warned that hospitals are almost full due to the latest surge in cases.

Dubai has announced a new package to help the economy cope with the effects of the coronavirus outbreak, worth 1.5 billion dirhams ($408 million). The crown prince of the emirate, Hamdan Bin Mohammed Al-Maktoum, made the announcement via his Twitter account on Saturday: The package is the third announced by Dubai, the second largest and wealthiest member of the United Arab Emirates federation. The three packages are worth a total of 6.3 billion dirhams, Sheikh Hamdan said. Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, has called for big gatherings such as weddings and wakes to be banned to stem a rise in coronavirus infections. During a televised address, Rouhani said: “We must ban ceremonies and gatherings all over the country, whether it be wakes, weddings or parties.” He said that “now is not the time for festivals or seminars”, adding that even university entrance exams may have to be suspended. Shortly after the address, a police official in Tehran announced the closure of all wedding and mourning venues in the capital until further notice. Iran has been gradually relaxing its lockdown since mid-April, but has recently reported a sharp rise in the infection rate. The death toll on Saturday rose by 188 over the previous 24 hours to 12,635, while the total number of diagnosed cases reached 255,117, up by 2,397 during the same period, the health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said on state TV. Rouhani and other officials have blamed the rise in infections partly on wedding parties, wakes and other public gatherings. During the same televised speech, Rouhani insisted the nation cannot afford to shut-down its sanctions-hit economy. Dozens of US marines have been infected with coronavirus at two bases on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa in what is feared to be a significant outbreak, the Associated Press reports. Okinawa prefectural officials said they could say only that a few dozen cases had been found recently because the US military asked that the exact figure not be released. The outbreaks occurred at Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, which is at the centre of a relocation dispute, and Camp Hansen, Okinawan officials said. Local media, citing unnamed sources, said about 60 people had been infected. “Okinawans are shocked by what we were told [by the US military],” governor Denny Tamaki told a news conference. He questioned disease prevention measures taken by the US military and renewed his demand for transparency regarding the latest development. Okinawan officials asked the US military on Friday to provide the number of cases and other details in order to address growing concerns among local residents, Tamaki said. The marines said in a statement on Friday that troops were taking additional protective measures to limit the spread of the virus and were restricting off-base activities. The statement said the measures “are to protect our forces, our families, and the local community”, without providing details on the infections. Okinawa is home to more than half of about 50,000 American troops based in Japan under a bilateral security pact, and the residents are sensitive to US base-related problems. Many Okinawans have long complained about pollution, noise and crime related to US bases. Emirates, the Middle East’s largest air carrier, has cut a tenth of its workforce during the pandemic in layoffs that could rise to 15%, or 9,000 jobs, its president said. The airline, which operates a fleet of 270 wide-bodied aircraft, halted operations in late March as part of global shutdowns to stem the spread of the virus. It resumed two weeks later on a limited network and plans to fly to 58 cities by mid-August, down from about 157 before the crisis. However, its president, Tim Clark, has said previously that it could take up to four years for operations to return to “some degree of normality”, and the airline has been staging rounds of layoffs, as recently as last week, without disclosing numbers. Before the crisis hit, Emirates employed some 60,000 staff, including 4,300 pilots and nearly 22,000 cabin crew, according to its annual report. Clark said in an interview with the BBC that the airline had already cut a tenth of its staff and that Emirates “will probably have to let go of a few more, probably up to 15%”. A company spokeswoman told AFP the airline had nothing to add to the report. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has said that airlines are in line to make a combined net loss of more than $84bn this year in the wake of the pandemic crisis, the biggest in the industry’s history. Clark said in the interview that Emirates was “not as badly off as others” but that the crisis hit just as it was “heading for one of our best years ever”. The Dubai-based airline had reported a bumper 21% rise in annual profits in March. Bosnian Muslims have held a memorial ceremony to mark the 25th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre – the worst atrocity on European soil since the second world war. Proceedings got under way on Saturday morning, with many mourners braving the tighter restrictions put in place to stem the spread of Covid-19. A ceremony laying to rest the remains of nine victims identified over the past year took place at the memorial cemetery in Potočari, a village just outside Srebrenica which served as the base for the UN protection force during the conflict. On 11 July, 1995, after capturing the town, Serb forces killed more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica in a few days. Sehad Hasanovic, 27, has a two-year-old daughter - the same age he was when he lost his father in the violence. “It’s difficult when you see someone calling their father and you don’t have one,” Hasanovic told AFP in tears, not dissuaded from attending the commemorations in spite of the virus. His father, Semso, “left to go into the forest and never returned. Only a few bones have been found,” said Hasanovic. Like his brother Sefik and father Sevko, Semso was killed when Bosnian Serb troops led by Ratko Mladić entered the Srebrenica enclave before systematically massacring Bosnian men and adolescents. Good afternoon, it’s Aaron Walawalkar in London here. I’ll be taking over the global coronavirus live blog while my colleague Damien Gayle has a break. Please share your updates with me via Twitter DM on @AaronWala. I may not be able respond to all of them, but will read them. Here are the main developments so far in coronavirus-related news around the world today: India’s coronavirus cases have passed 800,000 with the biggest increase, of 27,114 cases, in the past 24 hours, causing nearly a dozen states to impose a partial lockdown in high-risk areas. The new confirmed cases took the national total to 820,916. The health ministry on Saturday also reported another 519 deaths for a total of 22,123. Russia was fast approaching three-quarters of a million coronavirus cases on Saturday, as its latest update reported 6,611 new infections, taking its nationwide tally to 720,547. The country’s coronavirus crisis response centre said 188 people had died from the virus in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 11,205.

Wearing masks in shops is already mandatory in Scotland. The British pilot who spent two months on life support in Vietnam as the country’s most at-risk Covid-19 patient was on his way home on Saturday, astounding doctors who gave him just a 10% chance of survival. Stephen Cameron, 42, was the sickest Covid-19 patient medics had to treat in Vietnam, which has recorded no deaths. The president of Iran has said the country cannot afford to shut down its sanctions-hit economy, even as the nation reels from a second-wave coronavirus outbreak that has brought rising infections and record high death tolls. Iran must continue “economic, social and cultural activities while observing health protocols”, Hassan Rouhani said during a televised virus taskforce meeting on Saturday, according to AP. “The simplest solution is to close down all activities, (but) the next day, people would come out to protest the (resulting) chaos, hunger, hardship and pressure,” he added. Rouhani’s comments came as the health ministry reported 2,397 new cases over the past 24 hours on Saturday, taking the country’s total confirmed coronavirus cases to 255,117. Sima Sadat Lari, the health ministry spokeswoman, said 188 more people had died, taking the country’s total death toll to 12,635. So far, 217,666 have recovered and 3,338 remain in critical condition, said Lari. Iran has been struggling since late February to contain the country’s COVID-19 outbreak, the deadliest in the Middle East. The daily death toll has topped 100 since around mid-June, with a record single-day tally of 221 reported on Thursday. The outbreak’s rising toll has prompted authorities to make wearing masks mandatory in enclosed public spaces and to allow the hardest hit provinces to reimpose restrictive measures. Iran closed schools, cancelled public events and banned movement between its 31 provinces in March, but Rouhani’s government progressively lifted restrictions from April to reopen its sanctions-hit economy. “It is not possible to keep businesses and economic activities shut down in the long-term,” Rouhani said, emphasising that “the people will not accept this”. The health minister, Said Namaki, warned on Wednesday of a potential “revolt over poverty” and blamed US sanctions for the government’s “empty coffers”. The reopening of the economy “was not over our ignorance (of the virus’ dangers), but it was due to us being on our knees against an economy that could take no more”, Namaki said on state television. The British pilot who spent two months on life support in Vietnam as the country’s most at-risk Covid-19 patient was on his way home on Saturday, astounding doctors who gave him just a 10% chance of survival, AFP reports. Stephen Cameron, 42, was the sickest patient medics had had to treat during the coronavirus outbreak in Vietnam, which has recorded no official deaths following a fast and aggressive response to the pandemic. Little more than six weeks ago, they warned that Cameron would need a double transplant for his lungs, which were only functioning at around 10%. But after nearly four months in hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City, including 10 weeks on a ventilator, the Vietnam Airlines pilot from Motherwell, Scotland, was discharged on Saturday and was due to fly back to the UK within hours. “I’m overwhelmed by the generosity of the Vietnamese people, the dedication and professionalism of the doctors and nurses ... the odds say that I shouldn’t be here so I can only thank everybody here for what they’ve done,” Cameron said as he left Cho Ray hospital. “I go home with a happy heart because I’m going home, but a sad one because I’m leaving so many people here that I’ve made friends with.” Known as Patient 91, Cameron became the focus of media attention as the country’s top medical professionals met to brainstorm treatment options. The news that he would need a lung transplant was met with 59 donation offers, according to the health ministry. But after waking from a coma at the end of May, there were small signs of improvement – a thumbs-up sign for an attentive doctor, a trip on to the balcony to catch some sunshine and a video of him holding a Motherwell Football Club scarf aloft. On Saturday – as state media said his treatment bill had reached at least $150,000 – he was well enough to catch a repatriation flight to London, accompanied by three doctors. His return home comes as Vietnam celebrated 85 days with no community transmission of the coronavirus. The country has just 370 confirmed cases and zero deaths, but its borders remain largely shut. More than 10,000 people are in mandatory quarantine. At least two doctors in Syria’s north-west have been infected with the coronavirus, raising the total number of confirmed cases in the overcrowded rebel enclave to three, a monitoring group has told the Associated Press. Syrian opposition and militant groups control the Idlib area, which is home to more than 3 million people, most of them displaced by the war and living in tent camps and overcrowded facilities. Local health facilities have been targeted in Syrian government attacks that have recently displaced nearly another million people. The Early Warning and Alert Response Network, which reports on the virus, said the two doctors had been in touch with patient zero, another doctor who works in a hospital in Idlib. The first case was reported on Thursday and the hospital where the doctor works has since suspended its operations and quarantined patients and support staff to carry out testing. The enclave is now under threat of losing crucial humanitarian aid access. Moves by Russia, a major ally of the Syrian government, at the UN security council are threatening to shut down border crossings between the rebel-held enclave and Turkey. A divided security council failed for a second time on Friday to agree on extending humanitarian aid deliveries to the area from Turkey as the current UN mandate to do so ended. British tourists can expect “90% of normality” as flights and holidays restart for the UK’s biggest tour operator, but they need to be prepared for some changes and to follow local coronavirus rules, said Andrew Andrew Flintham, the managing director of Tui UK and Northern Ireland. Starting this weekend, the company will run a limited number of flights and holidays to the Spanish destinations of Ibiza, Lanzarote, Palma and Tenerife, the PA news agency reports. While new British quarantine rules mean travellers will no longer need to self-isolate when returning to or visiting the UK from certain countries, there are still foreign coronavirus regulations to consider. From Monday, the Balearic government has ruled that face masks must be worn on its islands at all times, apart from at beaches, swimming pools and while doing sports. Anyone breaking the rule in public spaces risks receiving a €100 fine. Travellers arriving in Ibiza have to fill in health check forms in advance and will have their temperature screened at the airport. Flintham acknowledge peopled would need to observe local rules said they would still “be able to enjoy the major amenities and the things that you really, really want”. He said: “The 90%, or the 85%, of the normality of your holiday is going to be there.” Under Covid-19 related changes, travellers can expect to see Tui cabin crew wearing masks and gloves while in the air as well as providing sachets of hand gel to passengers. Current flight service on planes does not include hot food or duty free sales. Indonesia reported 1,671 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, bringing the total count to 74,018, a health ministry official, Achmad Yurianto, told a televised news briefing, according to Reuters. Deaths from the virus rose by 66 on Saturday, bringing the total tally to 3,535, he said, while 34,719 people have recovered. The European parliament has voted to temporarily derogate certain restrictions around clinical trials of drugs containing genetically modified organisms to speed up the development of a coronavirus vaccine. MEPs on Friday used an “urgent procedure” process to adopt a new regulation to speed up the development of Covid-19 treatments and vaccines containing GMOs, which would otherwise be restricted by EU GMO directives, according to a European parliament press release. The regulation was passed by 505 votes to 67, with 109 abstentions. According to “background” cited in the statement: The commission has proposed a regulation to derogate temporarily - only for the period during which Covid-19 is a public health emergency – from certain provisions of the GMO directive for clinical trials on Covid-19 vaccines and treatments that contain or consist of GMOs. The derogation should apply only to operations necessary to conduct the clinical trial phase and for compassionate or emergency use in the context of Covid-19. The derogation will facilitate the development, authorisation and consequently availability of Covid-19 vaccines and treatments. When debated last week in the committee on the environment, public health and food safety, members agreed on the need to adapt the rules but stressed that standards for vaccine quality, safety and efficacy must be maintained. South Korea has reported 35 new cases of the coronavirus, bringing its caseload to 13,373 infections and 288 deaths, the Associated Press reports. South Korea’s centres for disease control and prevention said on Saturday that 13 of the new cases were in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, which has been at the centre of a virus resurgence since late May. Infections were also reported in other major cities, such as Daejeon and Gwangju, where patients have been linked to various places, including churches, a Buddhist temple, nursing homes and a sauna. Fifteen of the new cases were linked to international arrivals. Bill Gates has called for Covid-19 drugs and any eventual vaccine to be made available to countries and people that need them most, not to the highest bidder, saying that relying on market forces to ensure their distribution would prolong the pandemic, according to Reuters. The Microsoft tycoon said in a video released on Saturday: If we just let drugs and vaccines go to the highest bidder, instead of to the people and the places where they are most needed, we’ll have a longer, more unjust, deadlier pandemic. We need leaders to make these hard decisions about distributing based on equity, not just on market-driven factors. Gates made his money through the Microsoft software company, whose operating systems and Office software have dominated the market for decades. In recent years he has become one of the world’s biggest philanthropic givers, through his foundation becoming the largest private donor to the World Health Organization and the Gavi vaccine alliance, among other organisations. Gates’s foundation also provides funding to the Guardian’s global development desk. Speaking in the video, which was released for a virtual Covid-19 conference organised by the International Aids Society, Gates said efforts which began two decades ago to battle the global HIV/Aids crisis – when countries came together to eventually make medicines available in most of the world including Africa – could serve as a model for making Covid-19 medicines widely accessible. As examples he pointed to the 2002-created Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the US-based President’s Emergency Plan For Aids Relief to get medicines to people to combat some of the world’s deadliest diseases. “One of the best lessons in the fight against HIV/Aids is the importance of building this large, fair global distribution system to get the drugs out to everyone,” Gates said. In the US, the coronavirus pandemic has sparked a surge in RV or motorhome purchasing and rental, and enthusiastic camping and “glamping” bookings as Americans attempt to escape months of quarantine for a summer break while avoiding flights and keeping their distance, writes Miranda Bryant in New York for the Guardian US. The pandemic, which continues to rage across the US, has made many traditional holiday activities either impossible or unappealing, putting millions off flying abroad, going to crowded resort hotels, group holidays or cruises. But experts say the apparent lower risk of transmission in the open is putting outdoor holidays in demand – and attracting new fans. Camping and glamping booking services report huge spikes in business, with some being 400% busier than the same time last year, following the reopening of states for business. RV companies said business is “booming” in rental and sales. Meanwhile, the outdoors retailer REI said it has seen record growth in its camping department in the last six weeks as people rush to buy equipment. The UK government is poised to launch an emergency drive to slim down the nation and reduce the incidence of conditions such as type 2 diabetes before an expected second wave of coronavirus, writes Peter Walker, the Guardian’s political correspondent. Downing Street is planning what has been billed as a “war against obesity” after Boris Johnson needed intensive care treatment for Covid-19, which the prime minister reportedly blamed on his weight. As well as longer-term proposals to reduce the incidence of obesity, government officials are having urgent discussions about how to persuade people to lose weight in the next few months, before an anticipated resurgence in coronavirus cases in the autumn. The UK has experienced the highest death rate from coronavirus in Europe, and one potential factor may be high rates of obesity and associated lifestyle-linked conditions such as type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, which are strongly associated with worse Covid-19 outcomes. India’s coronavirus cases have passed 800,000 with the biggest spike of 27,114 cases in the past 24 hours, causing nearly a dozen states to impose a partial lockdown in high-risk areas, the Associated Press reports. The new confirmed cases took the national total to 820,916. The health ministry on Saturday also reported another 519 deaths for a total of 22,123. As reported earlier, India is now the world’s third-worst affected country by case load. A surge in infections saw the cases jumping from 600,000 to more than 800,000 in nine days. The ministry said the recovery rate was continuing to improve at more than 62%. Eight of India’s 28 states, including the worst-hit Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi, account for nearly 90% of all infections. The most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, with nearly 230 million people, imposed a weekend lockdown while several others announced restrictions in districts reporting major spikes. Metropolitan Melbourne returned to lockdown on 8 July after Victoria recorded 191 new cases of coronavirus since the start of the week, which was, at the time, the highest daily increase since the pandemic began. Guardian Australia’s Melissa Davey explains why the stage 3 stay-at-home orders were announced, how the latest lockdown has been met with a mixture of fury and acceptance, and whether this apparent second wave could have been avoided. In Bangladesh, thousands of beds for coronavirus patients are lying empty, despite a rising caseload, because people are to scared to go to hospitals, officials and patients say, according to Agence France-Presse. Some patients have told health workers they would “rather die at home than die in a hospital”, an official for a medical charity told AFP. Bangladesh has registered about 180,000 Covid-19 infections, and around 3,000 new cases are being added each day, while the death toll stood at 2,275 by Friday. But medical experts say the real figures are likely to be much higher because so little testing has been carried out. In the capital, Dhaka, about 4,750 of 6,305 beds set aside for coronavirus patients are not being used, the government’s health department acknowledged. At a new 2,000-bed field hospital built specially to care for coronavrus patients, only about 100 people are inside. Authorities in the second city of Chittagong, which has emerged as a virus hotspot, say only half of its dedicated hospital beds are currently filled. The two cities have a combined population of 25 million and account for around 80% of Bangladesh’s 87,000 active cases. The health department said the beds were not being used because many sufferers were being treated at home. Russia was fast approaching three quarters of a million coronavirus cases on Saturday, as its latest update reported 6,611 new infections, taking its nationwide tally to 720,547, according to Reuters. The country’s coronavirus crisis response centre said 188 people had died from the virus in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 11,205. So far 497,446 people have recovered from the virus. The former UK health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is spreading the message that Britons should wear face coverings in shops, in an appearance on the radio this morning. Three UK papers carried front page stories this morning suggesting that a move to make masks mandatory indoors was imminent. Hunt, chairman of the house of commons health and social care committee, called for simple government messaging. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: I’m afraid I do go all ‘nanny’ on that one. I understand the public health advice, which is that if there’s a risk of being less than two metres close to someone then you should wear it but if not you don’t have to. But it doesn’t answer the basic question which is: ‘If I’m going shopping, should I wear a face mask or not?’ And I think with public health advice in a pandemic you just need simplicity, so I would favour saying we should wear face masks in shops. Philip Alston, the outgoing special rapporteur on extreme poverty at the UN High Commission for Human Rights, has written for the Guardian on how the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed a hidden pandemic of poverty that had been masked by wishful thinking and a misleading benchmark set by the World Bank. He writes: Poverty is suddenly all over the front page. As coronavirus ravages the globe, its wholly disproportionate impact on poor people and marginalised communities is inescapable. Hundreds of millions of people are being pushed into poverty and unemployment, with woeful support in most places, alongside a huge expansion in hunger, homelessness, and dangerous work. How could the poverty narrative have turned on a dime? Until just a few months ago, many were celebrating the imminent end of poverty; now it’s everywhere. The explanation is simple. Over the past decade, world leaders, philanthropists and pundits have embraced a deceptively optimistic narrative about the world’s progress against poverty. It has been lauded as one of the “greatest human achievements”, a feat seen “never before in human history” and an “unprecedented” accomplishment. But the success story was always highly misleading. As I show in my final report as UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, almost all of these rosy accounts rely on one measure – the World Bank’s $1.90 (£1.50) a day international poverty line – which is widely misunderstood, flawed and yields a deceptively positive picture. It has generated an undue sense of satisfaction and a dangerous complacency with the status quo. Under that line, the number of people in “extreme poverty” fell from 1.9 billion in 1990 to 736 million in 2015. But the dramatic drop is only possible with a scandalously unambitious benchmark, which aims to ensure a mere miserable subsistence. The best evidence shows it doesn’t even cover the cost of food or housing in many countries. And it obscures poverty among women and those often excluded from official surveys, such as migrant workers and refugees. Much of the touted decline is due to rising incomes in a single country, China. The consequences of this highly unrealistic picture of progress against poverty have been devastating. Click through to read more - it is worth reading in full. There is no single story dominating the headlines on the newstands in the UK on Saturday morning. The Guardian reports an exclusive on a “radical and politically risky reorganisation of the NHS” which comes as the government grows increasingly frustrated at the health service’s chief executive, Simon Stevens. Denis Campbell, our health policy correspondent, writes: The prime minister has set up a taskforce to devise plans for how ministers can regain much of the direct control over the NHS they lost in 2012 under a controversial shake-up masterminded by Andrew Lansley, the then coalition government health secretary ... In the summer, the taskforce will present Johnson with a set of detailed options to achieve those goals, and that will be followed by a parliamentary bill to enact the proposals, it is understood. The Times, the Telegraph and the Independent all go with the story that the wearing of facemasks may become mandatory in shops, in the latest bid to try to curb the spread of coronavirus, which has been particularly disastrous in the UK. According to the Times: Boris Johnson is poised to make face coverings compulsory in shops after mounting evidence that they slow the spread of coronavirus. The prime minister promised last night to get “stricter” on their use and said he was “looking at ways of making sure” that more people covered their faces indoors. A government source said it was a “fair assumption” that masks would become mandatory in shops and other indoor settings within a few weeks. The Financial Times reports on a fall in UK government borrowing costs, which will come in handy for the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, given that he has had to borrow so much money for the government’s stimulus packages to ameliorate the effects of the coronavirus lockdown. Unfortunately the FT doesn’t give much away for free so you’ll have to subscribe for a taste of what it is they have found out. At the Daily Mail, interest in the coronavirus has apparently waned, and they have a Covid-19-free front page. Instead the paper reports on an alleged honours scandal. The Mail reports: A firm boasted it could win a gong for a celebrity author for £80,000, the Daily Mail reveals today. Leaked emails expose a cynical offer to help Barbara Taylor Bradford become a dame by getting direct feedback from ‘the people that matter’. The brazen messages stated: ‘Basically our fee is 80K plus VAT ... we bill half up front and half once the damehood has been awarded.’ Hundreds of applicants have used fee-paying companies to help win honours - a practice critics say devalues the entire system. The Daily Express returns to a favoured bugbear - TV licences. Their “Great TV licence revolt” story reports on the fallout from the decision to take free TV licences away from pensioners. Says the Express: MILLIONS of pensioners are threatening a revolt over the BBC’s “heartless” decision to axe free TV licences for over-75s. Furious older viewers plan to paralyse the Beeb’s system by cancelling direct debits and standing orders and paying by cheque instead. The revolt has already resulted in 40,000 messages being sent to BBC director-general Tony Hall. Now millions are being asked to bombard the Prime Minister’s Twitter account to protest at the over-75s losing the perk next month. The Mirror has a story about hunting. The US dentist who drew worldwide revulsion and fury for killing a much-loved lion is reportedly back on the prowl, killing more wild animals. “THE dentist who slayed Cecil the lion five years ago is hunting again,” according to the Mirror. Walter Palmer, 60, paid up to £80,000 to slaughter a huge ram in Mongolia. But after the outrage over the death of Cecil, the American “driller killer’s” face is hidden on photos boasting of the hunt. Humane Society International said: “Clearly the killing for kicks continues”. And the i leads on the prime minister’s demand that the plebs go back to work. “Get back to the office, says PM.” According to its story: Boris Johnson called for workers to return to the factory or office if they can in a major shift of emphasis in the Government’s coronavirus strategy. The Prime Minister said “the faster we can get back to the status quo ante the better” for industries such as hospitality, manufacturing and academia as he signalled he is keen to speed up the UK’s exit from lockdown. Official Government guidelines state everyone should “work from home if you can” and “stay at home as much as possible” in order to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Good evening, good afternoon, good morning. This is Damien Gayle in London taking you through the next few hours of coronavirus-related updates and headlines from around the world. If you have any comments, tips or suggestions, please feel free to drop me a line, either via email to damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or via Twitter direct message to @damiengayle. I will be handing the blog over to my colleagues in the UK now. Thank you for following us here in Sydney and Melbourne today. Here is a wrap of the day so far: Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration granted provisional approval for the use of the drug remdesivir in the treatment of Covid-19, making Australia one of the first countries to authorise its use for coronavirus, after regulators in Japan, Singapore and the EU. The Australian state of Victoria recorded 216 new cases of Covid-19 and one death, a man in his 90s who died in hospital. Some 186 of those cases are under investigation. Meanwhile the state of New South Wales recorded seven new cases, including one of the two confirmed cases linked to the Crossroads Hotel in Casula. Three close contacts of the man who attended the Sydney pub on 3 July have also tested positive, and their results will be reflected in Sunday’s figures for NSW. The number of daily cases in the United States hit record levels again, increasing by nearly 69,000. Serbia announced a record Covid-19 death toll for a single day on Friday, with the prime minister, Ana Brnabic, saying the Balkan state recorded 18 fatalities and 386 new cases over 24 hours in what she described as a “dramatic increase”. India is now the world’s third-worst affected country, based on data from Johns Hopkins University. The country has tallied 793,802 infections and more than 21,600 deaths, with cases doubling every three weeks. Stay safe everyone. From AFP: Conservationists have warned a sudden change in Myanmar’s law allowing the commercial farming of tigers, pangolins and other endangered species risks further fuelling demand in China for rare wildlife products. The south-east Asian nation is already a hub for the illegal trafficking of wildlife, a trade driven by demand from neighbouring China and worth an estimated $20bn worldwide. In June, Myanmar’s Forest Department quietly gave the green light to private zoos to apply for licences to breed 90 species, more than 20 of which are endangered or critically endangered. It was an unexpected move that caught conservation groups off guard but was explained by the Forest Department as a way to help reduce poaching of wild species and illegal breeding. Tigers – thought to number just 22 in Myanmar – pangolins, elephants and various vulture species as well as the critically endangered Ayeyarwady dolphin and Siamese crocodile can now also be bred for their meat and skin. But conservationists say commercial farming in the long term legitimises the use of endangered species and fuels market demand. “Commercial trade has been shown to increase illegal trade in wildlife by creating a parallel market and boosting overall demand for wild animal products,” conservation groups WWF and Fauna &amp; Flora International said in a joint statement. Experts also fear Myanmar’s lack of capacity to regulate the trade raises the risk of disease spillover to humans from animals and even the “next Covid-19”. John Goodrich from global wild cat conservation organisation Panthera warned farming can also “provide a means for laundering wild specimens”, complicating efforts to police the trade. Here is a little more on the situation in Queensland where the border has just reopened to tourists, except for Victorians. From AAP: Tourists continue to stream into Queensland as the state recorded two new cases of Covid-19. But premier Annastacia Palaszczuk says the new cases are ADF personnel who have been in isolation since returning recently from overseas. “They are not considered a risk to the public,” she said. The new cases reported on Saturday came after three days without any cases being detected in Queensland. They bring the number of active cases in Queensland to three. The Sunshine state opened its borders on Friday to interstate travellers, apart from those who have been in Victoria during the past 14 days, for the first time since 25 March. Carloads of tourists were backed up on Gold Coast roads on Saturday as police checked border passes. But the queues were far shorter than the 12km lines reported by the Australian Traffic Network on Friday. Gold Coast mayor Tom Tate welcomed the travellers, saying “without the traffic you wouldn’t have the tourism influx”. He said the average hotel occupancy was already surpassing 75 per cent in a much-needed boost for the tourism industry. “The signals are out there that the Gold Coast is open for business,” Tate said on Saturday. Police commissioner Katarina Carroll said police had intercepted 32,000 vehicles entering Queensland since 3 July and turned away 1,542 people. Queensland’s airports are also teeming with interstate arrivals keen to soak up the sun and warmer weather, with another 4,500 expected to touch down over the weekend. On Friday, there had been almost 314,000 downloads of the week-long border pass needed to enter the state. Anyone who experiences symptoms within two weeks of their arrival in Queensland must get tested or face a $4,004 fine. On that note I’m signing off from lockdown in Victoria, Australia, and handing this liveblog over to Lisa Cox in Sydney, who is still able to enjoy such pleasures as pub meals. However, Sydney and the entire state of New South Wales remain on high alert given the situation in Victoria. Some have expressed concern that as NSW returns slowly to normal, it may experience a similar situation to its neighbour state. In the meantime, the state border is closed. Two Covid-19 cases in NSW, a man and a woman, have been linked to the same Sydney pub. Three people who have had close contact with the man have also contracted coronavirus. So everyone must remain vigilant, no matter where they live. Thanks for joining me throughout our coverage so far. Stay safe. I’ve had many teachers in Victoria, Australia, contact me today saying they are concerned because they will be returning to the workplace on Monday without updated written safety procedures and guidance. The Victorian Education Department has not provided schools with the updated Operations Guide the premier committed to earlier this week. Yet the government has also told teachers they will need to implement a temperature checking regime for students when students return. So far the only guidance teachers have received about implementing this has come from their own school leadership and from the education union. I chased this up with the Victorian government today and was told by a spokesman for the education minister: “An updated operations guide will be issued to Victorian government schools imminently.” The government has had to grapple with a rise in cases, lockdown and a massively expanding testing regime in recent weeks as well as changes to the way schools will run, so it’s understandable it’s been a bit of a scramble for them to get the guidance and sign-off required to develop the guidelines. Big thanks to all of the teachers and principals throughout the state for all the work you do, and all the best for the return to school on Monday. Dr Nick Coatsworth is addressing the issue of masks in Australia, and makes the important point they are really only significantly effective when there are large amounts of community transmission. He said it would not be useful to advise people in Western Australia, for example, to wear masks, where there appears to be no community transmission. They key methods of containing Covid-19 remained hand washing and hygiene, social distancing, and staying at home when sick and getting tested. There have been many misleading statements made by some in the past couple of weeks about masks, including that they are the most effective way to prevent spread. “Masks are part of a suite of protective measures,” Coatsworth said. While it’s challenging what’s happening in Victoria at the moment ... all it took in New Zealand was one or two cases to cause a significant amount of concern in the community. We have to learn to live with Covid-19. Victorians have been advised to wear masks in situations where social distancing is not possible, but it is not an order – just guidance at this stage. He was asked about Victoria and at what point there would be so many cases the contact tracing system would become overwhelmed. This is a national response to Covid-19 so contact tracers are being mobilised nationally to assist colleagues in Victoria who have been working night and day on this ... there’s some fantastic work being done in Victoria. Australia’s deputy chief medical officer, Dr Nick Coatsworth, is holding a press conference, highlighting the 227 new cases in Australia over the past 24 hours. We know of those, the bulk – 216 – were from Victoria. Most of the rest were from returned travellers from overseas now in other states and territories and being kept in hotel quarantine. However, New South Wales also has three cases acquired in the community, close contacts of a known case. Australia-wide, 16 patients are in intensive care. Coatsworth is speaking about Australia’s drugs regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, granting provisional approval for the antiviral drug remdesivir to be used as the first treatment option for Covid-19. It has received provisional approval for use in adults and adolescent patients with severe Covid-19 symptoms in hospital. “It stops the virus from multiplying further in the body,” he said. “The important thing to note is none [of the drugs available] are a silver bullet. None of the international trials that have been conducted have shown marked results but they have shown some results that indicate remdesivir might be effective in patients with moderate to severe disease.” He said the drug seemed to be associated with a reduction in length of hospital stay due to reduction of severe adverse events. “What we don’t know yet is whether it has a conclusive effect on mortality,” he said. Australians should understand that our key defence against severe Covid 19-case was the work of it’s highly qualified intensive care nurses and doctors, Coatsworth said. It was this team, not drugs, that meant Australians should feel safe. “Remdesivir is very certainly good news but the best thing we have is skilled doctors and nurses,” he said. The current stockpile of remdesivir in Australia is enough for coming weeks in Australia, Coatsworth said. The US bought up most global supply of the drug back in June. But as I reported a couple of weeks ago, the manufacturer of the drug, Gilead, donated a significant amount of the drug to the national medical stockpile, which Coatsworth said he was confident would last for several weeks, until more supply could be secured. Thanks to one of our readers Tom, from Ukraine, who alerted me to the latest figures there. Yesterday’s coronavirus death count for Ukraine brought its weekly total to a new record. There have been 1,345 deaths overall there, and a record 118 deaths in the past week. More details on the latest figures from Victoria, Australia. Western Australia has reported two new cases of Covid-19 overnight, as well as two historical cases, bringing the state’s total to 634. The two new cases are returned overseas travellers currently in hotel quarantine. The two historical cases were based on serology – these cases were linked to cruise ship travel. In just three weeks, India went from the worlds sixth worst-affected country by the coronavirus to the third, AP reports, based on data from Johns Hopkins University. India’s fragile health system was bolstered during a stringent months-long lockdown, but could still be overwhelmed by an exponential rise in infections. India has tallied 793,802 infections and more than 21,600 deaths, with cases doubling every three weeks. It’s testing more than 250,000 samples daily after months of sluggishness, but experts say this is insufficient for a country of nearly 1.4 billion people. “This whole thing about the peak is a false bogey because we won’t have one peak in India, but a series of peaks,” said Dr Anant Bhan, a bioethics and global health researcher. He pointed out that the capital of New Delhi and India’s financial capital, Mumbai, had already seen surges, while infections had now begun spreading to smaller cities as governments eased restrictions. The actual toll would be unknown, he said, unless India made testing more accessible. From AFP: The World Health Organization has urged countries grappling with coronavirus to step up control measures, saying it is still possible to rein it in, as some nations clamp fresh restrictions on citizens. With case numbers worldwide more than doubling in the past six weeks, Uzbekistan on Friday returned to lockdown and Hong Kong said schools would close from Monday after the city recorded “exponential growth” in locally transmitted infections. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called on countries to adopt an aggressive approach, highlighting Italy, Spain, South Korea and India’s biggest slum to show it was possible to stop the spread, no matter how bad the outbreak. The health agency’s comments came as US president Donald Trump was forced to cancel an election rally in New Hampshire, citing an approaching storm. Trump has pushed to hold large gatherings against health advice as epidemiologists warn of the dangers posed by the virus moving through the air in crowded and confined spaces. On a visit to Florida on Friday, Trump hit out at Beijing over the pandemic. “(The) relationship with China has been severely damaged. They could have stopped the plague ... They didn’t stop it,” he told reporters. The virus has killed at least 556,140 people worldwide since it emerged in China last December. The US, the country worst hit by the illness, reported almost 64,000 new cases Friday and the death toll now stands at just under 134,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. Brazil, the second-hardest hit, surpassed 70,000 deaths and reported 45,000 new infections, the health ministry said. In Uzbekistan, citizens were from Friday facing lockdown restrictions again that were originally imposed in March but lifted gradually over the past two months. The central Asian country’s return to confinement followed a decision by Australia to lock down its second-biggest city Melbourne from Thursday. A French bus driver who was badly beaten by passengers after asking them to wear face masks in line with coronavirus rules has died, his family said, sparking tributes from political leaders who condemned his “cowardly” attackers. AFP reports that Philippe Monguillot, 59, was left brain dead by the attack in the southwestern town of Bayonne last weekend and died in hospital on Friday, his daughter Marie said, after his family decided to switch off his life-support system. “We decided to let him go. The doctors were in favour and we were as well,” she told AFP. Two men have been charged with attempted murder over the attack and prosecutor Jerome Bourrier told AFP that he would ask for the charges to be upgraded following Monguillot’s death. France’s prime minister Jean Castex led tributes to Monguillot. “The Republic recognises him as an exemplary citizen and will not forget him. The law will punish the perpetrators of this despicable crime,” he tweeted, describing the attack as “cowardly”. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, who was due to meet some of Bayonne’s bus drivers on Saturday and discuss the security situation, labelled it an “abhorrent act”. “The coward responsible must not go unpunished,” he added. Monguillot’s family had organised a silent march in his honour on Wednesday, departing from the bus stop where the assault took place. His colleagues refused to work after the attack but will resume work on Monday under stepped-up security arrangements, the local operator Keolis said. This will include security agents being deployed on the long buses that operate in Bayonne and its surrounding area. Three other people have been charged in connection with the attack, two for failing to assist a person in danger and another for attempting to hide a suspect, the prosecutor’s office said. The two charged with attempted murder are aged 22 and 23 and were previously known to police. Thanks to Lisa Cox for handling the blog for me while I had a little break, Melissa Davey back here with you now reporting from Melbourne. It’s just been announced that the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 378 to 198,556, according to data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases. The reported death toll rose by six to 9,060, the tally showed. Victoria has a breakdown of today’s Covid-19 numbers. The total number of cases in the state since the start of the pandemic is now 3,560. Of today’s 216 cases, 181 are new, with 35 reclassified. There are 1,249 active cases and 535 may indicate community transmission. There is still no new detail on which of the cases are linked to known outbreaks and clusters. By local government area, the areas with the highest numbers of cases are Hume (354 cases, 176 of them active), Melbourne (318 cases, 203 of them active) and Wyndham (263 cases, 175 of them active). And here is that how-to guide on masks that the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, mentioned this morning. Just a little more from that Victorian media conference earlier today. Late in the press conference, the state’s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, was asked about the current suppression approach to the pandemic and whether an elimination strategy should be considered. He said the suppression approach was a decision by national cabinet. Here are his comments: As a public health person, I’d be happy if elimination were a feasible thing to achieve because it has its challenges. You absolutely need to not reintroduce virus at any point, once you’ve eliminated it. It will take off. The challenges of suppression are very substantial as well, especially if the vaccine is 18 months or more away. I think it’s [elimination] not the national decision at the moment. I would hope that as we move through this phase in Victoria, and, look at everything occurring across the rest of Australia, that we don’t close ourselves off to a reevaluation and reappraisal of what the pros and cons are. I’m taking a short break to refill the coffee cup before I return to take you through the rest of the afternoon. In the meantime I’m handing the blog over to my colleague Lisa Cox in Sydney. To recap events so far: Australia’s drugs regulator has granted provisional approval for the drug remdesivir to be used as the first treatment option for Covid-19. Australia is the one of the first regulators to authorise the use of remdesivir for the treatment of Covid-19, following on from recent approvals in European Union, Japan, and Singapore. New cases of Covid-19 rose by nearly 69,000 across the US on Friday. Meanwhile, the US has welcomed the World Health Organization’s probe into the origins of virus. The premier of the state of Victoria, Australia, has announced 216 new cases of Covid-19 and one death as the state grapples with a second wave of the virus as the rest of the country has the virus largely contained. Two Covid-19 cases in New South Wales, Australia, a man and a woman, have been linked to the same pub. Three people who have had close contact with the man have also contracted coronavirus. Serbia announced a record Covid-19 death toll for a single day on Friday, with prime minister Ana Brnabic saying the Balkan state recorded 18 fatalities and 386 new cases over 24 hours in what she described as a “dramatic increase”. France has become the sixth country to report a death toll of more than 30,000. The World Health Organization reported a record increase in global coronavirus cases on Friday, with the total rising by 228,102 in 24 hours. In the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), no new cases of Covid-19 have been recorded in the past 24 hours, leaving the territory’s total at 113. There are five active cases in the ACT. ACT chief health officer Dr Kerryn Coleman reminded those in Canberra that given the situation in Victoria, the ACT is likely to have more cases and everybody has a responsibility to minimise their potential exposure: It’s important to acknowledge that while we are in a very strong position in the ACT that this pandemic is still ongoing. Canberrans should take appropriate steps to reduce the spread of the virus when they are out and about. That means keeping 1.5m away from others where possible, washing or sanitising their hands regularly, avoiding touching their face, and coughing or sneezing into a tissue or into the crook of their elbow. Coleman also reminded people who have been in Victoria within the past 14 days that they must notify ACT Health before returning to the ACT, and encouraged them to do so now if they hadn’t already. Non-ACT residents should not be travelling to the ACT. Those who have an exceptional need to do so must apply for an exemption. Thousands have protested for a fourth day across Serbia over the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic as officials condemned the demonstrations and announced a record jump in cases. Some demonstrators threw firecrackers and chanted nationalist slogans, according to AFP journalists. The protests were held as the Balkan nation announced a record daily death toll from Covid-19. Prime minister Ana Brnabic said on Friday the Balkan state recorded 18 fatalities and 386 new cases over 24 hours in what she described as a “dramatic increase”. At the same time, Brnabic condemned as “irresponsible” protests held in Belgrade and other cities on Thursday, after demonstrations in the capital on the previous two days had spilled over into violence. “With regard to the demonstrations, there is no more irresponsible behaviour right now,” said Brnabic. “We shall see the results of the protests in three to four days,” she said and called on people to respect measures to restrict the spread of the virus. President Aleksandar Vucic condemned the actions of demonstrators who had blocked the main road into the second-largest city of Novi Sad as “pure terrorism”, speaking on national TV: We are in this situation because of the irresponsibility of those who are calling for people to be on the streets. I am begging people not to protest because they will end up seeking medical help. Vucic also said the demonstrations were unlawful. Protesters have given vent to their frustration with Vucic, who is seen by many as having facilitated a virus second wave by lifting an initial lockdown so that elections could be held on 21 June and which his Serbian Progressive Party largely won. The first demonstration on Tuesday was triggered after Vucic announced the return of a weekend curfew to combat a second wave of coronavirus infections that has overwhelmed hospitals in Belgrade. New cases of Covid-19 rose by nearly 69,000 across the United States on Friday, according to Reuters, setting a record for the third consecutive day as Walt Disney Co. stuck to its plans to reopen its flagship theme park in hard-hit Florida. A total of eight US states - Alaska, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Montana, Ohio, Utah and Wisconsin - also reached records for single-day infections. In Texas, another hot zone, governor Greg Abbott warned he may have to impose new clampdowns if the state cannot stem its record-setting caseloads and hospital numbers through masks and social distancing. “If we don’t adopt this best practice it could lead to a shutdown of business,” the Republican governor told local KLBK-TV in Lubbock, adding it was the last thing he wanted. Readers from around the world have been contacting me quite interested in the lockdown now in place of most of Victoria, Australia, where I live. While a concerning number of cases of Covid-19 were announced in the state today, the premier Daniel Andrews began introducing lockdowns in targeted areas at the end of June when new cases were in the double-digits, before the much broader lockdown was announced last week and took effect on Thursday. Strong measures were taken long before we got to this point. But we are seeing cities around the world reporting hundreds or even thousands of new cases each day that are persevering with reopening. And while it seems most Australians support lockdowns as authorities deem necessary, elsewhere, such as in the US, the worst-affected country with more than 3.1 million diagnosed cases and at least 134,000 deaths, some people are outraged by even wearing a mask, seeing it as impacting on their freedom rather than a health protection measure. I asked Victorians how they are coping returning to lockdown for the second time as the state works to contain the spread, and as other Australian jurisdictions work to keep the virus out. Here are some of the responses: And a public service announcement: More on the two infected Covid-19 cases who went to the same pub in New South Wales, Australia. The pair were not known to each other, but visited the Crossroads Hotel on the same day, 3 July. The pub/hotel is located in Casula, about 35km south-west of the Sydney central business district and has now been closed for deep cleaning. Three new cases have been identified in household contacts of one of those infected people who went to the pub. A pop-up clinic has set up in the pub/hotel’s carpark and will be open until 4pm Saturday. NSW Health’s Dr Jeremy McAnulty said: There’s been recent community transmission of Covid-19 in NSW and so we’re at a critical point in the fight to contain the virus. Queensland, Australia, has two new overseas-acquired cases of Covid-19, bringing the total cases there since the epidemic began to 1,070. Both cases recently returned from overseas and have been in isolation since arrival. They are therefore not currently considered be a risk to the public. As of 11 July, Queensland has three active Covid-19 cases. A previous case announced on 7 July has now recovered. The chief health officer of Victoria, Australia, Prof Brett Sutton, was just asked whether Victoria has enough supply of the drug remdesivir, after Australia’s drugs regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, granted provisional approval overnight for the drug to be used as the first treatment option for Covid-19. It can now be used in adults and adolescent patients with severe Covid-19 symptoms in hospital in Australia. But in June the US bought up virtually all the stocks of the drug for the next three months, leaving none for most of the rest of the world. “The US really went very hard in gobbling up the entire global supply almost,” Sutton said. I looked into how this would affect Australian supply a couple of weeks ago. The Australian government told me US pharmaceutical giant Gilead has donated a supply of remdesivir to Australia’s national medical stockpile. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, told me there will be enough of the drug to meet Covid-19 patient demand. A spokesman for Hunt told me: The Australian government has received from Gilead a donated supply of remdesivir to the national medical stockpile, which will be available for use in eligible patients prescribed by a medical practitioner. Australia currently has sufficient supply of remdesivir to meet current patient needs on the basis of our expert medical advice. However given the ongoing rise in Victorian cases this will be worth keeping an eye on over coming weeks. World Health Organization director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has launched the ‘Access Initiative for Quitting Tobacco,’ which aims to help the world’s 1.3bn tobacco users quit during the pandemic. Smoking kills eight million people a year, but if users need more motivation to kick the habit, the pandemic provides the right incentive. Evidence reveals that smokers are more vulnerable than non-smokers to developing a severe case of Covid-19. In the past 12 hours the world recorded 12m Covid-19 cases, he said. In the last six weeks cases have more than doubled. The chief health officer of Victoria, Australia, Prof Brett Sutton, has just said it is getting harder to quickly identify which new cases are linked with known outbreaks, and which are new clusters. He said there have been “single cases with staff members in aged care facilities”. However, unlike aged care outbreaks in other states, which saw the virus spread within homes with tragic repercussions for elderly residents, Victoria has so far managed to contain the virus within those aged care homes. That’s the workforce that we have to be really mindful of. The response in each and every aged care facility is to going to lockdown for those residents and all staff to be tested and for them to go into a quarantine period of 14 days and to have that testing before that quarantine is lifted for all residents and staff members. But it flags the dangers in aged care facilities. Victoria had more outbreaks there than any jurisdiction, but we haven’t had an aged care facility that has had a substantial outbreak. I think that’s in large part because we had the early robust response in terms of testing everyone and going into lockdown. Meanwhile premier Daniel Andrews won’t be drawn into debates about whether his state or the federal government should have done, or should be doing, more: If I need something, I ring the prime minister, the answer is ‘yes’. That’s how it works. If he needs something from me, that’s the same thing, that how it works, that’s the nature of our partnership. As Victoria, Australia, has just announced new cases in the hundreds, the state’s health minister Jenny Mikakos has moved to reassure people that the health system is prepared for the ongoing struggle to contain the virus. The virus is largely contained in other Australian jurisdictions, where most new cases, when there are any, are from returned travellers from overseas who go straight into mandatory hotel quarantine. With 216 new cases confirmed in Victoria overnight, all due to community transmission, Mikakos said: “As a government we have never hesitated to put in the resources that are needed to support our efforts in this pandemic.” “Our hospitals are well prepared,” she said. They have been working since January to respond to this pandemic. Even when the numbers came down, they never paused in their efforts. They are well-resourced and well trained to respond. We have ventilators in our warehouse. We have medical equipment in our warehouse and being distributed to our health services all the time, and personal protective equipment ... 32m masks are sitting in our warehouse as we speak. I take this opportunity to reassure the community that our hospitals remain safe for them to visit. They should not hesitate to present to our emergency departments if they need that support or to call for an ambulance... Please do not put off your regular [health] screenings. If you get contacted by one of our cancer services for your biannual, regular checkup, please continue to take up those opportunities. It’s very important people do not defer medical treatment. Just to reiterate, it is permissible to leave your home to seek medical care or healthcare, and that includes to present for testing for coronavirus. The premier of the state of Victoria, Australia, has announced 216 new cases of Covid-19 and one death as the state grapples with a second wave of the virus as the rest of the country has the virus largely contained. The man who died in hospital was in his 90s. Premier Daniel Andrews just told reporters: This is not an ordinary weekend. It is anything but that. You’ve got to be in your home if you are in the metropolitan Melbourne or Mitchell Shire areas, and only for those four reasons. Those reasons are for healthcare and other essential services like groceries, exercise, work and study [if they can’t be done fro home], or childcare. It comes as the state of New South Wales closed its border with Victoria last week for the first time in a century in a bid to contain the virus. Other measures taken in the past few days to stop the spread beyond Victoria have included placing a cap the number of incoming flights allowed in Australia. The change means at least 4,000 fewer Australians will return home each week. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, acknowledged the change meant “it will be more difficult” for Australians to return home. States and territories will also begin charging Australians for their mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine when they do return. Seven new cases of Covid-19 were diagnosed in the Australian state of New South Wales overnight, bringing the total number of cases there since the pandemic began to 3,285. Of the new cases, five are returned travellers in hotel quarantine. The other two cases are the man who visited Casula’s Crossroads Hotel on 3 July and the traveller from Melbourne reported on earlier in this blog. NSW Health is urging anyone who visited the Crossroads Hotel, Casula on the evening of Friday 3 July to immediately self-isolate, come forward for testing and monitor for symptoms. A pop-up clinic has been operational in the carpark of the hotel from 5pm last night and is opened today until 4pm. Extended-hours testing is also available at Liverpool, Campbelltown and Fairfield Hospitals at these locations: https://www.swslhd.health.nsw.gov.au/mediacentre/coronavirus/clinic_factsheet.pdf. Testing is also available through GP clinics. From Reuters: Healthcare systems worldwide need to upgrade to control disease transmission and cope with large numbers of sick people during the coronavirus pandemic as well as future outbreaks, the head of the World Health Organisation’s emergencies program has warned. Dr Michael Ryan, speaking during a video panel session organised by the International AIDS Society, said world leaders grappling with the current pandemic “need to take a leaf out of the HIV/AIDS activist book” and make sure access to healthcare is equitable and evidence-based. The coronavirus pandemic, which has not yet peaked in many parts of the world, has exposed weaknesses and left billions of people without reliable and affordable access to essential health services, he said. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS, was often a fatal infection when it emerged in the 1980s, but today is considered manageable with antiretroviral drugs. There is no vaccine to protect against HIV, which is highly variable and cannot be eliminated by the body’s own immune response. But researchers do expect to eventually have vaccines effective against the novel coronavirus, which people can recover from on their own. The WHO official said the two viruses are “different in scope and nature, but are comparable in so many other ways”, exposing the same inequities and generating similar injustices and denial. “We cannot become distracted with retrospection and finger-pointing ... We need to look ahead,” Ryan said. Queensland, Australia, has two new cases of Covid-19 as authorities engage in a balancing act, trying to let hordes of visitors into the newly reopened state while keeping Covid-19 out. The new confirmed cases were people returning from overseas, according to premier Annastacia Palaszczuk. This brings the number of active cases in Queensland to three. The latest cases come as the Sunshine State opened its borders on Friday to interstate travellers, except those from Victoria, for the first time since March 25. It meant carloads of tourists were bumper to bumper as police scanned thousands of border passes on the Gold Coast. Authorities are taking an educational rather than an enforcement approach at border checkpoints, Gold Coast chief superintendent Mark Wheeler said. “We’re trying to balance the need to get people into Queensland, but also to keep Covid-19 out of Queensland,” he said. But anyone travelling from Victoria, which recorded a record number of new cases on Friday, must prove they left the state more than two weeks ago. Wheeler said a Victorian caravanner who had been in NSW for three weeks could use an accommodation receipt as proof. Queensland’s airports are also teeming with interstate arrivals keen to soak up the sun and warmer weather, with another 4500 expected to touch down on the weekend. On Friday there had been almost 314,000 downloads of the week-long border pass that is needed to enter the state. Anyone who experiences symptoms within two weeks of their arrival in Queensland must get tested or face a AUS$4004 fine. US ambassador to the United Nations, Andrew Bremberg, has told reporters in Geneva that he welcomes the World Health Organization’s probe into the origins of the novel coronavirus in China. “We view the scientific investigation as a necessary step to having a complete and transparent understanding of how this virus has spread throughout the world,” Bremberg said. AFP reports that it was an unexpected endorsement, given that the World Health Organization has faced fierce US criticism over its handling of the coronavirus crisis. On Friday, an epidemiologist and an animal health specialist from the World Health Organization left for China to try and identify the animal source of the new coronavirus pandemic as part of a team in Beijing for the weekend as they lay the groundwork for a wider mission aimed at identifying how the virus jumped from animal to humans. Mexico’s health ministry on Friday reported 6,891 new confirmed Covid-19 infections and 665 additional deaths, bringing the total in the country to 289,174 cases and 34,191 deaths. The government has said the real number of infected people is likely significantly higher than the confirmed cases. Guardian reporter Eleanor Ainge Roy writes that the former prime minister of New Zealand Helen Clark has been told a vaccine for Covid-19 may be years away; This isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. I am told by informed sources in Geneva that it will be at least two-and-a-half years until there could be a widely available vaccine – at least. That’s not very encouraging really. I’ve made it clear in accepting it that it will be virtual for the foreseeable future – which could be quite a long time.” Clark sat down with WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in Geneva in mid-February. She said he felt “helpless” to stop the pandemic. I think when we replay the record, most of the world sort of sat by and watched with almost a sense of detachment and bemusement. China was locking down Wuhan and Beijing and thinking back to January and early February it was kind of like that’s happening over there. Dr Tedros said to me, ‘There is a very narrow window to avoid a pandemic – but it’s closing fast’. And he said ‘I don’t know what else I can do – I am screaming every day but no one is listening’. That really chills me … this is the health nuclear accident.” My colleague Christopher Knaus has written about how Australian mining magnate Andrew Forrest used his Chinese connections to help secure a remarkable quantity of diagnostic equipment for Australia. But problems soon emerged, Knaus writes; The tests were to be used by public health units, who would use them throughout 2020. The tests and associated platforms would also be deployed in 11 private pathology laboratories. The uptake, certainly among public health pathology, was patchy at best. Watching on in shock was the rest of Australia’s diagnostics industry. Not long before the announcement, Pathology Technology Australia, the peak body, handed the government an audit of Australia’s existing testing technology to conduct the kind of nucleic acid testing used for Covid-19 detection. “We had determined there was more than enough technology already in the field to significantly ramp up testing,” Dean Whiting, the PTA chief executive, said. The introduction of BGI tests brought in a new technology mid-pandemic, without any real sense of how it would fit into Australia’s existing laboratory structures. Experts warned the busiest pathology providers simply would not be able to use the devices. Read more about the saga here: Texas governor Greg Abbott has warned residents of the US state that “the worst is yet to come” after a week that saw new coronavirus diagnoses exceed 10,000 new cases per day on Tuesday and total people in hospital with the virus surpass 10,000 on Friday. The governor who oversaw one of the US’s fastest attempts to reopen is now urging residents to wear masks and warning that he might impose a new lockdown. “Things will get worse,” Abbott told a local television station. “The worst is yet to come as we work our way through that massive increase in people testing positive.” The premier of Victoria, Australia, Daniel Andrews, will hold a press conference at 11am AEST as the state grapples a second-wave of Covid-19. A record new 288 new cases were reported in the state on Friday – the single highest daily rise in any Australian jurisdiction since the pandemic began. Andrews warned that those numbers were likely to increase in the coming days. They are particularly concerning given all were acquired in the community, rather than being cases in travellers returned from overseas. Australia’s drugs regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration [TGA], has granted provisional approval for the drug remdesivir to be used as the first treatment option for Covid-19. It has received provisional approval for use in adults and adolescent patients with severe Covid-19 symptoms in hospital. “Remdesivir is the most promising treatment option so far to reduce hospitalisation time for those suffering from severe coronavirus infections,” the TGA said. “Remdesivir offers the potential to reduce the strain on Australia’s health care system. By reducing recovery times patients will be able to leave hospital earlier, freeing beds for those in need. Remdesivir will not be available to Australians unless they are severely unwell, requiring oxygen or high level support to breathe, and in hospital care.” While this is a major milestone in Australia’s struggle against the pandemic, it is important to emphasise that the product has not been shown to prevent coronavirus infection or relieve milder cases of infection. Australia is the one of the first regulators to authorise the use of remdesivir for the treatment of Covid-19, following on from recent approvals in European Union, Japan, and Singapore. Provisional approval, which is limited to a maximum of six years, was made on the basis of preliminary clinical data, as there is the potential for substantial benefit to Australian patients. The manufacturer of the drug, pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences Pty Ltd, may apply for full registration when additional clinical data -- required by the TGA to confirm the safety and efficacy of the medicine - are available. Coronavirus cases are rising across the US, some regional hospitals are filling up and some of America’s most populous places are seeing record deaths as the pandemic surges. At the same time, as some states reverse reopening plans, public health interventions such as encouraging people to wear public face coverings and closing schools have become increasingly politicised and divisive. Sunbelt states such as Arizona, Florida and Texas have been especially hard-hit after pushing to reopen their economies earlier in the pandemic. Cases a day have nearly doubled in Florida, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. More than 40 hospitals across the state maxed out their intensive care unit capacity, NBC News reported. “We’re putting ourselves at risk and other people aren’t willing to do anything and in fact go the other way and be aggressive to promote the disease,” Dr Andrew Pastewski, said. There are now 47 people in hospital in Victoria, including 12 in intensive care as the state announced a record 288 new cases Friday. The vast majority of those cases have now been locally acquired. By comparison, New South Wales reported just 14 new cases on Friday, with 12 of those in returned travellers now in hotel quarantine. A newly diagnosed man was at the Crossroads Hotel in Casula while he may have been infected, authorities say. It’s concerning because another recently confirmed New South Wales case -- a woman from South Western Sydney -- also visited the Crossroads Hotel on the same day, 3 July, though the two people aren’t known to each other. The Hotel has been closed for deep cleaning while contacts are traced. New South Wales chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant is urging anyone who visited the Crossroads Hotel on the evening of 3 July to self-isolate, monitor for symptoms and come forward for testing should they develop even the mildest of symptoms. Meanwhile, another newly confirmed New South Wales case is in a traveller from Victoria. The man drove from Melbourne and entered the state on 7 July, and has reported minimal contact with anyone in New South Wales apart from his partner and two friends. The man subsequently tested positive and is in hotel isolation and the three contacts are in quarantine. His partner has tested negative. Chant urged the community to be extra vigilant at this critical point following the closure of the Victorian/ New South Wales border on Wednesday. The border will remain shut for at least six weeks as part of an effort to stop the virus spreading to other states. Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the latest Covid-19 news from around the world. Here is a summary of the latest events over the last 24 hours or so; The majority of Victorians are waking up this morning to their first weekend back in lockdown, which came into effect on Thursday. Bordering states -- especially New South Wales – are on high alert after the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, announced a record new 288 cases on Friday – the single highest daily rise in any state since the pandemic began. He warned those numbers would increase in the coming days. By comparison, New South Wales reported 14 new cases on Friday, with 12 of those in returned travellers now in hotel quarantine. The state remains on high alert following the closure of the New South Wales/ Victoria border last week. They don’t want spread into the state, after a traveller from Victoria entered New South Wales on 7 July, and subsequently tested positive. He is now in hotel isolation. Australians will now have to cover the costs of their own two-week compulsory hotel quarantine if they return from overseas. The national cabinet decided to cap the number of incoming flights allowed in Australia. The change means at least 4,000 fewer Australians will return home each week. One of the worst Covid-19 outbreaks in the US has created a humanitarian crisis at San Quentin state prison, where almost 1,500 people have tested positive for Covid-19 and seven have died. Guardian reporter Abené Clayton has written about the crisis here, and California has announced a plan to release up to 8,000 people from the state’s prisons. Serbia announced a record Covid-19 death toll for a single day on Friday, with prime minister Ana Brnabic saying the Balkan state recorded 18 fatalities and 386 new cases over 24 hours in what she described as a “dramatic increase. France has become the sixth country to report a death toll of more than 30,000. The World Health Organization reported a record increase in global coronavirus cases on Friday, with the total rising by 228,102 in 24 hours. Melissa Davey here with you in Melbourne, Victoria, to take you through the morning from lockdown.

4,article,food/2020/jun/13/pour-thing-what-different-soy-sauces-are-used-for-and-which-to-buy,Food,2020-06-12,"Pour thing: what different soy sauces are used for, and which to buy",https://gu.com/p/e3jg9,Lifestyle,"Pour thing: what different soy sauces are used for, and which to buy","<p>If you’ve ever cooked Asian food and had the result go horribly wrong, you can probably blame your choice of soy sauce. But a little knowledge goes a long way</p>",1391,"During the Han dynasty, more than 2,000 years ago, there was a great division: what had been a singular fermented condiment made of fish and soy, used to stretch out that precious commodity salt, became two. One emerged as fish sauce and the other, soy sauce. From there they diverged dramatically according to culture, religion, demography and geography. The Buddhists, with their vegetarian practice, took soy sauce to East Asia. The Chinese merchants, who went on to sell their wares in the south, took both fish sauce and soy sauce with them – because they could, and so they did. This is a simplistic explanation of how south-east Asian cuisine tended to be dominated by the use of fish sauce, and soy sauce became more commonly used in naturalised versions of Chinese-influenced dishes, such as five-spice stewed pork, known variously as adobo, pah lo, tau yew bak, babi kecap and thįt kho tàu. In the east, soy sauce became another thing entirely. The production of soy-based products are unique to each geographical location – like miso in Japan and doenjang in Korea. Whether you call it shōyu or sii ew or just old faithful soy sauce, we are referring to a condiment that’s soybean-based. And that is where the similarity ends. How often do you see a recipe that calls for soy sauce and mindlessly reach for the Kikkoman – likely koikuchi, the darker brew? It’s understandable if you do – it is possibly the most accessible soy sauce brand worldwide. But keep in mind that all soy sauces are not the same, and if you use the wrong one, you’ll end up with a dish that’s something entirely different from what’s intended in the recipe. The variables include the production process (natural fermentation or by hydrolysis?); which Aspergillus mold it was inoculated with (A. oryzae, A. sojae, A. tamari and A. wentii are the most common); the presence of wheat or another grain; the ageing process; the ratio of the ingredients; and the presence of other preservatives. I have a whole section in my dry cupboard that is just for soy sauce. Sometimes when I’m feeling loose, I just mix it up and always inevitably kick myself at the end result. If I’m cooking a Japanese-inspired dish like goma-ae and use a light Chinese soy sauce, it’s off, and vice versa. It’s not about authenticity, I am more concerned with flavour. This is why you need to understand where the geographical and cultural inspiration of a dish comes from. For instance, if you are making pad see ew, you need to have a Thai-style dark, sweet soy. No two ways about it, you cannot make this dish with Kikkoman. All right, let’s break it down a bit. Japanese shōyu Koikuchi: the dark brew most generally used in everyday cooking. Tamari: literally the crema of miso production, it is the liquid byproduct of miso making and perhaps the closest in method and flavour to the original soy sauce of China, predominantly wheat-free, used for dipping and cooking. Usukuichi: this one has a shorter brew period that results in a lighter and saltier brew favoured by the Kansai region; often amazake is added. My chef friend Shinobu Namae patiently explained to me that the differences are more to do with the types of fish that were common to each region. Tokyo Bay used to harbour more blue fish species such as mackerel, sardines and tuna, so required a darker soy sauce like koikuchi, while the more common fish in the Kyoto area tended to be white fish such as sea bream, tilefish and pike conger – hence a lighter brew emerged. Context is everything. Chinese soy sauces Light soy: a thinner, lighter style. The main components are soy and wheat that is steamed, inoculated with A. oryzae and left to ferment in wet brine. This is most commonly used for seasoning and dipping. There are varying grades of light soy, as there are varying quality of olive oils. The first press is referred to as premium soy sauce. Dark soy sauce: yìn yóu, now produced mostly in Taiwan, is the one called for in red cooking dishes (a slow braising method that imparts a red/brown hue to the final dish). The difference here is the inclusion of rock salt and a longer fermentation period. Blended soy/dark sweet soy/thick soy: can have inclusions of molasses, starches, colour, MSG, mushrooms and even dry spices; used for longer cooking methods and also as a component to dipping sauces. South-east Asian soy sauces Much of south-east Asian cookery that uses soy sauce is based on its Chinese counterparts – the production of soy sauces in these regions have grown into a large industry, mainly passed down from the Chinese diaspora. A popular brand for light soy sauce is Golden Mountain, which is much lighter than the Chinese version. It has many more additive inclusions and is a ubiquitous seasoning that takes pride of place next to fish sauce in most pantries. The one defining difference between much of the dark soy sauce in this region is the use of palm sugar molasses, in place of cane, as the sweetening agent – though those older traditions are now being lost, as sugar is a cheaper commodity. Now it is coming back full circle and currently dark sweet soy is only differentiated by the degrees of sweetness and additives. The spinoff from the Chinese dark soy has many incarnations, namely siew dtam, kecap manis and kicap lemak. As a side note, while seasoning sauce like Maggi enjoys worldwide popularity, it is not considered a soy sauce as it does not actually contain soybeans. Instead, it is a product of hydrolysed vegetable protein and additives. When shopping for soy sauces my tips are: Look for sauces in glass bottles: there is a myriad of reasons for this, but the main one is no leaching of plastics into your food. Read the ingredients label: preservatives, N-numbers, MSG, colouring and GMO-inclusions are a no-go for me, but that is completely up to you. Pick smaller sizes: soy sauce oxidises from the moment you open it, so unless you go through loads, buy smaller or keep it in the fridge upon opening. Brands to look out for Here are some of my tried and true soy sauces. They will see you through most of Asia’s expansive cuisines. Pearl River Premium Soy Sauce This has no additives and is fermented naturally in the sun. It has a delicious full flavour without being overly salty. I use this for lighter, brothy soups, stir-fries, egg dishes and marinades. Yamaki Jozo Organic Japanese Shōyu and Tamari Koikuchi-style, this is an elegant light style that is a great option for Japanese and Korean cooking and seasoning. Healthy Boy Brand Orange Label Black Soy Sauce This is a rare dark soy on the market that does not not contain preservatives and unnecessary additives, which is why I stock it at my grocery store Jarenchai in Sydney. It has molasses, soy, wheat and salt only. I’ve found this is a good alternative to use in place of kecap manis and kicap lemak. Good for long stewing, stir-fry dishes like pad see ew. But be warned: it is sweet, so start off gently. Braggs Aminos I have put this in as an alternative product for those who have wheat intolerances and allergies. It is close in flavour and style to light soy, and can be used as a substitute well enough to season with. The thing with soy sauce is, it aides and abets the dishes it is used in to draw out and enhance complex flavours. As with everything in cooking, it is about timing – as rule of thumb for quick cooking such as stir-frying, add it towards the end. For slow cooking like stews and soups, add a little at a time throughout the process to layer, and keep tasting. For salad dressing, taste and balance continually – my ratio is usually one part soy to three parts other stuff. Of all the condiments I cook with, soy sauce fazes me most – because ethnicity and origin has so much to do with it. Sometimes I wonder if those who are peeved-off about culinary cultural appropriation are actually just put off by the fact that people don’t know how to use the appropriate soy sauce for the appropriate dish.",https://media.guim.co.uk/11654346c32fb5c8711584a455e4d9af573e2f86/0_11_5760_3456/500.jpg,0.1348176129426129

If you bought a FTSE 100 index tracker fund on 23 March, which we can now call the bottom of the market for the first stage of the Covid-19 crisis, you’ve made a 27% gain in 11 weeks. Other markets, especially the US, have done even better. And, if you were really cute, brave or lucky, you could have made truly spectacular profits by betting on the most battered stocks – easyJet up 60% in a month, for instance. Perspective is needed, naturally. The FTSE 100, at 6336, is still 1,000 points lower than it was at the end of February. But the point remains: this market rally has been extreme. Can it last? Anything’s possible, of course. The V-shaped rebound thesis is being reheated in some quarters as economies reopen. It is conceivable (just) that a coronavirus vaccine could be available by the end of this year or early 2021. And, if we’ve learned anything in the last few weeks, it’s that today’s central bankers are pumped-up versions of their predecessors in the 2008 banking crisis. Money floodgates have been opened to near-maximum; some of the cash was bound to slosh up in stock markets when interest rates are near-zero. Listen, though, to a wise old head – Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of Boston-based fund manager GMO, who has successfully steered a way through most big market events of recent decades. He expressed the disconnect between the stock market and the economy in striking terms in a letter to investors last week: “We are in the top 10% of historical price earnings ratio for the S&amp;P [the broadly-based US index] on prior earnings, and simultaneously are in the worst 10% of economic situations, arguably even the worst 1%!” Such statistics are hard to ignore, especially when you add Grantham’s key point that uncertainty “in some ways seems the highest in my experience”. He’s talking about the properly big stuff where the virus could finally force real change: “deficiencies in capitalism; inequality; climate change and our environment”, and so on. If that seems too hazy, try deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe’s gritty reminder in a speech on Tuesday that the Bank of England’s analysis last month indicated banks could face credit losses of up to £80bn in the next two years. “The Covid crisis is far from over,” said Cunliffe, a statement that only needed to be made because financial markets are giving the opposite impression. “Future news about the health crisis and consequent policy measures, or about geopolitical tension, could well spark another very sharp repricing of economic prospects and financial assets,” Cunliffe added, spelling it out. Grantham’s take feels correct: “The current market seems lost in one-sided optimism when prudence and patience seem much more appropriate.” There are never any certainties with markets, but this rally looks a case of too much, too soon. Bellway pays its way Here’s an unusual sight: a major housebuilder that declines to grab a government handout. Bellway has not accessed the government’s coronavirus job retention scheme, despite being eligible to do so and despite furloughing most of its 3,000 employees during April and May. Instead, it paid full basic salaries itself. “Housebuilders have benefitted from schemes like Help to Buy,” says chief executive Jason Honeyman. “It seems a bit disingenuous if we now need government support to help with our wages.” He’s not ruling out possibly accessing the scheme in future, but there are “no current plans to claim”. Good stuff. Chancellor Rishi Sunak, as he counts the huge cost of the furlough scheme, should take note. The job retention scheme was necessarily introduced in a hurry and was designed with broad parameters. Some beneficiaries – such as some of Bellway’s rivals – will turn out not to have needed help. There must be a way to prod and cajole to get a few quid back for the public purse.",https://media.guim.co.uk/f9b7402c50ca2c47f57cce47e632e81b19d16839/0_0_3500_2101/500.jpg,0.11696009389671362
6,article,us-news/2020/jun/04/monsanto-herbicide-court-overrules-epa,US news,2020-06-04,Court overturns EPA approval of popular herbicide made by Monsanto,https://gu.com/p/e24xx,News,Court overturns EPA approval of popular herbicide made by Monsanto,<p>Ruling says EPA ignored clear evidence that the new herbicide would cause widespread damage to crops</p>,700,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) broke the law in approving agricultural weedkilling products sold by Bayer and two other chemical giants, ignoring clear evidence that the new herbicides would cause widespread damage to crops, a federal court ruled on Wednesday. The decision by the US court of appeals for the ninth circuit invalidates the registrations for dicamba-based herbicides made by Monsanto, which is owned by Bayer AG, BASF and Corteva Agrisciences that are designed to be sprayed on genetically engineered soybeans and cotton. The court order effectively makes it illegal for farmers to continue to use the dicamba herbicides this summer as they tend to millions of acres of crops. In a stinging rebuke, the court said it had no choice but to cancel the EPA’s approval of the herbicides because the agency had strayed so far from its duty to properly assess the dangers presented by the “new use” of dicamba. “The EPA made multiple errors in granting the conditional registrations,” the court said. The petition seeking to overturn the EPA’s approval was brought by the National Family Farm Coalition, Center for Food Safety, Center for Biological Diversity and Pesticide Action Network North America. “Today’s decision is a massive win for farmers and the environment,” said George Kimbrell of the Center for Food Safety, lead counsel in the case. “It is good to be reminded that corporations like Monsanto and the Trump administration cannot escape the rule of law, particularly at a time of crisis like this. Their day of reckoning has arrived.” An EPA spokesman said the agency was currently reviewing the court decision and “will move promptly to address the court’s directive”. The issue at the heart of the court case is a crop and chemical system designed by Monsanto, which was acquired by Bayer in 2018. The company said that soybean and cotton farmers could plant “dicamba-tolerant” versions of the crops and then spray new types of dicamba herbicides directly over the top of their fields to easily kill weeds. Previously, farmers used dicamba sparingly and were largely restricted from using dicamba during the growing season because the chemical can easily drift long distances, killing or injuring a wide array of crops and other plants it settles on. Monsanto, BASF and Corteva Agriscience told the EPA that their herbicides would have low volatility and if farmers followed instructions on the product labels, they could prevent drift. But since the introduction of the new dicamba crops and herbicides, farmer complaints have been filed with state agricultural officials, reporting dicamba damage across several million acres in at least a dozen states. The Guardian reported in March that Monsanto predicted its dicamba crop system would lead to thousands of damage claims from US farmers but pushed ahead anyway, and risks were downplayed to the EPA. The court found that the EPA “refused to estimate the amount of dicamba damage”, failed to acknowledge that restrictions it placed on the use of the dicamba herbicides would not be followed, and did not acknowledge evidence that the new use of dicamba herbicides would “tear the social fabric of farming communities”. The court said it knew its decision could be costly for farmers who planned to use dicamba on their GMO soybeans and cotton fields, but said the EPA’s failure to acknowledge and address risks to other crops left the court no choice. “We acknowledge the difficulties these growers may have in finding effective and legal herbicides to protect their (dicamba-tolerant) crops …” the ruling states. “They have been placed in this situation through no fault of their own.” Bayer, BASF and Corteva each issued statements saying their herbicides were important farmer tools that could be used safely and they disagreed with the court’s decision. The companies said they were assessing options in response. “If the ruling stands, we will work quickly to minimize any impact on our customers this season,” Bayer said. BASF called the court order “unprecedented” and said it “has the potential to be devastating to tens of thousands of farmers”. Farmers could lose “significant revenue” if they are not able to kill weeds in their soybean and cotton fields with the dicamba herbicides, the company said. “We will use all legal remedies available to challenge this order,” BASF said.",https://media.guim.co.uk/b7ae415c6a4e9a2ae3f3e252ea27af69c968aef7/0_212_2167_1301/500.jpg,0.10417197181903065

As farmers prepare to plant a new season of key American food crops, farmer and consumer groups are asking the ninth circuit court of appeals in San Francisco to review and overturn the EPA’s approval of a Monsanto herbicide made with a chemical called dicamba. The allegations are from the National Family Farm Coalition, which represents tens of thousands of farmers across the US, and three non-profit consumer and environmental groups. They have been granted an expedited review of their legal petition and hope for a ruling that would block use of the herbicide this summer. The court hearing, which is to be handled by phone due to the coronavirus closing of California courthouses, comes just a month after the office of inspector general for the EPA said it would open an investigation into the agency’s handling of dicamba herbicides. Farmers have reported dicamba damage in both organic and conventional crops, including non-GMO soybeans, wheat, grapes, melons, vegetables and tobacco. A Missouri peach farmer won a $265m verdict in February against Monsanto and German chemical giant BASF after accusing the companies of creating a “defective” crop system that damaged 30,000 peach trees. The Guardian reported last month that internal Monsanto documents obtained through the peach farmer litigation revealed that Monsanto predicted its dicamba crop system would lead to thousands of damage claims from US farmers but pushed ahead anyway, trying to downplay the risks to the EPA. “You’ve had millions of acres impacted,” said George Kimbrell, a lawyer with the Center for Food Safety, which is one of the environmental groups seeking court review of the EPA, alongside the Center for Biological Diversity and Pesticide Action Network. Kimbrell said: “They decided to make farmers part of an ongoing experiment. The dicamba problem is unprecedented.” EPA approval The crop system in question was developed by Monsanto with help from BASF to encourage farmers to buy dicamba herbicides and spray them over the top of new genetically engineered soybean and cotton crops developed by Monsanto to tolerate dicamba. The altered crops survive dicamba spray but weeds die, making it easier for farmers to eradicate weeds resistant to other herbicides such as Monsanto’s glyphosate. Before the introduction of Monsanto’s dicamba-tolerant cotton in 2015 and soybeans in 2016, farmers were largely restricted from using dicamba during the growing season because the chemical can easily drift and vaporize, traveling long distances from where it is sprayed. But the release of the new dicamba-tolerant crops upended that restraint and the EPA subsequently approved “new use” dicamba products sold by Monsanto, BASF and Corteva Agriscience for treating fields planted with the genetically engineered cotton and soybeans. The companies said their herbicides would have low volatility and if farmers followed instructions on the product labels, they could prevent drift. But since the introduction of the new dicamba-tolerant soybeans and cotton, drift and volatilization has killed or injured a variety of crops, fruit trees and other plants across several millions acres. Costs to farmers The consumer and environmental groups claim the EPA violated federal law by failing to analyze the “significant socioeconomic and agronomic costs to farmers” and not relying on adequate data in its approvals of the herbicides. The damage over the last few summer seasons has been “catastrophic” they claim. The groups cite government documents they say show that the EPA itself has downplayed or ignored warnings from state agricultural officials and farmer pleas for protection from dicamba drift. Instead the agency has worked closely with Monsanto to keep the company’s dicamba herbicide, called XtendiMax, on the market, they say. Documents filed in court show Monsanto met multiple times with EPA officials about the concerns, even editing EPA language about certain steps Monsanto should take in communications with retailers. In an October 2017 email, an EPA official forwarded a Monsanto official comments from the agency regarding the company’s product label, writing: “Like I said, no surprises.” While the EPA worked with Monsanto, the records show the agency was well aware of the extent of crop damage being reported to multiple states. In a June 2018 email an Arkansas bee keeper said dicamba had caused a 50% reduction in his honey production, and a July 2018 email from a Kansas Department of Agriculture supervisor told the EPA the department had been “overrun with dicamba complaints”. Monsanto, which was bought by Bayer AG in 2018, said the claims raised by the farm coalition and other petitioners are “baseless” and the company “stands fully behind” its product. “We believe the extensive body of science supporting the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s registration decision will ultimately determine the outcome,” said Bayer spokesman Chris Loder. Monsanto has filed as an intervenor in the case. For its part, BASF said dicamba herbicides are “critically important tools for growers” and said the company is providing training to dicamba applicators and is working with academics and state and federal agencies to address concerns. Corteva declined to comment. Despite the outcry over dicamba damage, in November 2018 the EPA granted a two-year extension for the dicamba herbicides for use over the dicamba-tolerant cotton and soybeans. That registration expires on 20 December and the agency is currently considering whether or not to further extend approval. In the meantime, the EPA said it was working with states and with the companies selling the dicamba herbicides to “better understand the issue” to enable it to deal with “the problem of illegal drift”. The EPA also insists that it is not certain what is causing the crop damage. “The underlying causes of the various damage incidents are not yet clear, as ongoing investigations have yet to be concluded,” the agency told the Guardian.

Not a classic ... That’s it for bumper FA Cup clockwatch. I’ll leave you with a few match reports from around the country. Thanks for your company, emails and calm-inducing observations on VAR. Goodnight! The full-time scores in the 5.31pm games Bournemouth 4-0 Luton Fleetwood 1-2 Portsmouth Leicester City 2-0 Wigan Athletic Manchester City 4-1 Port Vale Wolves 0-0 Manchester United Brendan Rodgers maintains his perfect record in the FA Cup third round. Portsmouth hang on to reach the last 32. A comfortable evening for Eddie Howe. Life is precious, dear friend, and if you watched that game you have just wasted two hours of it. A predictably easy victory for City. But the real winner was Tom Pope. Conor McAleny gets a non-consolation goal for Fleetwood. “We don’t have any VAR problems in Scotland, Rob, largely due to the fact that we don’t have VAR,” says Simon McMahon. “I think there’s a lesson in there for all of us. Peace and love. X “PS If we did Scotland would have won the 1978 World Cup. “PPS Lol.” I can’t wait for the post-match interview Take that, “VAR”. After having a goal ruled out in the first half, Dominic Solanke finally scores his first goal for Bournemouth. This is my favourite email of a very long day, the dry musings of a man ready to do time for his beliefs “I can see how there might have been some confusion on City’s third goal,” says J.R in Illinois. “On first viewing it looked like Harwood-Bellis’s left buttcheek hairs may have been standing in an offside position when Stones’s shot went in off him. But upon closer inspection the fraying fabric on the outside of the collar lining of Leon Legge’s left boot was clearly and obviously playing Harwood-Bellis onside. Good goal.” The latest scores Bournemouth 3-0 Luton Fleetwood 0-2 Portsmouth Leicester City 2-0 Wigan Athletic Manchester City 4-1 Port Vale Wolves 0-0 Manchester United A second goal for Philip Billing. Manchester City 4-1 Port Vale “How does Katharine Tabarner know (VAR and City 3rd goal)?” says Neil Truby. “I’m in the bloody stadium and we haven’t a clue how or what was going on!” It’s almost as if football has sold its soul to television! Phil Foden makes the most of a rare start, scoring his third goal of the season to seal victory for City. Wolves 0-0 Manchester United Wolves have had a goal disallowed for handball at Molineux. They have been much the better side in the second half. And John Marquis does likewise for Portsmouth. The substitute Callum Wilson scores with his first touch to seal victory, probably, for Bournemouth. Wolves 0-0 Manchester United Marcus Rashford has hit the bar 27 seconds after coming on as substitute. Portsmouth, who won the FA Cup in 2008 (yes, yes, and 1939) and reached the final in 2010 (yes, yes, and 1929 and 1934), are ahead at Fleetwood thanks to James Bolton. Manchester City 3-1 Port Vale Here’s Katharine Tabarner with a full explanation of that third City goal. “Aguero headed across the area, the ball broke for Stones and it deflected off the calf of the youngster on its way in. The VAR check took ages with lines being drawn and redrawn.” The latest scores Bournemouth 1-0 Luton Fleetwood 0-0 Portsmouth Leicester City 2-0 Wigan Athletic Manchester City 3-1 Tom Pope Wolves 0-0 Manchester United Manchester City 3-1 Port Vale I’ll be honest, I haven’t a clue what happened with that third City goal, primarily because I haven’t seen it. It sounds like there was a VAR check for offside after John Stones had scored, and then the goal was given to Taylor Harwood-Bellis because it hit him on the line. No he hasn’t - it was the 17-year-old Taylor Harwood-Bellis who scored on his home debut! Stones got the assist. John Stones has equalised against Tom Pope! The latest scores Bournemouth 1-0 Luton Fleetwood 0-0 Portsmouth Leicester City 2-0 Wigan Athletic Manchester City 2-1 Tom Pope Wolves 0-0 Manchester United “If there’s one thing more entertaining than seeing players give it the big one, it’s seeing players give it the big one and then delivering,” says Matt Dony. “Good on Pope. Great to see him get a goal.” Indeed. If you haven’t heard his Undr the Cosh interview, it’s hugely entertaining. I can’t recommend Undr the Cosh enough; it’s consistently brilliant. Wolves 0-0 Manchester United Wolves, with Raul Jimenez on as sub, have started the second half superbly at Molineux. Scott Murray has the latest. The half-time scores Bournemouth 1-0 Luton Fleetwood 0-0 Portsmouth Leicester City 2-0 Wigan Athletic Manchester City 2-1 Port Vale Wolves 0-0 Manchester United Bournemouth 1-0 Luton Late drama in the first half, with Luton’s Alan Sheehan smacking a penalty against the bar in the seventh minute of added time. Wolves 0-0 Manchester United It’s half-time at Molineux. Scott Murray is following that one. Port Vale were level for seven minutes (not counting the mezzanine VAR check). But it doesn’t matter how many City score now; Tom Pope has already won. Harvey Barnes doubles Leicester’s lead. That should - should - be enough. Twitter’s Tom Pope has equalised for Port Vale! It was a terrific header, apparently, though sadly it didn’t involve John Stones being left in a heap. Manchester City 1-0 Port Vale “One yard out, open goal, falling backwards,” writes J.A Hopkin. “David Silva hits the bar...” I love this groundbreaking form of journalism, whereby the readers tell the writer what’s happening. Wolves 0-0 Manchester United That might have been a penalty for United, with Brandon Williams apparently taken down by Leander Dendoncker. Paul Tierney, the on-field referee, was not interested and VAR backed him up. If you substitute a herbal tea such as peppermint for more stimulating drinks such as coffee and 94%ABV liquor, your ability to be calm will be enhanced many times. Wolves 0-0 Manchester United Half an hour gone. Manchester United have had loads of possession, and you know what that means: it’s 0-0. Harry Maguire is struggling with what looks like a hip problem. That would be a huge blow at the best of times, never mind when you have Manchester City (twice) and Liverpool to play this month. “Nice try with this pseudo-Zen attitude you’re adopting towards that which should not be mentioned,” says Charlie. “But you’re not fooling anyone, and we both know that by the end of this round of games you’re going to be a raging, spluttering wreck because someone’s toe was offside. If you keep trying to bottle it up, at some point in the next ninety minutes there’s going to be an explosion in King’s Place that will be heard throughout the land.” Let’s hope so. The latest scores Bournemouth 1-0 Luton Fleetwood 0-0 Portsmouth Leicester City 1-0 Wigan Athletic Manchester City 1-0 Port Vale Wolves 0-0 Manchester United “Last season I followed the Coupe de France and to these foreign eyes it seems to have oodles of romance,” says Kári Tulinius. “A story like today’s, a team traveling to mainland France from an island in the Indian Ocean and emerging victorious, just couldn’t happen in any other national competition I know of. The Magique of the Coupe.” You betcha. Apart from Wolves v Man Utd, which is live on BT Sport, we can’t see the goals from the 5.31pm games, hence the Pulitzer-bothering entries below. It’s also there! It’s there! As well as being a boor and a bore, VAR has now been exposed as heartless swine: Dominic Solanke’s goal has been ruled out for an offside in the build-up. A year and a day after joining the club, Dominic Solanke finally scores his first goal for Bournemouth! Wolves 0-0 Manchester United Sergio Romero has just made an outstanding reaction save at Molineux. Manchester United don’t have much to boast about these days, but they can claim one of the best reserve goalkeepers in the world. “I once won a lifetime supply of Marmite in a newspaper competition, Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “I’ve still got the jar; I can send it to you if you’re interested.” “In my opinion, match broadcasts should be labelled to indicate whether or not VAR is in use,” says Peter Oh. “Kind of like the ‘gluten-free’ and ‘non-GMO’ labels on food products.” VAR, you say? Well, most worries are future-based. They revolve around things that, in most cases, will never happen. Concentrate on the present and the future will take care of itself. Bournemouth have been struggling of late, but Philip Billing has given them an early lead against occasional giant-killers Luton. “Port Vale NOT Preston,” says Anne Oakes of an earlier mistake that has now been corrected so there’s no point me linking to it because it’s no longer there. “I am a Burslem ex-pat in France enjoying the end of the festivities so I have nothing better to do than point out your mistake...” Ach, I thought nobody has spotted. Peep peep! The 5.31pm games are under way. Scott Murray is also following Wolves v Man Utd. “Hi Rob,” says Grant Tennille. “Wading in ill-advisedly, I feel certain, but re: jinxing/tempting fate at Watford, how early is too early to deem something a ‘consolation’ goal? If this question has shades of the whole ‘what makes a foul ”tactical”’ discussion, then please accept my apologies.” Consolation goals, like beauty and Marmite, are in the eye of the beholder. I suppose the events of 4 February 2004 should have taught us there is no such thing as a foregone conclusion. And here’s your hot-off-the-press report on Watford’s spectacular capitulation Tranmere’s heroic comeback at Vicarage Road: And these are the late kick-offs Bournemouth v Luton Fleetwood v Portsmouth Leicester City v Wigan Athletic Manchester City v Port Vale (aka John Stones v Tom Pope) Wolves v Manchester United And our take from the south coast, where Brighton came unstuck against Sheffield Wednesday: Our match report from Fulham: The biggest cup shock of the day has come in France: “Way to go Rob,” says Ivar Laanen. “You really jinxed Watford with your little speech, in which you said, ‘They’ve played four home games under Nigel Pearson, including today, and it’s probably not tempting fate to suggest they have won all four.’ It’s your fault Tranmere came back. Well done.” You make a fair point. I suppose I would say there is seldom any rational reason for having regrets about past deeds or events. Because the past does not exist in any other way than in your memory. When you recognise this lack of reality, you can be calm. Peep peep! That’s it for the 3.01pm matches. I’m going to take a short break, but will be back for the 5.31pm kick-offs. The full-time scores Brentford 1-0 Stoke Brighton 0-1 Sheffield Wednesday Cardiff 2-2 Carlisle Fulham 2-1 Aston Villa Oxford 4-1 Hartlepool Preston 2-4 Norwich Reading 2-2 Blackpool Southampton 2-0 Huddersfield Watford 3-3 Tranmere A dog of a game, by all accounts, but Brentford are through. Two teenagers, Will Smallbone and Jake Vokins, scored to give Southampton a comfortable victory. Non-league Hartlepool threatened a shock when they led in the first half, but Oxford were too good after the break. Two brilliant goals from Anthony Knockaert and Harry Arter give Fulham victory over Premier League Aston Villa. Cardiff come from 2-0 down at half-time to avoid a shock defeat. That was a cracking game, and included a Panenka that hit the bar from Armand Gnanduillet. Peep peep! League One Tranmere come from three goals down at half-time to earn a replay. The Irish teenager Adam Idah’s accomplished hat-trick puts Norwich through without alarm. Peep peep! Sheffield Wednesday have put Premier League Brighton out of the FA Cup. Another teenager, Jake Vokins, seals Southampton’s place in the last 32 with a deflected shot. Only Liverpool and Manchester City have scored more goals in all competitions than Oxford this season. “The way it’s used at the moment, VAR is not conducive to anyone’s mental health and well-being, I reckon,” says Simon McMahon. “The powers that be should try the more mindful approach to decision making pioneered by the MBM. Seriously. Just ask the MBM. It’d be quicker, and more accurate.” I agree. Add a dab of lavender to milk, leave town with an orange and pretend you’re laughing at it. Tariqe Fosu-Henry scores an open goal to seal an impressive comeback from Oxford. Watford 3-3 Tranmere He kicked out at a Tranmere player, and he’s off. Paul Mullin hammers it down the middle! Tranmere, who were lucky to be 3-0 down at half-time, are level! Blah blah, Tranmere have a penalty! Oh my days. Ther’s more football after this “According to the commentator, Monthe is pronounced Montay,” says Mac Millings, “so I’m guessing his nickname is Burns.” The latest scores Brentford 1-0 Stoke Brighton 0-1 Sheffield Wednesday Cardiff 2-2 Carlisle Fulham 2-1 Aston Villa Oxford 2-1 Hartlepool Preston 1-4 Norwich Reading 2-2 Blackpool Southampton 1-0 Huddersfield Watford 3-2 Tranmere “How about that hat-trick for the young Cork man, Idah?” says J.R in Illinois. “Pretty sweet. And here is where I mention that if they had been using VAR his third goal would have been chalked off as he was offside before he won the penalty. Sorry. VAR is so terrible that even when it isn’t in use the mere fact that it exists is so disheartening as to ruin non-VAR games as well.” VAR, you say? There is little doubt that those who get the most from life are those who look for the wonder in even the smallest things they do. Cultivate this skill and you’ll find peace and satisfaction as well. Crikey. A mistake from the Watford keeper Daniel Bachmann allows Emmanuel Monthe to bring Tranmere right back into the match. If his nickname isn’t Cremda, then the world is going to hell in a handcart. “You’ve accidentally added the word ‘again’ to the end of that sentence (4.20pm),” says Matt Dony. “(Also, what could a therapist possibly offer you that you can’t get from an extensive network of well-balanced, rational, intelligent MBM correspondents?)” I’m sorry, I thought that was a rhetorical question. Fulham are ahead for the second time thanks to the on-loan Harry Arter. Oxford have battered Hartlepool in the second half and deserve their lead. It’s a beautiful solo goal, too, from Shannon Baptiste, who moves elegantly through the defence and eases the ball into the net. For the love of blood pressure, I can’t keep up with this. Arnand Gnanduillet has missed a penalty for Blackpool, Panenkaing it onto the crossbar. Reading equalise for the second time! Connor Jennings gets a consolation goal for Tranmere. Fulham 1-1 Aston Villa That goal came from Anwar El Ghazi, who apparently nicked it off Jonathan Kodjia. Jack Reach’s deflected free-kick has given Sheffield Wednesday the lead at the Amex Stadium! Villa are level! But another Premier League team are in trouble... There’s your third round fairytale! Adam Idah, the 18-year-old striker from Cork, scores from the penalty spot to complete a hat-trick on his FA Cup debut. Reading were level for only four minutes. Armand Gnanduillet has restored Blackpool’s lead with a thunderbast- spectacular strike. “The main problem with VAR isn’t the V part, it’s the AR part, the human part,” says J.R. in Illinois. “I have seen the VAR make some seriously grievous decisions but you should have seen me at the moment I realised that they were using VAR in some, but not all, FA Cup matches. I was literally shocked and my mouth involuntarily hung open for several moments in disbelief. What rocket scientists came up with that plan? And why am I surprised even though I know I shouldn’t be?” I wish I could reply, but my therapist says I need to stop talking about VAR and start loving myself again. The latest scores Brentford 1-0 Stoke Brighton 0-0 Sheffield Wednesday Cardiff 2-2 Carlisle Fulham 1-0 Aston Villa Oxford 1-1 Hartlepool Preston 0-3 Norwich Reading 1-1 Blackpool Southampton 1-0 Huddersfield Watford 3-0 Tranmere Another equaliser, this time at the Madejski Stadium, thanks to a stinging shot from Sam Baldock. Cardiff have scored twice in the first 10 minutes of the second half, with Gavin Whyte grabbing the equaliser. Brighton 0-0 Sheffield Wednesday Steven Fletcher has been stretchered off with what sounds like a very bad injury. He landed awkwardly on a straight leg, and the BT Sport pundits think it could be a cruciate-ligament injury. At the age of 32, that’s especially worrying. Robert Hall scores a fine goal, not dissimilar to Knockaert’s, to equalise for Oxford against non-league Hartlepools. Aston Villa could be the first Premier League side to go out of the FA Cup. Anthony Knockaert moves infield from the right and whips a beautiful curling shot into the top corner. That’s a lovely goal. Cardiff are back in the game thanks to Callum Paterson. Yep. The impressive teenager Will Smallbone marks his debut with an accomplished finish to give Southampton the lead. Preston pull one back at the start of the second half. A corner bounces around the Norwich area before Billy Bodin does the necessary. “Albion Rovers 0-3 Stirling Albion is the half time at Cliftonhill,” writes our unpaid etc. Simon McMahon. “This year is the 100th anniversary of Rovers’ solitary appearance in a major cup final, the 1920 Scottish Cup. Having beaten Rangers in a second replay to reach the final, they lost 3-2 to Kilmarnock in front of 95,000 at Hampden. Apparently their goalkeeper arrived at Hampden direct from the cells, having been somewhat ‘tired and emotional’ the previous evening.” And some people have the effrontery to say football has never been better. “Watford cruised to a 3-0 lead at the break,” writes our unpaid intern American Watford correspondent Mac Millings. “The Hornets really didn’t create an awful lot, but when they did, they made it count, with three beautifully taken goals. Tranmere have worked hard, and their travelling support have been tremendous, but Watford simply have too much quality for them. Dele-Bashiru in particular has looked sharp.” The half-time scores Brentford 1-0 Stoke Brighton 0-0 Sheffield Wednesday Cardiff 0-2 Carlisle Fulham 0-0 Aston Villa Oxford 0-1 Hartlepool Preston 0-3 Norwich Reading 0-1 Blackpool Southampton 0-0 Huddersfield Watford 3-0 Tranmere There’s a shock on in Wales. Harry McKirdy has put Carlisle, who sit 21st in League Two, a couple of goals ahead against the Championship side Cardiff. Shane Long has a goal disallowed for an unclear and unobvious offside. Emiliano Marcondes scores for 2021’s hipster favourites. Brighton 0-0 Sheffield Wednesday “Steven Fletcher’s barnet looks magnificent,” says John Hartson on BT Sport. “He had less hair than me 12 months ago. Now he looks like Rod Stewart!” The exciting Irish teenager Adam Idah gets his second, clipping the ball into an empty net from 40 yards. He looks a prospect, this lad. The latest scores Brentford 0-0 Stoke Brighton 0-0 Sheffield Wednesday Cardiff 0-1 Carlisle Fulham 0-0 Aston Villa Oxford 0-1 Hartlepool Preston 0-2 Norwich Reading 0-1 Blackpool Southampton 0-0 Huddersfield Watford 3-0 Tranmere Watford’s spectacular revival continues. They’ve played four home games under Nigel Pearson, including today, and it’s probably not tempting fate to suggest they have won all four. Roberto Pereyra has put them 3-0 up against Tranmere with a classy finish. ICYMI, the biggest story of the early games came at Spotland, where 17-year-old Luke Matheson set up 40-year-old Aaron Wilbraham to earn a deserved replay for Rochdale against Norwich. Blackpool lead against the run of play. Nathan Delfouneso, the former England Under-21 striker, has scored from close range. A mistake from the Preston keeper Connor Ripley allows Onel Hernandez to double Norwich’s lead. Southampton 0-0 Huddersfield Southampton might have had a penalty for a shirt pull on Jan Vestergaard. VAR is being used, but decided it was not a clear and obvious foul. Don’t go there, I’m on a VAR detox. “From the photo of Millwall’s third goal,” begins Peter Littley, “it seems there were more goals than paying spectators.” The latest scores Brentford 0-0 Stoke Brighton 0-0 Sheffield Wednesday Cardiff 0-1 Carlisle Fulham 0-0 Aston Villa Oxford 0-1 Hartlepool Preston 0-1 Norwich Reading 0-0 Blackpool Southampton 0-0 Huddersfield Watford 2-0 Tranmere Tranmere try to play out from the back. It doesn’t go entirely to plan, and Nathaniel Chalobah makes it 2-0 to Watford. It’s haemorrhaging goals in the FA Cup. Jack Bridge wins a dodgy penalty and takes it himself. His effort is saved but he scores from the replay. Watford Reserves take an early lead through a cracking long-range strike from Tom Dele-Bashiru. Non-league Hartlepool lead at Oxford! The home side faffed around in defence, allowing Mark Kitching to nip in and score. “No cup games in Scotland this week as the big boys take a break, but you don’t get more romantic than the Scottish lower leagues, do you?” swoons Simon McMahon. “In the Scottish Championship, runaway leaders Dundee United make the long trip to Dumfries to face Queen of the South. The Tannadice men have won nine and drawn one of their last ten in the league, establishing a 14-point lead over the chasing pack in the process. Their last defeat was at Queen of the South, though, a 4-0 shellacking at that, so they’ll be keen to take revenge today. There’s also an Albion derby as it’s Albion Rovers v Stirling Albion. You don’t get more romantic than that, eh?” An early lead for Norwich, with the Irish teenager Adam Idah scoring very confidently from Marco Stiepermann’s through pass. I am paraphrasing Chris Sutton on BT Sport here, as they are not allowed to show the goals from the 3.01pm kick-offs. Bah, gah and bah some more: it was fun being able to see the thing I have to describe during the early games. Peep peep! The 3.01pm games are under way. Here’s the match report from our man in Rochdale: Peep peep! I’m going to take a short break before the 3.01pm games begin. In the meantime, here’s a quiz. The final scores in the 12.31pm kick-offs Birmingham 2-1 Blackburn Bristol City 1-1 Shrewsbury Town Burnley 4-2 Peterborough Millwall 3-0 Newport County Rochdale 1-1 Newcastle Rotherham 2-3 Hull Peep peep! Tom Eaves’ earthy hat-trick has put Hull into the fourth round. Rotherham 2-3 Hull City Rotherham almost equalise straight away, with Reece Burke heading against his own post! Tom Eaves completes his hat-trick to put Hull into the next round! He headed home from close range after a scramble at a corner, and celebrated in style by whipping off his top to reveal a GPS vest. Jeremie Bela’s late goal puts ten-man Birmingham in the last 32. An impressive performance from Shrewsbury, who could easily have won at Ashton Gate. A pretty comfortable victory for a strong Burnley side, who led 3-0 after 23 minutes and were never in danger after that. Peep peep! Aaron Wilbraham, the FA Cup’s great quadragenarian, secures a lucrative and deserves replay for Rochdale against injury-hit Newcastle. Ten-man Birmingham have nicked it! Jeremie Bela moves into the area and sidefoots a low cross-shot through the keeper Jayson Leutwiler. That was poor keeping and even worse defending, with all the Blackburn players backing away from Bela in the area. An easy win for Gary Rowett’s side. Rochdale 1-1 Newcastle Steve Bruce’s side are hanging on for dear life, or at least a replay, at Spotland. Follow the last few minutes with Scott Murray. These are the 3.01pm fixtures, more of which anon. Brentford v Stoke Brighton v Sheffield Wednesday Cardiff v Carlisle Fulham v Aston Villa Oxford v Hartlepools Preston v Norwich Reading v Blackpool Southampton v Huddersfield Watford v Tranmere “Oh damn, somebody already beat me to it!” says Adam Hirst, who has sent a link to that Malcolm Macdonald goal (1.49pm). “That’ll teach me to concentrate on the cricket and only look in on you occasionally. Mind you, I bet that’s what you’re doing as well…” That’s a despicable slur on my professionalism . I am completely focussed on the third round on the fact thaT DEAN ELGAR HAS JUST SLOGGED DOM BESS STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR! WOOHOO, YA DANCER!

Oh my, this is a classic FA Cup story! Aaron Wilbraham, aged 40 (F-O-R-T-Y), has come off the bench to equalise for Rochdale against Newcastle. Scott Murray has more. The teenager Ricky Jade-Jones pulls one back for Peterborough, shinning a volley into the net from close range after a scramble at a corner. Millwall 2-0 Newport Joss Labadie is lucky to get only a yellow card after planting his studs into the calf of Connor Mahoney. Rotherham 2-2 Hull The referee spent an age talking to the assistant about whether the ball went out of play before Kane crossed for Eaves to score. That’s all very strange, because there’s no VAR, and it didn’t go out of play anyway. Everyone’s lost the noggin post-VAR. Hull are level against ten-man Rotherham. Tom Eaves gets his second goal, stretching to head into the net after a fine run down the left by Herbie Kane. Latest scores Birmingham 1-1 Blackburn (Birmingham down to 10 men) Bristol City 1-1 Shrewsbury Town Burnley 4-1 Peterborough Millwall 2-0 Newport County Rochdale 0-1 Newcastle Rotherham 2-1 Hull (Rotherham down to 10 men) Birmingham 1-1 Blackburn Sunjic only came on as a substitute two minutes before he was sent off. Good lad. Millwall double their lead through Connor Mahoney’s calm penalty. Blackburn are level - and Birmingham are down to 10 men. Ivan Sunjic, mistaking himself for Franz Beckenbauer, gave the ball away to Sam Gallagher and compounded the mistake by shoving his over in the penalty area. He was sent off, and Adam Armstrong thumped the penalty down the middle. Rochdale 0-1 Newcastle Ian Henderson has hit the post for Rochdale, who are putting Newcastle under increasing pressure. This is a great spot from Gavin English “Rob, take a look at this – almost identical to Kyle Vassell’s goal.” Latest scores Birmingham 1-0 Blackburn Bristol City 1-1 Shrewsbury Town Burnley 4-1 Peterborough Millwall 1-0 Newport County Rochdale 0-1 Newcastle Rotherham 2-1 Hull (Rotherham down to 10 men) Rochdale 0-1 Newcastle What, another one? Yep, Newcastle have suffered their 48th injury of the festive period. Scott Murray has the details. Millwall 1-0 Newport Padraig Amond has missed a great chance for Newport, scuffing a loose ball wide from eight yards. Aaron Lennon plays a beautiful reverse pass to put Jay Rodriguez through, and he finishes with the minimum of fuss. Shrewsbury equalise with a fine goal. A corner was half cleared to Sean Goss, 25 yards from goal, and he curled a lovely, precise shot that went into the net off the far post. Half-time entertainment This is great, the end. Peep peep! It’s half-time in the six 12.31pm games, and these are the scores: Birmingham 1-0 Blackburn Bristol City 1-0 Shrewsbury Town Burnley 3-1 Peterborough Millwall 1-0 Newport County Rochdale 0-1 Newcastle Rotherham 2-1 Hull (Rotherham down to 10 men) What a goal! Kyle Vassell has given 10-man Rotherham the lead with a spectacular goal from the left edge of the box. He allowed a short throw to run across his body, waited for the ball to bounce up and smashed a swirling shot that flew over Matt Ingram and into the far corner. It was very similiar to this goal from Steve McManaman, only better. You don’t see many consolation goals in the first half, but Peterborough have got one at Turf Moor. Matthew Lowton’s backheader was short, and Ivan Toney danced around Joe Hart to score confidently from a tight angle. “My favourite third round goal is Shane Long for Reading vs Liverpool in 2010,” says Rob Evans. “Cold, possibly snowy weekday evening. We’re playing well but it’s Liverpool, and it’s Anfield and somehow it is extra time. Reading favourite Bryn Gunnarson turns into Garrincha, throws in a Cruyff turn and a nutmeg before pinging in for Shane Long to score.” “I join Mr. Pearson in my astonishment that all the early matches are available here in the colonies,” says James Thomas. “I’ve opted for Birmingham-Blackburn, although I’m really waiting for Fulham-Aston Villa later. What do the Cottagers need to do, in your humble estimation, to earn promotion, and stick, this season?” Erm, win the play-offs? I’m no Championship expert – I’m not sure I’m an anything expert – but it does look like Leeds and West Brom will be hard to catch. Bristol City 1-0 Shrewbury Town Ah, here we go. A short corner on the left, a deep cross and a precise looping header from Famara Diedhiou. I can’t describe this one because BT Sport are currently on an ad break. Hotels.com, since you asked. Latest scores Birmingham 1-0 Blackburn Bristol City 0-0 Shrewsbury Town Burnley 3-0 Peterborough Millwall 1-0 Newport County Rochdale 0-1 Newcastle Rotherham 1-1 Hull (Rotherham down to 10 men) Rotherham 1-1 Hull Rotherham are down to 10 men. Adam Thompson has been sent off for a studs-up lunge at Keane Lewis-Potter. I suspect it was overzealous rather than malicious, but it was a dangerous tackle and he had to walk. “Mickey Thomas’s free kick against for Wrexham against Arsenal would still be rising today had the net not stopped it,” says Matt Dony. “Xabi Alonso scored against Luton from way inside his own half on his WRONG FOOT. But, although it might not be the most romantic or spectacular choice, Van Dijk’s header against Everton two years ago looks like a turning point. He announced his arrival in style, and went on to have a ridiculously transformative effect on the team. That one probably gets my vote. I want to be VVD when I grow up.” Jeff Hendrick’s deflected shot from the edge of the area extendes Burnley’s lead. An equaliser for Rotherham! Michael Smith, given too much time in the area, slams a rising shot into the top corner. The latest scores Birmingham 1-0 Blackburn Bristol City 0-0 Shrewsbury Town Burnley 2-0 Peterborough Millwall 1-0 Newport County Rochdale 0-1 Newcastle Rotherham 0-1 Hull “Evening Rob,” says Patrick O’Brien. “My favourite MIKEL ARTETA!!!!! third round goal MIKEL!!!!! ARTE!!!!!TA was MIKEL ARTETA!!!!!!! when ... um, effing love MIKEL ARTETA me.” Hull take a slightly underserved lead at the New York Stadium, with Tom Eaves dragging a low shot into the corner from close range. A neat finish from Miguel Almiron gives Newcastle a deserved lead. Scott Murray will tell you more. Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive, but to be a Clockwatcher was very heaven We can’t see the goals when we do Premier League clockwatches, which makes for a peculiar experience. Thankfully BT Sport are allowed to show the goals from the 12.31pm games. It’s quite an experience to actually describe the goals rather than paraphrase Paul Merson and Matt Le Tissier. Burnley are cruising into the fourth round. Erik Pieters, 25 yards out, thumps a bouncing ball across Christy Pym and into the far corner. The keeper might have done better. A preview of one of tomorrow’s big games Burnley 1-0 Peterborough Pym makes a good save from Gudmundsson’s low shot. Peterborough could be blown away here. A question for both you readers: what’s your favourite FA Cup third round goal and why? I’m not sure I can get past Ronnie Radford. Rodriguez gives Burnley the lead from close range after Chris Wood’s header is saved by Christy Pym. He was offside in the build up, but it was a new phase of play by the time he scored, which meant the goal survived a VAR check. Incidentally, VAR is only being used in matches at Premier League grounds. Millwall take an early lead with Matt Smith scoring from 10 yards after a left-wing corner was allowed too bounce across the box. Birmingham have scored the first goal of the third round. Daniel Crowley, once of Arsenal, surges from the halfway line to the edge of the box and cracks a low shot into the far corner. Good goal, that. Burnley and Newcastle, the two Premier League sides playing this lunchtime, have both picked strong XIs. It will be hard for any of the Small 13 to win the competition, but there is certainly scope for a run to the semi-finals, perhaps the final. “One of the reasons I subscribed to ESPN+ was so I could watch FA Cup matches here in the USA,” says Joe Pearson. “Little did I expect they would ALL be available. What do I do?” Watch Rochdale v Newcastle, and keep pressing F5 on this clockwatch so that we get more hits and The Man labours under the misapprehension that I am more popular than the average Clockwatcher. He might even give me a packet of bonbons. The 12.31pm games are about to kick off. A reminder that Scott Murray is following Rochdale v Newcastle. “Happy new year!” says Mike MacKenzie. “Not sure how practical the following ideas are but offer them anyway to improve FA Cup: 1) No replays from 3rd round on. I think Jamie Carragher has suggested this among others. Would result in more upsets as well as fewer games. 2) Move winter break to January. Have it start after the 3rd round FA Cup weekend. That might encourage teams to play their best sides knowing they’ll get a rest after.” I like the first idea in particular, but the climate has changed so much that I don’t think there’s a way to restore the FA Cup’s 20th-century status. Actually, there is one way: football could buy back its soul. But there is more chance of me waking up tomorrow morning with a lustrous mullet. As with 99.9999 per cent of everything Scott Murray writes, this is a brilliant read And here’s a preview of every third round match Peterborough think they will be facing a shadow Burnley side when they turn up for an early kick-off at Turf Moor, and they might be right. The FA Cup has come at an awkward time for the Clarets, who have lost six of their last eight league games, are only four points above the relegation zone and face Chelsea, Leicester, Manchester United and Arsenal when the Premier League resumes. Sean Dyche will still try to pick a side capable of winning the tie against League One’s top scorers, but anything could happen. VAR will be in use here, as it will be at all ties hosted by Premier League teams. Some pre-match reading Hello. These all-dayers are getting out of hand. It was the Premier League on New Year’s Day, and today it’s an FA Cup third round special. First orders will be at 12.31pm, when the opening round of matches kick off. There are more games at 3.01pm, then a third lot starting at 5.31pm. We’ll have separate MBMs for the two televised games, Rochdale v Newcastle and Wolves v Man Utd while muggins here will attempt to keep up with all the other games. The unusual kick-off times, as you are probably aware, are so that we can take a minute or three to think about mental health. Football has come a long way in the 21 years since Stan Collymore was made a pariah. Alas, the FA Cup has become a bit of an outcast in that time, certainly in comparison to the big Leagues. We’re all friends here, so let us speak frankly: the FA Cup third round does not have the magic/romance/insert preferred cliche here it once did. It will never mean as much as it did in the days of Ronnie Radford, Matthew Hanlan and Micky Thomas. (The saddest thing about the FA Cup, since you asked, is that its greatest day, 8 April 1990, hastened its demise.) It is still English football’s greatest giantkilling canvas, though, and the likelihood is that, at some stage this weekend, a few players will define their careers. Maybe even their lives.

9,article,environment/2019/oct/26/gm-golden-rice-delay-cost-millions-of-lives-child-blindness,Environment,2019-10-26,Block on GM rice ‘has cost millions of lives and led to child blindness’,https://gu.com/p/ctb4e,News,Block on GM rice ‘has cost millions of lives and led to child blindness’,Eco groups and global treaty blamed for delay in supply of vitamin-A enriched Golden Rice,750,"Stifling international regulations have been blamed for delaying the approval of a food that could have helped save millions of lives this century. The claim is made in a new investigation of the controversy surrounding the development of Golden Rice by a team of international scientists. Golden Rice is a form of normal white rice that has been genetically modified to provide vitamin A to counter blindness and other diseases in children in the developing world. It was developed two decades ago but is still struggling to gain approval in most nations. “Golden Rice has not been made available to those for whom it was intended in the 20 years since it was created,” states the science writer Ed Regis. “Had it been allowed to grow in these nations, millions of lives would not have been lost to malnutrition, and millions of children would not have gone blind.” Vitamin A deficiency is practically unknown in the west, where it is found in most foods. For individuals in developing countries, however, vitamin A is a matter of life or death. Lack of it is believed to be responsible for killing more children than HIV, tuberculosis or malaria – around 2,000 deaths a day. On a global scale, about a third of children under five suffer from the condition which can also lead to blindness. As a solution to this crisis, Peter Beyer, professor of cell biology at Freiburg University in Germany, and Ingo Potrykus of the Institute of Plant Sciences in Switzerland, turned to the new technology of genetic manipulation in the late 20th century. They inserted genes for a chemical known as beta-carotene into the DNA of normal rice. In this way, they modified the rice genes so that the plants started to make beta-carotene, a rich orange-coloured pigment that is also a key precursor chemical used by the body to make vitamin A. “In Bangladesh, China, India and elsewhere in Asia, many children subsist on a few bowls of rice a day and almost nothing else. For them, a daily supply of Golden Rice could now bring the gift of life and sight,” states Regis in his book, Golden Rice, which is published this month. Unfortunately, that daily supply has not materialised – and Regis is clear where the blame lies. For a start, many ecology action groups, in particular Greenpeace, have tried to block approval of Golden Rice because of their general opposition to GM crops. “Greenpeace opposition to Golden Rice was especially persistent, vocal, and extreme, perhaps because Golden Rice was a GM crop that had so much going for it,” he states. For its part, Greenpeace has insisted over the years that Golden Rice is a hoax and that its development was diverting resources from dealing with general global poverty, which it maintained was the real cause of the planet’s health woes. Nevertheless, this opposition did not have the power, on its own, to stop Golden Rice in its tracks, says Regis. The real problem has rested with an international treaty known as the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, an agreement which aims to ensure the safe handling, transport and use of living modified organisms, and which came into force in 2003. The Cartagena Protocol contains a highly controversial clause known as Principle 15 or, more commonly, the precautionary principle. This states that if a product of modern biotechnology poses a possible risk to human health or the environment, measures should be taken to restrict or prevent its introduction. The doctrine, in the case of Golden Rice, was interpreted as “guilty until proven innocent”, says Regis, an attitude entirely out of kilter with the potential of the crop to save millions of lives and halt blindness. As a result, every aspect of Golden Rice development, from lab work to field trials to screening, became entangled “in a Byzantine web of rules, guidelines, requirements, restrictions, and prohibitions”, and it is only in the last few years that steps have been taken to give it approval – though so far only in the US, Canada and Australia. It is still awaiting the go-ahead – hopefully by the end of this year – in countries such as the Philippines and Bangladesh, where it is far more urgently needed. “The effects of withholding, delaying or retarding Golden Rice development through overcautious regulation has imposed unconscionable costs in terms of years of sight and lives lost,” Regis concludes.

10,article,music/2019/oct/24/neil-young-and-crazy-horse-colorado-album-review,Music,2019-10-24,"Neil Young and Crazy Horse: Colorado review – a direct, disgruntled din",https://gu.com/p/chqga,Arts,"Neil Young and Crazy Horse: Colorado review – a direct, disgruntled din",<p><strong>(Reprise)</strong><br>Deeply personal ballads and the incredible potency of his band elevate Young’s 39th album above his painfully on-the-nose political messaging</p>,877,"It’s hard to know where to level your expectations of Neil Young’s 39th album. On the one hand, it’s a long time since Young made a genuinely great album of original material – the Daniel Lanois-produced Le Noise, which came out nearly a decade ago – and longer still since he managed to reach anything like the skyscraping artistic heights he attained as a matter of course in the 1970s: the charts are full of people who weren’t even born when Sleeps With Angels was released in 1994. On the other hand, Colorado is an album recorded amid personal turmoil – his ex-wife Pegi died of cancer in January; Elliot Roberts, his manager and co-conspirator for half a century, passed away in June – and, unfortunately for him, Young has a tendency to make his best albums amid personal turmoil and loss: On the Beach, Tonight’s the Night, Sleeps With Angels, even Le Noise, which was haunted by the loss of longtime collaborators Ben Keith and Larry Johnson. Then again, Colorado arrives with an accompanying film, Mountaintop, and there are few phrases more likely to sink the spirits of the long-term Young fan than “Neil’s made another film”. Young has persisted in making films since the early 70s without ever getting any better at it; his filmography is a now-bulging file of evidence to suggest he should step away from the director’s chair for the good of humanity. As it turns out, Mountaintop is merely boring, rather than excruciating: anyone who wants to spend 90 minutes watching Neil Young arguing about the volume of his amplifier and inhaling oxygen to combat the altitude of the Colorado studio where he’s recording is in for a treat, but better that than one of his arthouse films, which can leave you wondering if the more repressive Middle East theocracies didn’t have a point when it came to banning cinema altogether. The album itself, meanwhile, reunites Young with Crazy Horse, his most dependable backing band. Like Young’s film-making, Crazy Horse have somehow contrived to get no better at all over 50 years. Unlike Young’s film-making, they didn’t need to improve: from the moment they lumbered into view, horrifying Young’s peers with their rudimentary abilities, Crazy Horse sounded amazing, like some hulking, rusty bit of farm machinery that barely works but somehow generates incredible power. You can hear it on Colorado’s centrepiece, She Showed Me Love: there’s an astonishing moment halfway through when drummer Ralph Molina just stops playing, as though he mistakenly thinks the song’s over, before sheepishly starting up again a couple of beats later. But the potency of the grinding din they create is inarguable, elevating Young’s hokey lyrics – Mother Nature pushing Earth around in a pram, etc – adding an unmistakeable edge. They do the same on Shut It Down: the contrast between the sweetness of their harmonies and the corrosive noise of their guitars is enough to distract you from their leader wailing: “What about the animals? What about the birds and bees?” The problem with Colorado is that Young doesn’t want you to be distracted from his lyrics: the pretty Green Is Blue aside, the melodies are largely perfunctory and Young talks as much as he sings. He’s never been more politically and socially engaged than in recent years, which has led him to toss off screeds of songs in the all-the-news-that’s-fit-to-sing style of an old protest folkie. It’s a mode that served him well on 1970’s livid Ohio, but in truth, most of his great sociopolitical songs are oblique: the hallucinatory After the Gold Rush; Campaigner’s complex meditation on Richard Nixon’s demise; Rockin’ in the Free World’s equivocal response to the collapse of communism. Of late, his political songs have been almost painfully on the nose. As one critic rightly noted of 2015’s The Monsanto Years, the lyrics were so prosaic, it frequently felt like reading an article about the dangers of GMO; it was more effective as protest – Monsanto considered suing him – than it was as music. Here, the focus is once more on politics – Roberts’s passing is alluded to in the touching ballad Olden Days, and there are a couple of songs clearly inspired by new wife Daryl Hannah, but other than that, it’s the horrors of climate change, Trump and the alt-right all the way. You never doubt Young’s sincerity, but he expresses his message via cliches and sloganeering. In fairness, maybe he feels he has to be as direct as possible. Most artists who essay this kind of stuff do so expecting their audience to nod in agreement, but Young’s fans don’t necessarily cleave to any liberal consensus, as evidenced by the bedlam caused among their ranks by 2006’s anti-Bush Living With War. But the end result is another Neil Young album to add to the pile of the not-bad and the OK he’s amassed over the last decade, while a steady stream of archive releases highlight how great Neil Young can be at his best: as good as any artist in rock history, and certainly better than this.

They are not all doing everything; some are better than others and they could always be doing more. But as industry experts at a recent sustainability conference told me, again and again: we don’t have time to wait for perfect, or for people to reject all the conveniences of modern life. It is more important to do something now than nothing at all, to our later cost. I take the view that big change comes from big business, which is why I’ve included global megabrands where there is at least the will and potential for improvement. What constitutes improvement is another bone of contention, of course. Some believe 100% organic, non-GM products are the only way to go; others rightly point out that some crops can be grown organically only thousands of air miles away. Many of us look for recycled plastic (living only about three lives), others prefer infinitely recyclable (but much heavier to freight) glass. This lineup is more expensive than previous “best lists”, which tend to run the gamut from mass market to high luxury. Locally made, renewable and sustainably grown ingredients cost more than petrol derivatives and virgin plastic, made in bulk in China. So I apologise if some of these prices make you wince, as they did me. vg vegan, v vegetarian, cf cruelty free: all not sold in countries where animal testing is mandatory; vg contains no animal-derived ingredients.

Try Cotton Swabs, £2.50 for 100: for makeup clean-ups, eyeliner softening and against-doctor’s-orders ear cleaning. Compost when done. 2 Spectrum brushes (vg) There are lots of affordable makeup brush companies with sustainable wood or bamboo handles, and non-animal hair, but this independent brand also cut its plastic packaging by 50% in 2018 and gives 1% of its gross revenue to plastic clean-up concerns. Try MB06 brush, £5.99: if you buy only one eye brush, make it this sort of shape. A fluffy, tapered blender can be used to lay down lid colour, define the crease (rest tip in crease and oscillate like a windscreen wiper), or smudge hard lines. 3 Love, Beauty &amp; Planet (vg) Toiletries behemoth Unilever has made sustainability a focus, and its targets demonstrate serious intent: reducing its environmental impact, including every aspect of the supply chain (ingredients, manufacturing, packaging, transportation), by half. New brand Love, Beauty &amp; Planet has fun, fragrant, certified vegan body and haircare in 100% post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic bottles. The young people in my life love them. Try Delicious Glow Body Butter, £9.99 (250ml): a rich but unsticky cream containing plant and flower oils. 4 Dr Hauschka (cf) A pioneer in this field, the 50-year-old brand uses biodynamic farming methods to grow its ingredients, and green electricity wherever possible. Most of its high-quality, plant-based offering (the beautiful Cleansing Milk and iconic Rose Day Cream, for example) is packaged in glass and aluminium jars and tubes; what plastic remains has begun the transition to PCR, saving 65% of raw oil in the process. Side hustles include work with the World Hunger Project. Try Lemon Lemongrass Bath Essence, £17 (100ml): zesty, skin softening and so luxurious that the late, great Nora Ephron referenced it in a carpe diem rallying cry following the premature death of a beloved girlfriend. “Always use the good bath oil,” she said. And she was rarely wrong. 5 BYBI (vg) Instagram hit BYBI proves that it’s possible to make a beautiful-looking, highly covetable product without shafting the environment. Founders Elsie and Domenika house their entire range in glass or bioplastic tubes derived from sugarcane (you’d never know to touch them), sent in grass paper boxes, saving up to 4,800 tonnes of C02 emissions. The products are often made from food industry byproducts (the juice pulp in the serums, for example). Try Babe Balm Bronze, £12 (6ml): gives a dewy, sexy glow to cheekbones, eyelids, lips and limbs. 6 The Soap Co (vg) This British social enterprise employs, trains and fairly pays an 85% visually impaired and blind workforce. Many of its partners – from designers and lawyers to PRs and spokespeople (of which I’m one) – work pro bono. Ingredients are ethically sourced in the UK; soap bars are packaged in biofilm or recycled paper; and where plastic exists, refills are available minus the harder-to-recycle pump. Try Infinitely Recyclable Hand Wash, £20 (300ml): a bumper aluminium pump bottle of geranium-scented goodness, available to pre-order. 7 Bramley (vg) £140 sounds insane for a handwash, but for that money Bramley will give you a 5l container, plus 250ml glass bottles to refill from the mother lode. The containers can be returned if your local council won’t recycle them. If budget or storage or inclination prevents that, their “plastic” bottles (from £4) are derived from renewable sugarcane. Try Bubble Bath, £8 (100ml): if you like the kind of huge, fat foam that sticks to your chin in a Santa beard (this sits next to my own bath). 8 Weleda (cf) More than 75% of Weleda’s plant ingredients come from biodynamic or organic farming, or controlled wild collection. Its commitment to biodiversity, and ethical treatment of workers, has been recognised by the Union for Ethical BioTrade – it is one of only two beauty brands to carry the UEBT mark and was the first to earn a Look For The Zero badge, showing none of its products contains any form of plastic. Try Skin Food (Classic and Light), £7.95 (30ml): a rich, pleasingly gloopy moisturiser for face, hands and body (though I preferred the old aluminium brutalist packaging). 9 Neal’s Yard (v) The first UK brand to be Look For The Zero certified, Neal’s Yard successfully campaigned alongside Greenpeace against microbead use. This year it launched a recycling scheme inviting customers to bring in tricky-to-recycle packaging and items from any brand; its own packaging is mostly glass. Try Almond Moisturiser, £22 (50ml): recommended to me by countless readers over the years, especially those with sensitive skin. Makes a terrific makeup base, too. 10 Soaper Duper (vg) This brand’s tactile bubble bottles are made from 50% PCR plastic (down from 100%, as the company can’t source enough recycled plastic; it is working on getting the levels back up) and its tubes 55%. It has so far recycled over 22 metric tonnes of plastic and donated £150,000 to WaterAid. Try Nourishing Coconut Body Wash, £7.50 (400ml): my children like the juicy fruit varieties, my husband loves the creamy shea and vanilla. Fine, so long as they keep their mitts off this. 11 Axiology (vg) This brand’s distinctive triangular boxes are made of recycled paper in a female-owned factory in Bali which transforms local waste into packaging. Inside, a recycled, recyclable aluminium tube holds a vegan, Peta-approved, palm oil-free lipstick. Try Lipstick, £29: bold colour in luxury, pose-worthy packaging. 12 Lush (v) About 90% of Lush’s packaging is recycled, including plastic and paper that’s 100% PCR. It reckons half its products can be taken home without any packaging, and its Naked shop in Manchester is England’s first plastic packaging-free cosmetics shop. Try New Shampoo Bar, £8 (55g): a tingly, head-clearing, foaming bar, perfect if you like your scalp to feel squeaky clean and are a sucker for spicy (cinnamon and clove) smells. 13 REN (cf) Last year REN made a commitment to zero waste by 2021. Moving towards elimination of unnecessary packaging and partnering with organisations such as TerraCycle and Surfrider, it is stopping sample sachets and using recycled ocean plastic in packaging. Try Glycol Lactic Radiance Renewal Mask, £36 (50ml): a fast, noticeable makeover, smoothing and polishing tired, dull skin in 10 minutes. 14 L’Occitane This brand prides itself on never having given out plastic bags in-store and recycling since the 90s. Simply by reducing the thickness of packaging, it reckons it has already saved 28 tonnes of plastic; by 2025, it wants all its bottles to be of 100% recycled plastic and every store to offer recycling. Try Liquid Soap Refill Duo, £29 (2 x 500ml): the shea butter hand soaps are among the very best, perfect for hardworking, dry hands. 15 Gosh (cf) CO2-neutral Danish company Gosh takes 40% of the plastic packaging for its Dextreme foundation from waste from oceans, beaches and rivers. It reckons buying one foundation equates to removing at least 10 plastic bags from the seas. Meanwhile, it is launching a bodycare product made from dairy industry byproduct whey. Try 3 in 1 Hybrid Eyes in Grey Brown, £9.99: a creme eyeshadow in taupey, mushroomy brown is the fastest way for eyes to look more defined. 16 A Good Company (vg) The toothbrushes thrown away each year in the US alone could stretch round the planet four times, and the composite plastics used render them unrecyclable. This is a compelling alternative, using sustainable bamboo grown without chemicals or pesticides and compostable bristles. Try Bamboo Toothbrush, £4: cool colours, kids and adult sizes, great price and free handle-monogramming make this a fantastic stocking filler. I keep a stash for forgetful guests. 17 The Body Shop (cf) Pioneering in this field long before many brands had composted their first apple core, in 1987 it launched Community Trade, a commitment to local suppliers and projects. It has since invested in recycled plastic and given 2,500 waste pickers in India access to better working conditions, improved education and health services, a fair price for their work and predictable income. Empty containers can be returned to stores, to be recycled or repurposed. Try Skin Defence Multi Protection Essence SPF50, £17 (40ml): ungreasy, high-protection sunscreen that doesn’t peel, aggravate sensitive or oily skins, or wander off at midday. 18 Biolage (cf) All its bottles are made partially of PCR plastic, the factory in Kentucky sends no waste to landfill and uses 100% renewable energy. Its Spanish facility is a “dry factory”, meaning any water consumed goes into products or is used by employees. Try RAW Scalp Care Antidandruff Shampoo, £13.85 (325ml): lovely-smelling, vegan and really soothes and deflakes flared-up scalps. 19 Beauty Kitchen (v) This was the first beauty brand certified by B Corporation, which recognises social and environmental performance. With Return Refill Repeat, it washes and reuses its own and other brands’ packaging, and 2% of sales go to charity partners such as Plastic Soup Foundation and the Seahorse Trust. Try Seahorse Plankton Plus High Definition Facial Oil, £20 (30ml): a moisturising, skin-softening oil that behaves like something much pricier. 20 Medik 8 (vg) This cosmeceutical brand uses cold processes where possible, blending formulas at room temperature to avoid burning energy by heating ingredients. Microbead-free, it uses natural exfoliators such as jojoba beads and bamboo. It has replaced plastic inserts in cartons with recycled card; its serum bottles and pipettes are glass, 40% of it recycled. Try Intelligent Retinol, £33 (15ml): clinically proven to improve skin texture and reduce wrinkles, Medik 8 retinols are among the best on offer. 21 Davines (cf) Last year, the Italian brand unveiled its spectacular new HQ, Davines Village, featuring a host of sustainable initiatives: 100% of its electricity is from renewable sources, it is single-use plastic-free, has electric vehicle charging points and repurposes its restaurant’s organic waste. Last year the company also achieved carbon neutrality for packaging production. Try Davines Oil Non Oil, £17 (250ml): the least greasy hair oil for separating curls, taming frizz and moisturising dry ends. Curly types swear it’s magic. 22 Floral Street (vg) There are lots of luxury fragrance houses with a focus on sustainability (Clean Reserve, Sana Jardin, Laboratory) but none this accessible. Floral Street’s good quality, wearable scents come in a lovely glass and pulp carton – the first fully recyclable and biodegradable packaging in perfumery, made with recycled water, renewable energy and no chlorine. Try London Poppy, from £24 (10ml): bright, citrus, almost impossible to dislike (even for the perfume averse). 23 Aveda (cf) The first beauty company to use 100% PCR PET, now more than 85% of its containers are of 100% PCR materials. It has raised £49m for environmental initiatives since 1999 and from 2021 all its products will be vegan (its haircare already is) and its new launches will be silicone-free. Working with the nonprofit organisation charity: water, Aveda provides access to clean water for people in India, Nepal, Madagascar and Ethiopia – from where the brand ethically sources ingredients. Try Damage Remedy Daily Hair Repair, £25 (100ml): I use this leave-in balm in place of conditioner (which weighs down my fine hair) and the difference in appearance, condition, manageability, texture and ease of styling has been dramatic. 24 Tropic (vg) People who love this Australian skincare and makeup brand really, really love it. And with refill pouches, zero landfill output, biodegradable bubblewrap, plastic-free tape and certified carbon neutral company status (it is doubling its carbon offset this year, effectively becoming carbon negative), it’s hard to argue. Try Fruit Peel resurfacing serum, £42 (30ml): fruity smelling, glow-giving and makes good of tired skin. 25 Bleach London (vg) Cool girls’ favourite Bleach’s bottles will be 100% PCR by the end of this year; its cardboard and paper already are. Single-use plastics have been removed from bleach and colouring kits (the mixing bowl is a sustainable coconut shell), and product refilling stations set up in salons. The aim is to be carbon neutral by 2020. Impressive for what was, nine years ago, a single sink in an east London nail bar. Try Shampoos and conditioners, £7.50 (250ml): for anyone wanting to tone or de-yellow bleached hair. 26 Bulldog (vg) In 2017, the hugely successful British male grooming brand introduced into its tubes plastic derived from ethically souced sugarcane. Manufacture of some products uses “single-vessel quenching”, which limits the amount of water heated, and last year it introduced a bamboo-handle razor (in recycled packaging) and a 5l recycled cardboard pack of shower gel. Try Sensitive Shave Cream, £3.50 (100ml): I wish all brands selling at these prices gave this much of a damn. Beautifully does what it says on the tube, whatever area you’re shaving. 27 Ethique (vg) All its products are compostable, free of plastic, palm oil and non-sustainable paper stock. Face, hair and body products come in solid bar form, saving about 1l of water each versus bottled products. Ethique’s carbon-neutral practices are projected to save 10m plastic bottles from manufacture and landfill by 2020. Try Trial Pack for skin and hair, £11: switching to solid products requires a leap of faith, but these try-me boxes of shampoo, conditioner, cleanser and moisturiser (lasting up to 15 uses) take out the risk. 28 Herbivore (vg) It may be one of Instagram’s most photographed brands – you’ll have seen its cool, minimalist packaging on a shelfie or nine – but it’s comforting to know that millennials are lusting after recyclable glass, not landfill-bound plastic. The products are made without petrol industry derivatives and byproducts. Try Lapis Balancing Facial Oil, £22 (8ml): an oil for oilies should be a tough sell, but reviews from the acne-prone and congested are raves. 29 ZAO (cf) This brand’s bronzers, brow powders, eyeshadows, eye primers, shine-up powders and blushers are all plastic free; some items, such as the mascara, use minimal plastic refills housed in biodegradable bamboo handles. Try Mineral Cooked Powder, £23.50: a talc- and nanoparticle-free range of bronzers, for all skin tones, that buff nicely into cheeks, temples and clavicles for a sunny glow with zero patchiness or dullness. 30 Wet Brush (vg) According to research at Ohio State University, the average lifespan of a hairbrush is under a year, and most head straight to landfill. Many will have been made by Wet Brush, which is taking action to reduce the waste. Try Go Green Detangler, £14.99: slides through wet hair – from baby fine to coarse and unruly – like a hot knife through butter. Biodegrades within five years of disposal – but if it gets dirty, clean it, don’t throw it out. High luxury 31 Kjær Weis (cf) For makeup artist Kirsten Kjær Weis, recyclable or recycled packaging seemed to be delaying its retirement in landfill. She wanted a refillable model, housing her certified organic makeup in luxury polished metal palettes and containers. Refills are packed in minimalist recycled cardboard. So simple, so covetable. Try Cream Blush, £41 (3.5g): there’s a lot to love in this silicone- and mineral oil-free range, but this buttery blush, giving a whisper of healthy flush, is my ride-or-die favourite. 32 Tata Harper (v) Harper considers sustainability in every aspect of her natural product line, from raw materials (renewable, GMO-free and many grown on the Vermont farm where she lives), to production (most are handmade in small batches on the premises, all using environmentally friendly processes), to bottles (any plastic is made from corn-derived resin). All paper and card is recycled and printed with soy ink. This is farm-to-face beauty and comes with a big price tag. Try Purifying Cleanser, £66 (125ml): I’d have sworn this wasn’t my bag, but two years on my love remains strong. A herbal, almost medicinal-smelling no-foam face wash for oily, spotty and problem skins, but it’s gentle and non-drying on everyone. 33 La Bouche Rouge (vg) A lot of money for a little luxury, sure, but there’s no denying this is a great idea. Pick a handstitched, refillable leather case (genuine or vegan) and a lipstick finish (satin, matte or balm), choose any colour from the existing lineup or from a vast Pantone library, give it a name and the whole thing arrives in a stunning recycled cardboard presentation box, complete with vegan lipstick refill, in the post. A big investment, but a lifelong purchase and heirloom. Try Lipstick Case, £90 (refills £32): the gift for the beauty nerd who has everything. Watch for collaborations with top makeup artists. 34 Le Labo (vg) This hip perfumery brand has always offered refills on its fragrances. Return empty bottles to counters to be cleaned and refilled, for 20% less than the original. Gift boxes and bags are made from recycled cardboard. Try Labdanum 18, £127 (50ml – buy samples for £4): Santal 33 may be its most popular fragrance, but this is my favourite. Musky, with cinnamon, wood and vanilla; baby powdery but refreshing; warm but not claggy, a little masculine but not macho. Smells pretty great on everyone, in fact. 35 La Mer As one would expect from a brand using biofermented sea kelp, La Mer’s charitable focus is on the sea. Its Blue Heart Oceans Fund has donated more than £4m to conservation projects. Its bestselling Crème de La Mer – the original It cream – is packaged in glass. Try Hydrating Illuminator, £60 (40ml): a gorgeous cream for plumping up skin and leaving an almost pearlescent glow. Perfect as a pre-foundation primer or worn alone. Big brands doing better 36 Giorgio Armani In 2010, the brand developed its Acqua for Life initiative, which supports Unicef’s efforts to ensure children have safe, clean water and has invested nearly £7m in projects worldwide, bringing water to more than 195,000 people. Try Luminous Silk Foundation, £42 (30ml): this dewy finish, medium coverage liquid base for normal to dry skin is among the best of all time. If you’re oilier, try its Maestro. 37 Simple Britain’s bestselling skincare line, with 9m products sold a year, will by the end of this year become the first major mainstream skincare brand to switch all its bottles to 100% PCR. Try Water Boost Micellar Cleansing Water, £6.99 (400ml): in my view, Simple makes the best micellar water on the market. It removes even heavy eye makeup quickly and efficiently, without leaving skin irritated or parched. It’s also the bestselling and among the cheapest. 38 Clarins The brand is involved in the Plastic Odyssey challenge, which will see a boat, powered by plastic waste collected on its voyage, visit three continents to highlight plastic waste in the oceans, while educating communities about the potential to recycle plastics into fuel. Clarins’ new Paris HQ is certified by two environmental agencies; on its roof, three hives house 160,000 bees. Try Blue Orchid Treatment Oil, £34 (30ml): one of my favourite products, this is a treat for dehydrated skin, and packaged in glass. 39 L’Oréal Professionnel I’ve been waiting 10 years for L’Oréal to produce a 100% natural, permanent colourant containing no PPD, PTD, ammonia or peroxide. The three herbal ingredients in vegan Botanēa are responsibly and fairly sourced from India; the jar packaging is 50% PCR, then refilled from paper sachets, reducing waste by 74%. Try Botanēa hair colour, prices vary according to salon: glossy, healthy, cruelty-free colour, in any natural shade from pale blond to dark brown. PPD allergics can almost rejoice: it blends, rather than covers, greys. Skin test remains essential. 40 Origins Its Return to Origins recycling scheme invites customers to take empty packaging from any brand to UK counters, to be washed, shredded and transformed into plastic pellets, which can be used in anything from new packaging to street signs. The scheme has processed more than 1.2 tonnes of empties since 2010. Try GinZing Energy-Boosting Tinted Moisturiser SPF40, £32 (50ml): a brilliant day cream for adding colour, covering blemishes, protecting against UV and restoring perkiness. • If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",https://media.guim.co.uk/840f1ff2ab6346abea3621576da4c80684b8a48c/0_1126_3496_2097/500.jpg,0.18295750545750555
12,article,environment/2019/jun/02/candidate-run-global-food-body-not-defend-eu-stance-on-gm,Environment,2019-06-02,Candidate to run global food body will 'not defend' EU stance on GM,https://gu.com/p/btgz9,News,Candidate to run global food body will 'not defend' EU stance on GM,<p>Catherine Geslain-Lanéelle tells US she would be more open to its interests in UN role</p>,919,"Europe’s candidate to run the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), which guides policymakers around the world, has promised the US she will “not defend the EU position” in resisting the global spread of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). In a bid for US support, Catherine Geslain-Lanéelle told senior US officials at a meeting in Washington on 15 May that under her leadership the FAO would be more open to American interests and accepting of GMOs and gene editing, according to a US official record of the meeting seen by the Guardian. The issue has been a longstanding point of conflict in trade talks with the EU, which has adopted a far more cautious approach to biotechnology in food and agriculture. All GMO imports are subject to strict safety assessments imposed on a case-by-case basis. Plants and animals whose genome has been manipulated through gene editing are deemed to be GMOs and are subject to similar restrictions. The US portrays such restrictions as trade barriers and has demanded they be dropped. In the meeting with officials from the US agriculture and state departments, Geslain-Lanéelle, a former director general of the French agriculture and food ministry who also ran the European Food Safety Authority, signalled she would veer to the US side if she ran the FAO. “She is proud to be European, who she is, and where she comes from; however, she will promote FAO from a global perspective rather than with European Union or French views,” said a US government internal memo. “She will not defend the EU position on biotechnology and genetically modified organisms. This is not what agriculture needs. She will defend a global project that includes US interests.” The American team at the meeting was led by Ted McKinney, a Donald Trump appointee as undersecretary for trade and foreign agricultural affairs, who spent more than three decades working for agrochemical, biotechnology and animal feed companies. McKinney told Geslain-Lanéelle that “things are terribly skewed in the wrong direction” against biotechnology. “We are concerned about European pushes to ban glyphosate and cut herbicides,” he said. Glyphosate is a herbicide sold as Roundup, which the International Agency for Research on Cancer has found to be “probably carcinogenic to humans”. According to the US memo, Geslain-Lanéelle responded by saying a diversity of solutions was needed and that it was important they be science-based. The French candidate also promised to hire a US deputy director if she won the top job, in a contest to be decided at the end of June. In the meeting with US officials, Geslain-Lanéelle said she had taken the same position in public in front of the EU and was “reiterating her public commitment”. Asked for comment about Geslain-Lanéelle’s offer to Washington, her campaign manager at the French agriculture ministry, Hervé Durand, and the French embassy in Washington pointed to public remarks she had made when candidates put their case to a FAO plenary meeting in April. “Biotechnology is also very useful,” she said at the April meeting. “I will support biotechnologies, of course, including GMO and gene editing. I think it’s important.” The remarks have a more measured tone than the version presented to the US, but are significantly more pro-GMO than her main rival for the job, the Chinese candidate, Qu Dongyu. When challenged on his views by a US representative at the April plenary, Qu said he wanted to answer the concerns of civil society and the public about the technologies. Qu added: “We have to be careful, or responsible, for any new products, not only GMO, other products for pesticide, for chemicals, even for fertilisers. We have to consider their biosafety, their environment influence.” At a time of climate emergency, the FAO’s importance, as the agency charged with tackling hunger and ensuring global food security, has grown. It pools and circulates scientific knowledge and best practice and advises governments on policy. The US has an important say in deciding its new leader, as it provides 22% of its regular funding. Olivier De Schutter, a former UN rapporteur on the right to food and chair of the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems, said the leaked note reflected the fight between the US vision for agriculture and the European one. “It’s a battle for control of food in the world. US companies remain dominant in the biotech sector which promotes an industrialised model of agriculture and the US defends its agrochemical and seeds companies. In Europe public opinion is more and more in favour of a different agriculture that is less reliant on agrochemicals inputs,” he said. The FAO has a strategic role in setting the agenda for global agriculture. “The FAO has a very important influence because it guides what governments should prioritise, particularly in developing countries,” De Schutter said. “This shows it’s vital to have more transparency about how these appointments are made.” Timothy Wise, a senior research fellow at the Small Planet Institute and the author of a new book, Eating Tomorrow, said: “While it is certainly understandable that candidates for the leadership of the FAO would endorse the agency’s commitment to using ‘all tools in the toolbox’ to fight global hunger, it would be unfortunate if any candidate reduced his or her ambition for the agency to the low standards of the US government. “We need a forward-looking leader prepared to help shift global agriculture on to a more sustainable path while respecting nations’ sovereign right to determine how they feed their residents.”",https://media.guim.co.uk/eea04bdc10681728f7dd47a15ff45efd7335e86c/0_0_3500_2100/500.jpg,0.10617896871061427

Lettuce will be grown to handle warmer, drier fields. Wheat to contain less gluten. And pigs bred to resist deadly viruses. Someday, maybe even strawberry plants whose delicate berries can be picked by machine instead of by hand. Ten years ago, such genetic changes would have been considered science fiction – or so far off into the future of breeding as to be almost unimaginable. But gene editing, particularly with a tool called Crispr-Cas9, has made it much easier and more efficient to tinker with the genomes of plants and animals. The first Crispr-edited products will begin reaching the market this year, and researchers believe it’s only a matter of time before US grocery shelves could be filled with gene-edited produce, grains and meat. The technology will be subject to stringent health and environment review, as well as labeling requirements in the EU, but not in the US. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) issued a statement last March saying it would not regulate crops whose genetic changes could have been produced with conventional breeding. The European court of justice, by contrast, ruled last summer that gene-edited crops should be regulated as GMOs. The scientific challenges have been largely settled – or at least there’s a clear path toward resolving them, according to scientists in the field. But political and social ones remain. “The questions outstanding going forward are regulatory and PR and marketing and commercial launch – the things that matter the most, obviously, outside of the science,” said Rodolphe Barrangou, a distinguished professor at North Carolina State University and editor-in-chief of the Crispr Journal. Crispr technology is still in its infancy. Short for “clustered regulatory interspersed short palindromic repeats”, Crispr was first used in cells with a nucleus only six years ago. It takes advantage of the natural immune system of bacteria to make precise cuts in the target genome. This can be used to delete a few letters, turning a gene off, or dialing it up or down, or it can force a change in the genetic alphabet, giving the plant or animal new functions. It’s not a perfect process, but it’s much more precise and easier to work with than previous gene editing techniques, according to scientists. Researchers say many of these new functions will be copied from nature, making, say, a hothouse tomato as disease-resistant as a wild one without sacrificing flavor. But others could be entirely new – and likely to raise more concern. Unlike genetic modification, gene editing doesn’t require transgenics, the movement of genes from one species to another. So, if there are dangers to GMO foods – which some, but far from all scientists believe – gene editing that simply removes genes or copies sequences from similar species is likely to be safer. Essentially, gene editing accomplishes what conventional breeding would, just more efficiently and more easily, according to Zachary Lippman, an expert in the genetics of flowering plants at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, New York. “This is a tool that creates what nature could create on its own just never got around [to] or had the opportunity to create,” he said. Lippman said Crispr is an incredibly useful tool in research, allowing him to ask new questions of the tomato plants he breeds, by fast-forwarding the research process. “The amount of genetics that we’re currently able to do has at least quintupled in the last three years,” he said. It also allows breeders, who have maximized their crops for current conditions, to now ready their crops for the challenges of climate change, said Lippman, who was recently named an investigator with the Howard Hughes medical institute. It could also upend agriculture, boosting the health, shelf life, off-season availability and transportability of fruits and vegetables, said Haven Baker, chief business officer of Pairwise, a North Carolina-based startup that uses Crispr technology both to edit large-scale crops like corn and soy, and specialty crops like berries and snackable vegetables. Baker and the company’s CEO, Tom Adams, said they would like to see berry plants modified to make them easier to pick by drone or other machine rather than by hand, bringing down labor costs and avoiding arduous work. “These are the type of questions we’re thinking about – to really use Crispr technology not to maybe solve one disease problem, but to really solve the entire industry’s problems,” Baker said. “We see this as the beginning of a 25-year cycle of innovation that will greatly improve agriculture around the world.” Although most Crispr gene editing is still taking place in labs and research greenhouses, the future he envisions isn’t far off. The first gene-edited products are expected to reach the market as soon as next year: a shelf-stable soybean oil that has less saturated fat and no dangerous trans fats, from a Minnesota-based company called Calyxt, and an improved variety of waxy corn – used as a thickener and stabilizer in many food products – from Corteva Agriscience, the agriculture division of DowDuPont. But the public and governments around the world are still unsure how to deal with gene-edited crops and livestock. Jennifer Kuzma, co-director of the Genetic Engineering and Society Center at North Carolina State University, said US consumers are willing to pay 20% more to avoid GMO foods, and nearly half of the public reports actively avoiding genetically modified ingredients and food. There hasn’t been much polling data on consumer views of gene-edited foods, because they are still so new. People may be slightly less concerned with gene edits than with swapping in genes from distant species, she said, but generally, “I think people are bothered by that human-controlled laboratory step”. She also said that she sees industry making many of the same public relations mistakes with gene editing that they made with GMOs. The industry is fighting labeling and regulation and not being as transparent as it should be about the challenges and shortcomings of gene editing, she said and wrote in a recent article. Public reaction may ultimately drive government regulation – which is not yet a settled issue. While the USDA has said it would not regulate the technology, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has suggested it might treat all intentionally edited products as drugs, which would mean heavy oversight. If strong government regulations are imposed, gene editing will be finished before it really begins, said Alison Van Eenennaam, a cooperative extension specialist at the University of California, Davis. “We can stop having this discussion because we’ll never use it. It’s just done,” she said. Van Eenennaam said she was frustrated by campaigns that unnecessarily derailed a lot of the potential of GMOs, and she sees the same thing happening again with gene editing. “It’s much easier to frighten someone about something,” she said. Others think government regulation is essential for reining in bad actors and keeping food safe. Jaydee Hanson, a senior policy analyst with the Center for Food Safety, a Washington DC-based advocacy group, wants companies to publicly release a complete genetic sequence of their Crispr products, so people can look for unintentional mutations and other problems. Now, for instance, when a potato turns green, that’s a sign it is releasing toxins and shouldn’t be eaten, he said. But if the green gene were accidentally turned off, potatoes could release toxins without the warning. Industry and some academics say these off-target effects can be managed. They happen all the time in regular breeding and always have, said Bernice Slutsky, senior vice-president of the American Seed Trade Association, a trade group. Any plant or animal is already the product of mutations from hundreds of millions of years of evolution, Lippman said. Hanson said he was also worried that with Crispr, as with many technological advances, most of the benefits will go to larger, more industrialized farms. Gene-edited seeds can be patented, meaning the farmer will have to pay more to use them, which boosts the cost to farmers as well as the sellers, Hanson said. Even changes that seem to benefit animal welfare are really about profit, Hanson said. Editing cattle genes to prevent horn growth and the need to de-horn the animals is really “about making it cheaper to have 140,000-head dairies, because it’s one more step you don’t have to take”, he said. “If you wanted to raise more humane animals, you’d raise animals like the dairy I used to work at when I was a kid – you’d have 40 animals instead of 140,000 and you’d be able to know the name of every cow.” On the flip side, Hanson acknowledges that, though he does not see evidence of it being used that way, gene editing could potentially be used to cut down on the need for pesticides. And Van Eenennaam worries that if rich countries shut down gene editing, poor countries that really need increased productivity, fewer pesticides and healthier foods won’t be able to benefit. • This article was amended 4 June 2019 because an earlier version suggested that soybean oil naturally contained trans fats.

If your budget and time are limited, here’s a good place to start<br></p>",849,"There are a variety of reasons a growing number of consumers are choosing organic foods in their weekly grocery run. Many people are wary of chemical residues frequently found in foods grown with the use of pesticides that have been tied to cancer, reproductive concerns and additional health problems. Others want to support a system that aims to protect the welfare of animals raised for poultry, pork and beef products and worry about the overuse of antibiotics. Still others choose organic because of evidence that the environmental impacts of conventional agriculture are detrimental to soil and water quality. “Organic certainly isn’t perfect but it is a huge step in the right direction,” said Illinois farmer Ben Hagenbuch, who is starting to convert his family farm to organic production. “When consumers spend their dollars on organic food they’re voting. They’re voting for change.” Organic foods often cost more than conventionally grown foods, however, and may be harder to find in every grocery store. So if your budget and time are limited, you might want to prioritize. Here’s a good place to start. Berries Annual testing by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and US Department of Agriculture (USDA) finds that non-organic strawberries regularly carry residues of many types of pesticides, including synthetic bug-killing chemicals and weedkillers. One sample of strawberries examined by USDA scientists contained residues of 22 different pesticides. The level of some residues found were so high that they would be considered illegal according to government data. An analysis by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) found that strawberries were the fresh produce item most likely to be contaminated with pesticide residue. Blackberries are also due special attention because of illegally high pesticide residue levels, according to the FDA. Other fresh fruits Conventionally produced cherries, apples and applesauce also show a high prevalence of pesticides, government data shows. Kale and spinach Non-organic salad fixings often also come with traces of potentially unhealthy pesticide residues. Though kale is widely considered a popular health food, the USDA has reported finding residues of 17 different pesticides in some kale samples. Non-organic spinach has also been found to carry residues of an insecticide called permethrin, which is linked to neurological effects in children. The USDA found the insecticide in 76% of spinach samples along with residues of different fungicides designed to kill mold and mildew. Chicken Non-organic chickens are often raised in tightly confined spaces with hundreds of other birds, causing health problems. The animals are often heavily dosed with antibiotics both because of illness and for growth promotion. The widespread use of antibiotics in poultry production has been tied to antibiotic resistance health problems in humans. Milk Some conventional dairy operators give their cows a growth hormone called recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST) or recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH) to increase milk production. The hormone has been found to cause health problems in cows, including udder infections. The illnesses in turn trigger more use of antibiotics, increasing the risk of antibiotic resistance. Oatmeal Many non-organic oat farmers spray their crops with the herbicide glyphosate shortly before harvest in order to dry out the plants. The practice, called desiccation, has been shown to leave residues of glyphosate in finished oatmeal products. One FDA scientist found glyphosate residues in several types of infant oat cereal. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen. Bread Preservatives and other additives have been found to be almost four times higher in conventional bread than in organic bread. The food additive potassium bromate is one additive often used in conventional bread to improve the rise of bread dough and to make it whiter, but it is banned in Europe and IARC classifies it a possible human carcinogen. Glyphosate is also used as a desiccant on some non-organic wheat, and residues of the weedkiller have been found in bread products. Tofu Conventional tofu typically comes from genetically modified soybeans sprayed directly with glyphosate weedkiller. Conventional soybean farmers are also increasingly using new varieties of GMO soybean seeds that are sprayed with other types of herbicides as well, leaving a weedkiller cocktail in finished foods. Hamburgers Cattle fattened on feed lots instead of grass pastures live in crowded conditions and exist on a diet typically containing genetically modified corn that has been treated with pesticides. The animals are often dosed with antibiotics to treat or prevent diseases common in conventional confinement operations, contributing to antibiotic resistance. Meat from organically raised, grass-fed cattle also generally has higher levels of healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Eggs Eggs from organically raised hens benefits those who eat them as well as those who lay them. Organic eggs come from chickens raised on a diet free from most pesticides and not confined to tight cages. Some egg producers do not adhere tightly to organic standards, however, so buyers should do their best to research their egg producer of choice.

(See 5.29pm.) A senior union official has said that Jeremy Corbyn will face a fierce backlash if Labour’s national executive committee does not propose a referendum on any Brexit deal agreed before the next general election, ITV’s Robert Peston reports. A US official has said the UK and any other western countries that adopt Huawei technology for 5G mobile phone networks risk affecting intelligence cooperation with the United States. Momentum, the youth climate strikers and Extinction Rebellion are to unite in protest outside parliament on Wednesday as Labour calls on the Conservatives to declare an environmental emergency in a parliamentary vote. A senior Conservative party official has been accused of racism after writing that an Italian-born constituency chairman was untrustworthy because “his political culture is more in keeping with Sicily than Southsea”. More than 2,500 prison staff have been subject to disciplinary action in the last five years, including for relationships with inmates, assaulting prisoners and racism, the Guardian can reveal, as the government prepares to launch a unit to tackle corruption in jails. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Tony Blair, the former Labour prime minister, have given an interesting interview to the Institute for Government on devolution and Brexit which has just been published. Here are the main points. Blair said Labour was responsible for the revival of the Conservatives in Scotland because they left a gap in the market. He said: The most interesting development in Scotland has been the decline of the Labour party and the resurgence of the Conservative party. Now, in my view that has been very simply because the Conservatives have spotted a gap in the market that Labour have left – pro-union, pro-reform … When asked if he was referring to reform of the public services, he went on: Yes. A weakness in the SNP’s position and a weakness in Labour‘s position. And therefore you’ve literally got a situation where the leader of the Conservative party in Scotland has brought the party into what, roughly, second place in the polls. He said Theresa May was wrong to say that Brexit was being blocked because MPs were opposed to it in principle. He explained: Part of the trouble that has happened for the public is that the public has just been told that parliament is standing in the way of Brexit. And it has suited the prime minister for a long period of time to play on this in order to bounce her deal through parliament in order to mobilise public opinion supposedly against an obstructive parliament stopping the will of the people. But what that has done, is it has said to the public, ‘Look, Brexit is just there to be done but, you know, these members of parliament don’t want to do it.’ Which is absolutely the opposite of the case. The truth is there are different varieties of Brexit and you have to choose one. And when you choose one it then becomes apparent what your problem is. Because your problem is there is a downside to whatever option you choose. He said MPs would only back a second referendum on Brexit when they realised that was the only way to avoid responsibility for a bad decision. He said: My point is very simple: you won’t ever get to another referendum unless it’s clear to parliament that they don’t want to take responsibility fully for the Brexit choice. If you force them to make that choice … I think they will say, ‘OK, this is what I think but you have the final say’. Because whatever choice you make… if you become like Norway it’s obvious what your problem is. You’re just a rule taker. If you decide you’re Turkey, it’s obvious what your problem is. The Turkey customs union situation would be a ridiculous thing for Britain to agree to, frankly. Or if you go to Canada, well it’s obvious what your problem is – business is going to say, ‘Ok, you can do that but it’s going to be severe disruption’, the financial service people will say, ‘Well, ok, there’s going to be significant job losses.’ All of that. Those are your choices. So when members of parliament are forced to come to a choice then I think at that point they will say, ‘Ok, this what I think but I’m not going to take the full responsibility so I’m going to share responsibility with the people’, and that allows a referendum to be a healing process. He said Brexit could increase the pressure in Northern Ireland for Irish reunification. He said: The republican community in Northern Ireland is always in favour of a united Ireland …but the nationalist community is in favour at a theoretical level, at a conceptual level, but the degree of their agitation for it is intimately connected with their perception as to whether they can achieve nationalist aspirations and the legitimatisation of nationalist feelings within the United Kingdom. If Brexit acts as a destructive force on that, then it will encourage within the nationalist community, and even within parts of the more liberal unionist community, a feeling towards a border poll that just wasn’t present during the years that I was in office. He said people were “underestimating” how hard it would be for the UK union to survive after Brexit. Brexit would fuel separatism in Scotland and Northern Ireland, he said: Are there still pressures for secession? Well, in Scotland, yes, but I still think they won’t succeed unless Brexit pushes us into a position where that kind of gets Scottish independence over the line – if you have hard Brexit, which is possible. And in Northern Ireland, without Brexit I would be very confident that the Union would stick together but again Brexit is an issue there. I don’t think there is a strong move for independence in Wales. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, has said the next Tory prime minister should continue to oppose a second Scottish independence referendum, and refuse to authorise one. In her first political interview to mark her return from maternity leave, Davidson told BBC Scotland she would want the UK government to block a new referendum for the foreseeable future – a stance already taken by Theresa May. “I’ll say no, and this prime minister and the next prime minister should say so too,” she said. Sturgeon reiterated her call for a second referendum before 2021 at the Scottish National party’s spring conference at the weekend, when she also suggested the vote could be held late next year. Pointing to opinion polls showing a slight rise in the yes vote to 47% and 49% over the weekend, Sturgeon said that if support surged because of a no-deal Brexit or the arrival of unpopular new Tory prime minister, then “no Westminster government can ever stand in the way of Scotland’s right to choose”. Sturgeon has floated the idea that Boris Johnson’s arrival as prime minister could lead to a significant bounce in support for independence. The polls show only about a fifth of Scottish voters currently want a new referendum in the next two years. Davidson is a noted critic of Johnson, but she told the BBC any of May’s successors should hold the line. Davidson returns from maternity leave after the birth of her son Finn this Friday, when she hosts the Scottish Tory conference in Aberdeen. She said: Nicola Sturgeon doesn’t agree with Nicola Sturgeon on this. Not only is she going back on the Edinburgh agreement that she signed [with David Cameron in 2012], where she said she would respect the result for a generation, the test she put down for any future referendum before the last election would be that the majority of Scots would want it. The majority of Scots don’t want this, and if they need a voice to stand up to Nicola Sturgeon, I will be that voice. Davidson admitted that watching the chaotic and tortuous Brexit process takes place from home left her thinking it “looks like a bit of a mess”. Given that, all sides needed to compromise more and secure a cross-party deal, she said. My message to colleagues both in my party and others is now is the time, instead of sticking in your trenches and hoping everyone moves to you, is to take that first step forward and start that compromise that clearly needs to happen. If the country is going to come together, it does require politicians to come together first. At the weekend BuzzFeed reported that the government is planning to charge EU students the same tuition fees as those paid by non-EU international students from 2021-22, rather than the lower fees paid by UK students as now. BuzzFeed said, although the plans had not been finalised, the intention was for EU students to pay the higher fees whether or not there was a Brexit deal. In the Commons Chris Skidmore, an education minister, has been answering an urgent question on this. In his initial statement he did not deny the story, although he insisted that no final decision had been taken. He told MPs: Discussions at cabinet level are ongoing and should remain confidential. I will make no comment on this apparent leak, which is deeply regrettable. But, as the session went on, Skidmore implied that EU students would lose their special status. He said: The economic importance of our HE [higher education] sector is reflected in the need to attract EU students, but also students from across the globe. And this is at the crux of the matter here. We want to ensure that we going forward, as a country and as a nation, are attractive internationally .... When it comes to our negotiations - I’ve spoken to around 15 European higher education ministers - we need to make sure that we commit to them that Britain remains an attractive place to come and work and study for all nations across the world. Guy Verfhofstadt, the European parliament’s lead Brexit spokesman, has written to Theresa May expressing deep concerns about the plans. This is from the Telegraph’s Steven Swinford. Here is Julian Smith, the government chief whip, arriving at the Cabinet earlier this afternoon for the latest round of Brexit talks with Labour. He is part of the government delegation, along with David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, Michael Gove, the environment secretary, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, and Gavin Barwell, the PM’s chief of staff. And here is the Labour team arriving. Extinction Rebellion (XR) says it is holding a meeting later today with Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, followed by a meeting tomorrow morning with Michael Gove, the environment secretary. Ministers from other departments will also attend. The group is also due to hold separate talks with John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, at some point tomorrow. Ahead of the Gove meeting, which XR says it will film for release to the public, Sam Knights, a member of its political strategy team, said: The legacy of our political leaders will stand or fall by what they do now. Either they take steps to give our children the future they deserve or they do nothing. They must respond to the climate and ecological emergency with the clarity and urgency our children demand. In order to protect life on earth, the UK government must begin to tell the truth. The British people need to know the reality of what we face. It is time to declare a climate and ecological emergency and to commit to reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. The current political system is not capable of implementing such fundamental changes to the way we live. That is why we need the creation of a national citizens’ assembly on climate and ecological justice. Downing Street has effectively confirmed that the ongoing Brexit deadlock has led to the next Queen’s speech being postponed. A new Queen’s speech, introducing a new session of parliament, had been expected early this summer, but the prime minister’s spokesman told reporters this morning that the government wanted to get the EU withdrawal agreement bill, “part of the current Queen’s speech cycle”, through parliament first. He said: What we are focused on is the withdrawal agreement bill [WAB], because that is the legislation which is necessary in order to ratify our withdrawal from the EU. That is part of the current Queen’s speech cycle and we need to finish that work. The spokesman also confirmed that a team from the government, led by David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, will meet a Labour team this afternoon for the latest round of talks in the attempt to reach a cross-party compromise on Brexit. This is the main forum where the talks have been taking place. The spokesman said that the discussions so far have been serious and that it was possible that the working groups, which have been looking at issues like workers’ rights and the environment, could meet again later this week. But he also said that there were no plans for Theresa May to meet Jeremy Corbyn, and he refused to say how long the government would wait before concluding that the two sides will not be able to reach agreement. The Labour MPs behind the parliamentary drive for a confirmatory referendum on Brexit have written to their party’s governing body urging it to use the European elections to campaign for a fresh poll regardless of whether a deal has been reached with the government. Victims of rape and serious sexual assault who refuse to give police access to their mobile phone contents could allow suspects to avoid charges, two top officials have said. Asked if the government backed the plans to ask victims to surrender their phones, the prime minister’s spokesman told journalists: We want victims to have the confidence to come forward and report crimes knowing that they will get the support they need and that everything will be done to bring offenders to justice. Clearly, this is a complex area and, while disclosure is an important component of the criminal justice system, to ensure a fair trial, the police have acknowledged that the use of personal data in criminal investigations is a source of anxiety and that they understand the need to balance a respect for privacy with the need to pursue all reasonable lines of inquiry. The police and the CPS will work with victims and the Information Commissioner’s Office to ensure that the right approach is being taken. Each police force will also conduct its own impact assessment of the forms as they are rolled out. Pascal Lamy, the former head of the World Trade Organisation, has dismissed Brexiter claims about how alternative customs arrangements could avoid the need for a hard border in Ireland after Brexit as “pie in the sky”. (See 1.34pm.) The leading Tory Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg has defended the leak of the national security council decision about the government planning to let Huawei play a role in building parts of the UK’s 5G infrastructure, saying it was in the national interest. (See 11.01am.) Social care provision should be modelled on the state pension, with taxpayers funding a flat-rate “universal care entitlement”, which patients could supplement from their own funds, according to former Conservative cabinet minister Damian Green. On the BBC’s Politics Live earlier this afternoon Iain Duncan Smith, the Tory Brexiter and former party leader, had a debate about post-Brexit border controls with Pascal Lamy, the former head of the World Trade Organisation. Duncan Smith is one of the many Brexiters who believe the backstop is unnecessary because “alternative arrangements” could ensure the need for no hard border in Ireland after Brexit. After he made this point on the programme, Lamy told him this was “pie in the sky”. He said: With respect, I was director general of the World Trade Organisation for eight years, which has something to do with customs procedures. And this notion that exiting the internal market implies no border is pie in the sky. There is no way you can exit the internal market without a border. Duncan Smith said alternative arrangements worked perfectly well at a port like Rotterdam. They inspect less than 2% of imports, and not at the border, he said. He said he had witnessed this himself, and he went on: The reality is technology now means the idea of barriers and borders is long gone. But Lamy, again, told him he was wrong. This is how the conversation continued. PL: I’m sorry, this is a total confusion .... between the internal market and the customs union. The customs union is about tariffs, goods. The internal market is about regulation. If you want to diverge ... you have to accept that there will be a border because we, the EU, have to control things which abide by different regulatory requirements. IDS: Of course, but you would work on the principle of two things. First is equivalence ... PL: Equivalence is not a magic wand. IDS: No, it’s not, but take what New Zealand does with the EU. New Zealand is not a member of the EU. It is not a member of the single market. Its food stuffs are not inspected here because, why? They trust and agree that in New Zealand the inspections that bring their standards right are at the same level or better than that of the EU. And they agree that that is done at the point of departure. They are not done at the border. So the idea of this being a border point is completely incorrect. PL: No, no, no, it is not completely incorrect, I’m sorry. I agree, if you want trade to flow as nicely as possible, many customs procedures have to be moved upstream. But you still need a border to check that this is the case. IDS: The border is not the point. PL: Of course it is. IDS: The border is a notional process that is about equivalence and agreement, not specific border checks. PL: Equivalence is not a magic wand. You only accept equivalence if you trust, and if your collective preferences are harmonised. I agree, for instance, on beer, there is nothing that really says how you produce beer in the European Union. There is beer in Belgium and in Bavaria and in Scotland, and if beer is good for Scotland, it is good for Bavaria. Now, that is okay. It is not going to be okay about general food, or about chlorinated poultry. I’m sorry about that. We will not accept GMO food. If - I don’t know whether or not - if you want to accept chlorinated poultry or GMO food, there will be a border, and costs at the border. Lamy’s hand gestures were even more expressive. Yesterday my colleague Severin Carrell reported that Kezia Dugdale, the former Scottish Labour leader, was about to announce that she will resign from the Scottish parliament to take a job outside politics. Dugdale has now released a statement confirming this. And she has announced that she is leaving Holyrood to become director of the John Smith Centre for Public Service at Glasgow University. Explaining her move Dugdale said: I have devoted my working life to public service, and this is an incredibly exciting new opportunity for me to lead the work of the John Smith Centre. Throughout my career I have taken on tough and challenging tasks, and my next task is to rebuild faith in our politics. Disruptive events and the rise of populism has led to increasingly polarised and emotional politics where rational, evidence-based thinking has lost its standing.“Faith in public service, politics and the political process has to be restored and that progress must be sustainable. John Smith said ‘the opportunity to serve our country - that is all we ask’. It will be an honour to build on his legacy and inspire his values of public service in a new generation. More on tomorrow’s meeting of Labour’s national executive committee. This is from Jon Lansman, the founder of Momentum, the pro-Corbyn Labour organisation, and a member of the party’s national executive committee. I’m just back from the Downing Street lobby briefing. It was not hugely informative, but this was probably the best line. Downing Street effectively confirmed that the next Queen’s speech has been postponed. The last Queen’s speech, setting out the government’s legislative agenda, was in June 2017, with the session of parliament due to last two-years, because of Brexit, instead of the usual one year. That meant a new Queen’s speech had been due this summer. But at the lobby briefing the prime minister’s spokesman refused to say when the next one would be. And he confirmed that the government wanted to get the EU withdrawal agreement bill, “part of the current Queen’s speech cycle”, through parliament first. But he could not even say when that bill would be introduced. The question about the Queen’s speech was prompted by this story from Francis Elliott in today’s Times (paywall). It starts: Theresa May is scrambling to find legislation to keep MPs busy over the summer so that she can delay a potentially fatal Queen’s Speech until the autumn. The parliamentary session is already on course to be the longest in postwar history but the prime minister lacks the authority to start a new term. Passing a Queen’s speech is a minimum constitutional requirement of a viable government. Cabinet sources admit that the bill that implements Brexit is the last significant piece of legislation in the locker. Mrs May dare not introduce it, however, as she fears that it will be rejected by MPs, forcing her to end the session. Instead, Downing Street has drawn up a list of relatively benign legislation to justify extending the session beyond the original two-year deadline due in June. It includes bills to change the tax treatment of sporting testimonials and increase the maximum sentences for cases of animal cruelty. Others under consideration in No 10 include measures to address domestic abuse and increase tenants’ rights. My colleague Rowena Mason wrote something similar earlier this month. The Tory Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg hosted his LBC phone-in earlier. Brexit came up, of course, but on other topics (Shamima Begum and government secrecy) Rees-Mogg revealed his inner Guardian reader. Here are the main points. Rees-Mogg criticised Sajid Javid, the home secretary’s decision to strip Shamima Begum of her British citizenship. And he said it was right that Begum, who left the UK as a schoolgirl to join Islamic State in Syria, should be receiving legal aid. He explained: I have been very concerned about the removal of her citizenship. I think she is a British responsibility. And I believe that she is correctly given legal aid, that we have a principle of innocence until proved guilty in this country and I think that taking away a passport by purely administrative act, with no judicial oversight, is not just. Rees-Mogg told the caller who asked about this issue that on this he was at odds with the views of most of his colleagues. He said: You are assuming that I have the views that most Eurosceptics and most Conservatives do have. But this is one of the views I don’t have in common with a lot of people I agree with on other things. I believe that a British citizenship ought to be protected, and that means that you have the full protection of the law. And if you have committed an offence, you can be charged. But you are our responsibility, not Bangladesh’s responsibility. Jeremy Corbyn has also said that it is right for Begum to get legal aid, but generally Conservative MPs have found it much harder to defend this decision. For example, Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said that although Begum was entitled to legal aid, this was something that made him personally “very uncomfortable”. Rees-Mogg defended the leak of the national security council decision about the government planning to let Huawei play a role in building parts of the UK’s 5G infrastructure and he criticised the government’s response to what happened. He told the programme: When politicians talk about criminal inquiries, it usually means they have done something wrong and they want to cover it up. The whole story here is not about a leak. It is about whether or not we are getting into bed with a Chinese company, Huawei, against the advice of the US and the Australians who have decided not to. This is a fundamental issue of national security. It is really, really important at that level. Whether somebody mentioned it in passing and leaked it is trivial in comparison. This is not, in terms of the leak, about national security. It is about national security in terms of the decision. And what worries me is that the cabinet secretary [Sir Mark Sedwill], who is getting very excited about the leak, is focusing on the wrong issue. He said the leak was in the national interest. When it was put to him that people should not leak from the national security council, he said: You can’t say that everything in a meeting is of the same level of security. Some things are, and some things aren’t. Some things are made public. We didn’t used to know who the head of MI5 was, or MI6. It all used to be kept very quiet. Now the government wields them out when it is convenient .... They use the secret services as part of the propaganda machine when convenient. And when it’s something they don’t like, suddenly it’s national security and people can have two years in prison. Knowing that we are doing this with Huawei is really important, potentially an issue of deep national security. And, actually the fact that we know that is a good thing, and the journalist who reported it deserves an award for journalistic endeavour. He said sometimes leaking secrets could be justified. Asked if it was acceptable to leak secrets, he said: Well, it’s obviously okay to leak some secrets. That must be true. Think of all the secrets given to Winston Churchill in the 1930s, in relation to re-armament in Germany and the speed of aircraft production in Germany, which were incredibly useful in answering the appeasers, and of course which the government then was very against. Because the government doesn’t like secrets that are embarrassing to it being revealed. Rees-Mogg criticised reports that cabinet ministers will be asked to surrender their phones as part of the inquiry. He said: And I’m afraid I don’t approve of cabinet minsters being told to hand over their telephones. I think in this country we have a principle that you are innocent until proved guilty. And that making widespread investigation, without evidence on specific figures, seems to me to be wrong. And cabinet ministers deserve similar protections to everyone else. Asked if he would hand over his phone for an inquiry like this if he were a cabinet minister, he said: I would instinctively refuse. I don’t think the cabinet secretary has the right. He does not have police powers. And I don’t think our senior political figures should be treated in this way. They are privy counsellors. They have take oaths of loyalty to the Queen ... The police can investigate. The police have different powers. But the cabinet secretary is not a constable. He does not have that warrant. Rees-Mogg said that Robert Hayward’s claims that the Tories could lose 800 seats in the local elections (see 9.34am) were “realistic”. Talking about his own experience out campaigning for the locals, he said: I got the feeling that quite a number of people are staying with us, but quite a number of people are probably going to stay at home. He said he agreed with Boris Johnson in urging people not to use the local elections to vote on Brexit. (See 9.34am.) He said: People, I hope, will think as they go to the polling stations that this is about their council tax, it is about their bin collection, it is about their road maintenance. It’s not about Brexit. I completely understand why people are fed up with the Tories over Brexit. We haven’t had any proper leadership, it’s been indecisive and weak, and we’ve been led by the nose by the European Union. That’s not what these elections are about. And it would be very sad if very good councillors lost because of Brexit-related muddle. But he said he was not convinced that this was realistic. It is a slightly pious hope because we know that people in elections vote more on national than on local issues. He dismissed suggestions that a massive defeat for the Tories in the election could force Theresa May out of office. When this was put to him, he replied: Well, the rules of the Conservative party are that she is in place and there cannot be a vote against her until December, and the prime minister is very capable of staying in post. He defended the decision of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee last week not to change the rules to allow an early no confidence vote in May. He said: I was sympathetic to the decision not to change the rules. We are British, after all, and changing the rules half way through never looks particularly fair. That does not exclude the prime minister deciding of her own accord that the time is up. I’m off to the lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30am. Back to the local elections, and Jeremy Corbyn has been tweeting about them too. Like Boris Johnson (see 9.34am), he is urging people to vote on local issues, not on Brexit. Here is my colleague Jessica Elgot and the Daily Mirror’s Pippa Crerar on what might happen when Labour’s national executive committee meets tomorrow to decide what to say about a referendum in the party’s manifesto for the European elections. Boris Johnson, the Brexiter former foreign secretary and a leading candidate to replace Theresa May, has used his column in the Daily Telegraph (paywall) this morning to offer a counter view. He says that he has been out campaigning for the local elections and that he has heard how angry people are about Brexit. But he thinks people will, and should, vote on local issues, he says. I have rung bells, patted dogs, admired wisteria, wolfed samosas – and in return I have been given some pretty frank opinions about the state of politics. I have come to a tentative conclusion. This may be too optimistic, and I may be proved wrong – but I am starting to think that people can make a crucial distinction at this election on May 2. Whatever they may think about what is going on at Westminster – and our current dismal failure to leave the EU – they can see that there is no point in taking out their frustrations on effective and hard-working Tory councillors. Johnson’s view is not shared by other Conservatives. Here is the Sunday Express headline from yesterday. That may look like hyperbole and expectation management, but, as my colleague Heather Stewart reports, the psephologist and Tory peer Robert Hayward is saying the Conservatives could lose 800 seats at the local elections on Thursday. Hayward is respected as an expert in this field, and he has no interest in making predictions that turn out to look foolish. Unfortunately the Telegraph article does not make it clear whether Johnson’s claim that the Tories will do better that expected in the local elections represents his serious, considered view or whether this is another example of Johnson being “clearly comically polemical” in a way that “could not be reasonably read as a serious, empirical, in-depth analysis of hard factual matters” - to quote the Telegraph’s own description of his journalism, in a statement to the Independent Press Standards Organisation in response to a complaint (upheld) about Johnson making a false claim about Brexit polling in a column earlier this year. It is 29 April. A month ago today was the day when the UK was supposed to leave the EU. A month on, not only is the UK still a fully signed-up member, but the government is no closer than it was to finding a Brexit outcome that has any chance of passing parliament. This ought to be a cause of outright panic at Westminster but in recent days the Brexit conversation has gone reasonably quiet and, reportedly, that is partly because Conservatives have been told to pipe down on this subject in the run-up to the local elections on Thursday. According to Glen Owen and Harry Cole in the Mail on Sunday yesterday: Downing Street aides are also urging all ministers and MPs to avoid the airwaves to ‘bang on about Brexit’ in the next four days – or face being blamed for worsening an expected local elections drubbing on Thursday. A No 10 source said: ‘Word has gone out to shut up for a few days. There is a direct correlation between us arguing on television and people getting fed up, so we are hoping to avoid that on the eve of the polls.’ But not every Tory has got the memo. On the BBC’s Westminster Hour last night, Priti Patel, the Brexiter former international development secretary, said the party would do badly at the locals because of the failure to deliver Brexit. She explained: I think without a doubt that frustration is there. I have heard it myself. I’ve experienced it both with my council candidates and when I’ve been on the doorstep … The mood is dark. The public are frustrated. They are fed up I think more widely with politics and the way in which Brexit has been handled and in particular the fact that, as many people say to me in my constituency, they expected us to leave effectively on the 29th of March. This has not happened. They are also very unhappy with the tactics and antics of Westminster politicians, for example, taking no deal off the table, indicative votes and really I think it’s fair to say the sort of anti-democratic way in which the House of Commons has behaved against the referendum mandate. And in a column in the Daily Telegraph (paywall) this morning, John Redwood, another Brexiter, says the failure to deliver Brexit will harm his party. Many voters feel let down by both main parties, who promised to take us out of the EU but who have conspired to keep us in for longer. The polling for the European elections shows Labour and the Conservatives on a combined 37 per cent or so, under half their level of support of less than two years ago. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP and chair of the European Research Group, which represents Tories who want a harder Brexit, holds his LBC phone-in. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. Afternoon: Talks resume between Labour and the government in the search for a Brexit compromise.

Howard Schultz’s Seattle behemoth has co-branded a new Iced Caramel Cloud Macchiato, meant to distil the unique personality of Ariana Grande down to its caffeine constituents. According to the coffee phrenologists who wrote the press release, it turns out Ariana is “an espresso shot with milk, with fluffy foam on top”, available in caramel or cinnamon flavour. However, as quickly as the public could gawp at this transubstantiation of celebrity into beans, the Ariana Grande Iced Caramel Cloud Macchiato began to leak cred. It is not vegan. Which shouldn’t be a problem, except that Ariana is a vegan, so she can’t drink her own drink. Still, even if the first one’s a flop, the concept is exciting. The signature sneaker was flogged to death years ago, but the signature beverage represents a real breakthrough moment for coffee marketing: their equivalent of what gene therapy probably is to medicine. So, what other coffees could be moulded around stars? AOC In a little over a year, New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) has become a blazing Roman candle in the sky of social justice.

Be it in The Hangover, American Sniper or A Star Is Born, Bradley is a reassuringly bland lump of all-American stodge. And he’s always ready to be poured into any mould you like by producers who couldn’t find Chris Pratt’s number. Bradley is an American icon of visible invisibility, the perfect leading man for our times, with his spot-on combo of over-fitness and twinkly eyed, unthreatening demeanour.

17,article,environment/2019/apr/16/super-plants-climate-change-joanne-chory-carbon-dioxide,Environment,2019-04-17,This scientist thinks she has the key to curb climate change: super plants,https://gu.com/p/b6dp6,News,This scientist thinks she has the key to curb climate change: super plants,"<p>Dr Joanne Chory hopes that genetic modifications to enhance plants’ natural carbon-fixing traits could play a key role – but knows that time is short, for her and the planet</p>",2278,"If this were a film about humanity’s last hope before climate change wiped us out, Hollywood would be accused of flagrant typecasting. That’s because Dr Joanne Chory is too perfect for the role to be believable. The esteemed scientist – who has long banged the climate drum and now leads a project that could lower the Earth’s temperature – is perhaps the world’s leading botanist and is on the cusp of something so big that it could truly change our planet. She’s also a woman in her 60s who is fighting a disease sapping her very life. In 2004, Chory was diagnosed with Parkinson’s, which makes the timetable for success all the more tenuous. “We’re trying to do something that’s a huge, complicated thing even though it sounds so simple,” Chory says. “Plants evolved to suck up CO2 and they’re really good at it. And they concentrate it, which no machine can do, and they make it into useful materials, like sugar. They suck up all the CO2, they fix it, then it goes back up into the atmosphere.” She is now working to design plants capable of storing even more carbon dioxide in their roots. Her Ideal Plant project uses gene editing – via traditional horticulture and Crispr – to do so. On a large scale, this could suck enough carbon out of the atmosphere to slow down climate change. This concept basically splices the genes of regular crops and everyday plants like beans, corn and cotton, with a new compound that makes them absorb more carbon. Their roots then transfer it to the soil to keep it there. This approach essentially supercharges what nature already does. “I get worked up when I talk about the project,” Chory tells me in an office at the Salk Institute, a revered bio research campus at the edge of the Pacific Ocean in southern California. Her desk is full of posies, awards, family photos and framed magazine covers from science journals. “We have to find a way to take CO2 out of the atmosphere and I think plants are the only way to do that affordably,” Chory says. “I feel like I have the weight of the world on my shoulders,” she says, letting out a laugh. “It is a lot of pressure.” Born in Boston to Lebanese parents, the third of six children, Chory received a PhD studying photosynthetic bacteria at the University of Illinois. She spent her postdoctoral years as a Harvard Medical School researcher, then joined the institute in 1988. Along the way, she’s discovered how plants respond to everything from light and environment to how they regulate size and growth. “It’s a philosophical issue, too,” she says, explaining why so many kick the can of global warming. “If I take pain now, maybe my great-grandchildren might see a benefit. People choose no pain now, that’s why we’ve done nothing about climate change.” Every now and then as we speak, Chory’s symptoms pop up like an uninvited guest, another stark reminder of time. Struggling to maintain control and ever aware of the implied humor in her movements, she doesn’t shy from the elephant in the room. “When I get excited I really get moving,” she mock-apologizes, letting out a coy chuckle. “I’m a lot better on Saturdays.” She pauses, collects her thoughts. “That’s why I want to do something that won’t cause pain to people. You never know when you’re making a global change. I don’t know if we can do it, but we have to try.” An ‘even if’ scenario Temperatures are already at alarming levels even if we reach the Paris agreement of curbing a rise of 2C. The world is headed for major upheaval, it’s merely a question of the scale. If we have any chance as a species, Salk contends, it’s with big ideas like this. Right now, the institute is negotiating with seed companies and prepping tests on nine agricultural crops to introduce Ideal Plants on farms around the world. Field-testing begins later this year with wheat, soybeans, corn and cotton. Developing these Ideal Plants is step one in the Harnessing Plants Initiative, which amplifies root systems and production of suberin – which is essentially cork, or the rind on your cantaloupe, the magic key to plants holding more of that carbon – before transferring these genetic traits to row and cover crops. Given the right resources, and funding, prototypes of each crop are expected to be ready in the next five years. A $2m gift by Howard Newman, a Salk board member and private equity veteran who has invested in oil and gas, jump-started the project last June. In April, Salk received a TED Audacious grant totaling $35m to support the plan. Chory says these new plants will have deeper and stronger root systems that will also stop erosion, another byproduct of warming temperatures, which will make soil more healthy and boost production. When normal plants die, they release large amounts of CO2 back into the air; when Ideal Plants die, significantly less CO2 will be re-released due to more carbon being stored in deeper roots and soil for longer periods, and suberin’s natural ability as a carbon polymer to resist short-term decomposition. The first two meters of the Earth’s soil holds over three times the amount of carbon as the atmosphere, and can hold even more. Fossil fuel use was predicted to rise nearly 2% last year. Each year, we produce 18 more gigatons of CO2 than the Earth can currently handle; Salk believes their solution can achieve as much as a 46% annual reduction in excess CO2 emissions produced by humans. It’s an extremely ambitious idea full of so many unknowns – how to get global buy-in from farmers, how many years will it take for plants to reach maturity and will it then be too late, how will mother nature react to such genetic modification and how will these crops taste – that none of Salk’s brains have the answers to. The institute was founded in 1960 by Jonas Salk, a biologist who discovered the cure for polio in 1955, two years before my own father’s identical twin died of the disease in communist Romania, a place where politics kept science at bay. Standing at the edge of the seaside campus designed by Louis Kahn, a sprawl of ominous cement towers and dramatic ocean views, it all feels straight out of the mind of Philip K Dick. Part Gattaca, part Logan’s Run, it’s easy to see why numerous films have been shot here. But there’s also an optimism in these labs that feels so far from the stark structures and climate narrative I’m used to. Many scientists have told me their role is something akin to historian, documenting the last days of a species or system. Not so here. “There is hope in dreams, in imagination and in the courage of those who dare to make dreams into reality,” Jonas Salk once said. Inside these modernist blocks, they’re dreamers too, but rooted in reality. The biological research center, funded by government grants and private donors, has spent decades inching towards cures for everything from cancer to Alzheimer’s. In 1968, Robert W Holley, Salk Cancer Center’s founding director, won a Nobel prize; in 1975, Institute staff won another Nobel, and again in 1977 and 2002. More recently, Chory was awarded a $3m breakthrough prize for discovering how plants optimize their growth, development and cellular structure to transform sunlight into chemical energy. I see the optimism on a tour with Dr Joseph Noel, a biochemist focused on harnessing suberin, the project’s linchpin. He shows me seed-planting robots, which can bang out a day’s work in the time it would take a human weeks; state-of-the-art grow rooms capable of simulating almost any environmental condition; greenhouses sitting atop dramatic bluffs. All the while he breaks down the importance of cork. “It’s a spongy barrier that helps a plant regulate water coming in and out, gas exchange coming in and out. Think of it like a protective plastic around certain cells in the plant.” The institute’s founder, Jonas, once said “our greatest responsibility is to be good ancestors,” and I think about the quote’s relevance as Noel shows me rows of simulation rooms full of cattails, marsh grasses, Lotus japonicus legumes and weed-like Arabidopsis thaliana, all in various states of growth as LEDs shine and humid air blasts while I take notes. “Instead of just growing in a greenhouse or artificial lights in a lab, we wanted to have the ability to simulate a particular climactic zone: quality of light, seasonal changes, cloud cover, temperatures,” Noel says. Since Arabidopsis “can go from seed to seed in six weeks” and its genome is entirely sequenced and resembles so many other species, the little mustard flower has become the project’s veritable Rosetta Stone. “It’s very easy to change the genetics of it on a massive scale,” he continues. “If we change a particular gene, we can find out if the roots get deeper, do they get more extensive, does the suberin content change. Their early ancestors have been doing photosynthesis for about 2.8bn years.” Without plants, life as we know it wouldn’t exist. The question is whether these ones will become our saviors. Genetically modified plants remain a tough sell There’s a growing field of carbon dioxide removal projects which include machines pulling C02 out of the sky, known as direct air capture. There’s Bill Gates-backed Carbon Engineering and the Zurich startup Climeworks, and about 20 commercial carbon capture and storage facilities worldwide, but they’re price prohibitive. There have been notable failures: Sir Richard Branson tried a $25m prize for carbon removal but never found a solution. Carbon removal initiatives are also criticized for preserving the status quo and big energy business models. “Ultimately, we all know that humanity’s response to climate change will, as the Ideal Plant project states, make or break our future,” says David Stern, the president and CEO of the Boyce Thompson Institute, a leading plant research facility in New York, who calls Chory a fearless, creative and open-minded scientist. “Given the complexities and scale of the problem, many types of solutions will be needed. Sequestration is undoubtedly one of them.” One big problem, Stern notes, is winning hearts and minds. Genetically modifying organisms saving the planet might be a tough sell in an era when GMO has become the antithesis for the green, organic movement. “While they are not proposing traditional transgenic lines nor are they proposing to do their work in food crops, the issue will still come up,” Stern adds. Chory maintains that plants have been modified for millennia – selecting the best strains to cultivate and taking a hand in their development is a form of genetic modification, after all – and the nutritional and yield values of such tweaked products still outweigh the drawbacks. Salk doesn’t introduce foreign genetic material in its plants, unlike many GMO products. The European Union outlawing modified organisms, plus crops with Crispr traits (as a result, the plants might not make it to the EU). Another issue is seed pricing and getting it to farmers around the world, so the wide-scale use is in question. “As with any GMO crop the big question is how do the changes affect nutritional quality and whether small farmers in developing countries would be able to buy the seeds on a large enough scale to make a difference?” wonders Dan Wenny, a senior biologist who studies land-bird seed dispersal at the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory. Right now, the Mississippi delta in Louisiana is a test zone for a first batch of Ideal Plants in the wild, a major step to see if improved root systems can mitigate sea level rise. Still, Salk researchers are sober to the odds. “Any restoration effort, unlike our Arabidopsis that can grow from seed to seed in six weeks, these systems you plant them and then you wait. You wait a long time,” Noel laments. “We can’t afford to have these experiments not work.” Are we past the point of no return? “The world’s not going to be the world we live in right now,” Chory says. “I don’t know if we’re going to eliminate the whole human species, but I think if we don’t do something soon we will go that route. The misery index of humidity plus the heat will get so high mammals can’t live.” The Union of Concerned Scientists says the tipping point is here. “I don’t think it’s here yet,” Chory counters. Still, she concedes that “migration is already happening. Canada is going to make out well in this. The United States is not. We’re going to have a lot of changes in our agriculture.” She adds: “The farmers are the ones we really have to convince. We can’t continue to farm the way we farm any more. It can feed 8 to 10 billion people but 50 years from now, there won’t be any good soil left so you’re just putting the disaster off.” Chory glances at a picture of her daughter, Katie. “Look at me, I’m 64 years old. I’m not going to be around to see this project go to fruition, I’m not going to be working at Salk, probably. That urgency is there. The climate urgency is there. Every week there’s a new climate disaster. How can we get there? We can’t really get there any faster. I don’t know if we can do it, but I want to be part of the solution. I don’t just want to sit around and complain.” Adam Popescu is a Los Angeles writer.

Gaps appeared on grocery shelves. Coffee shops put out signs, turning customers away. Twitter and Instagram brimmed with outrage. The truly desperate searched from Williamsburg to Harlem, but it seemed undeniable: New York was out of oat milk. It wasn’t just New York, in fact. The entire US was suffering from a shortage of Oatly, a Swedish plant milk whose rapid rise from obscure digestive health brand to the dairy alternative of choice had caught even Oatly by surprise. Since its US launch in 2016, Oatly had gone from supplying a handful of upscale New York coffee shops to more than 3,000 cafes and grocery stores nationwide. The company had ramped up production by 1,250%, but when I spoke to CEO Toni Petersson in late summer, they were still struggling to meet demand. “How do we supply when the growth is this crazy?” Petersson said. Fortunately, when it comes to milk, in 2019 there is no shortage of alternative alternatives. Visit your local supermarket and you will find a refrigerated aisle overflowing with choice: almond milk, hazelnut milk, peanut, tiger nut, walnut, cashew – and that’s just the nuts. Coconut, hemp, spelt, quinoa, pea – you name it, somewhere a health-food startup is milking it. London tube stations are filled with ads for new plant milks – or rather, “mylks” (EU law prevents dairy alternatives from using the word milk if it isn’t produced by a lactating mammal). Cookbooks dedicate entire chapters to blending and straining your own. Sainsbury’s now stocks around 70 different options. There are the wellness punks (Rebel Kitchen, Rude Health), the dairy puns (Malk, Milkadamia, Mooala) and the nourishers (LoveRaw, Good Karma, Plenish). “People are just looking at every nut that exists and seeing if they can squash it into a milk,” said Glynis Murray, one of the owners of Good, which squashes hemp seeds into oil and milk. It seems unthinkable now, but as recently as 2008, alternatives to cow’s milk largely meant soya (invariably Alpro in the UK, Silk in the US). For anything else, you’d need to scour health-food shops for drab, clinical-looking, long-life cartons of rice milk buried in the back with the other digestive aids. “It was the deathly aisle,” said John Schoolcraft, Oatly’s global creative director. “It was just for people who were lactose intolerant [or] had an allergy to milk; vegans, vegetarians – people who, at that time, were on the fringe of society.” Plant milks are no longer fringe. Just over one in 10 of Pret a Manger’s hot drinks in the UK are ordered with dairy alternative milks (organic soya milk or organic rice-coconut milk). According to research firm Mintel, UK plant milk sales have grown by 30% since 2015, buoyed by a surge in vegan and vegetarian diets. In the US, nearly half of all shoppers now add a plant milk to their baskets. Globally, the industry is estimated to be worth $16bn. Meanwhile, reduced demand for cow’s milk and falling prices led to the closure of 1,000 dairy farms in the UK between 2013 and 2016. Milk’s reputation as a healthy food is under threat from anxieties about bovine antibiotics, animal cruelty and the industry’s environmental impact, as well as increased diagnosis of lactose intolerance. Teenagers now consider cow’s milk less healthy than plant milk alternatives, a development the former chairman of Dairy UK, David Dobbin, called “a demographic time bomb”. “Consumers are really not sure about the dairy industry,” Caroline Roux, a dairy analyst at Mintel, told me. “They’re not convinced these products are good for them any more.” But the plant milk boom is, as one entrepreneur told me, “way bigger than just switching your milk”. To converts, almond and oat milk are the next wave in a fundamental shift towards a more conscious, sustainable way of living. To critics, they’re little more than cleverly marketed nut juice with additives – a symptom of everything that’s wrong with modern food culture. And so a strange battle has emerged, between an industry trying to replace something it says we don’t need in the first place, and dairy, a business that for a century sold itself as the foundation of a healthy diet, while ignoring the fact that most of the world does just fine without it. * * * We are all born milk drinkers. Babies’ guts produce the enzyme lactase, which breaks down lactose, the sugar in breastmilk (and cow’s milk), into the simpler sugars glucose and galactose. But for the majority of humans, production of the enzyme lactase plummets after weaning. “From a human perspective – no, to go further than that, from a mammalian perspective – the norm is to be able to tolerate your mother’s breast milk, and then as you get past infancy, to stop producing lactase and become lactose intolerant,” said Adam Fox, a consultant paediatric allergist at Guy’s and St Thomas’s hospitals, and one of the UK’s leading food allergy experts. “Then you’ve got a small group of humans that have a mutation which means they maintain production of lactase into adulthood. Northern Europeans, the Masai [in east Africa], some Arab groups as well. But that’s the exception, not the rule.” That schism between milk-drinkers and the rest – actually a series of independent genetic mutations – appears to have occurred about 10,000 years ago, around the time humans were domesticating farm animals. It is the reason that in countries such as the UK, Sweden and Ireland, more than 90% of adults can drink milk without suffering any ill effects, but worldwide, more than two-thirds of all adults are considered lactose intolerant. For lactose-intolerant people, a glass of milk can induce bloating, stomach pains and diarrhoea. (Lactose intolerance should not be – though often is – confused with cow’s milk allergy, an immune response to the proteins in cow’s milk that affects around 1% of UK adults.) Even in northern Europe, milk as we know it is a recent phenomenon. Fresh milk, left unrefrigerated, spoils quickly and can harbour a variety of deadly pathogens, including E Coli and tuberculosis. For most of history it was either consumed within moments of milking, or processed as cheese or yoghurt. Few drunk milk in its liquid form. “The Romans considered it a sign of barbarism,” said Mark Kurlansky, author of Milk! A 10,000-Year Food Fracas. “The only people who drank milk were people on farms, because they were the only ones who could get it fresh enough.” (Even then, cow’s milk was considered inferior to alternatives such as goat or donkey.) In the 19th century, “swill milk” – so called because cows were fed the filthy runoff from inner-city breweries, turning their milk blue – was linked with thousands of infant deaths. Only in the early 20th century, with the introduction of mandatory pasteurisation – in which milk is heated to kill off any bacteria before bottling – did milk become safe enough for most people to drink regularly. It was the first world war that ultimately aligned political forces behind the dairy business. In Britain, rationing meant food was limited, and child malnutrition was rife. The emerging field of nutritional science identified milk – with its high protein content and newly discovered “vital amines”, or vitamins – as a potential solution. Thanks to government price controls, milk was one thing not in short supply. Soon, “consumers everywhere witnessed a snowfall of propaganda documenting the miracles worked by milk”, writes Deborah Valenze in Milk: A Local and Global History. Milk became the original superfood: a boundless source of calcium, protein and vitamins. In 1946, Clement Attlee and Harry S Truman’s governments both passed measures to ensure milk was available free with school meals. Industry alliances like the UK’s Milk Marketing Board embarked on campaigns to enhance milk’s image. More recently, in the US, the Got Milk? campaign showed celebrities from Beyoncé to Kermit the Frog with milk moustaches. The message was clear: if you wanted your children to grow up big and strong, they needed to be drinking milk. Today, dairy is a vast and highly regulated behemoth, worth more than $400bn, produced by a global herd of more than 274 million cows. Politicians mess with milk at their peril (when Margaret Thatcher, as education secretary, in 1971 took the draconian step of cutting free school milk for the over-sevens, she was branded “milk snatcher”). And yet, for many consumers, the allure of milk is on the wane. In 1975, the average American consumed 247 pounds (around 130 litres) of milk per year; in 2017, it was just 149 pounds (66 litres). In the US, milk sales have fallen 15% since 2012. Milk’s “share of throat” – an industry term for the proportion of total liquid we consume in a day – has been eroded by a steady flow of soft drinks, juices and smoothies, even bottled water. But none of these presented an existential threat. Blanket marketing established the connection between milk and wholesomeness and good nutrition. Now new forms of persuasion, more targeted and pervasive, have stripped away that healthy sheen from dairy. The internet has given animal rights activists new reach. Search for “dairy” on YouTube and you will be assaulted by videos with titles like Dairy Is Scary (5m views), which depicts in graphic detail the suffering of dairy cows. Netflix, too, has provided previously untapped audiences for documentaries like Cowspiracy and What the Health. Besides the ill-treatment of animals, evidence has mounted that the dairy industry is catastrophic for the environment. Animal agriculture contributes more greenhouse gases than aviation, shipping and road vehicles combined. One recent study led by Oxford University claimed that observing a vegetarian or vegan diet is the single most effective way to reduce your own environmental footprint. Plant milks received a boost from their association with clean eating, a craze that has also had the effect of linking dairy with negative health issues. Clean eating, advocated by a fresh-skinned, glossy crop of wellness bloggers and Instagram celebrities, argued for the elimination of any foods deemed overly processed, allergenic, or otherwise “unnatural”: gluten, caffeine, meat and dairy. Its proponents blamed lactose intolerance as the cause of a range of ailments, including acne, eczema, lethargy, joint pain and a variety of digestive issues. And, as the clean eaters warned their readers off dairy, they sent them into the willing arms of plant milk startups. A steady supply of attractive millennial influencers filled their Instagram feeds with appetising shots of peanut-milk Thai curries and gluten-free beetroot bread. (According to industry analysts, one of the keys to the plant-based trend is that it looks appetising on Instagram.) The clean eaters did what years of vegan campaigning never could. Suddenly, giving up milk wasn’t just a health issue. It was part of living your best and most beautiful life. * * * The notion of milking plants is not new. In China, soya milk has been made since at least the 14th century, most commonly as a step in making tofu. The earliest written mention of almond milk appears in a Baghdadi cookbook from 1226, the Kitab al-Tabikh. “If you look at Medieval recipes, they will often give you a choice between milk or almond milk,” said Mark Kurlansky (whose best-seller Cod: A Biography, launched an entire genre of food microhistories). In the west, until recently, almond and soya milk remained relatively unknown, except by vegetarians and the odd eccentric (Henry Ford, of the car company, was an early soya evangelist). In 1956, the Plantmilk Society was established in London by Leslie Cross, then vice-president of the British Vegan Society, a nascent group of animal rights activists. Cross, who particularly objected to the cruelty of the dairy industry, set about trying to find a dairy replacement using crops that could be grown in Britain. “The big issue originally was: how do you get a protein in a liquid that can emulate dairy milk?” said Adrian Ling, whose father, Arthur, was chair of the new organisation. Photos from the time show the smiling pioneers in white lab coats examining many glasses of questionable opaque liquids. “They did a lot of work on cabbage,” Ling said. Eventually, they settled on the soya bean. “It was a very small market – a few hundred people,” said Ling. “They lost a lot of money.” In 1981, a young Belgian food tech named Philippe Vandemoortele decided to use a new packing technology, the sterile Tetra Brik, to sell soya milk. “I started in a garage with pots and pans, a grinder. I was young, and very naive,” Vandemoortele, now 73, told me. He called his soya milk Alpro. Reviews were mixed. The local supermarket refused to stock it. “The buyer tasted my product, and he said: ‘Whoa. It’s awful!’” But Vandemoortele persisted. Today Alpro is owned by Danone, and in 2017 had a turnover in excess of £183m. Soya’s real break came in the late 90s, when a Colorado soya company called WhiteWave made what seems like a confoundingly obvious discovery: if they moved the product to the refrigerated aisle alongside the dairy milk, more people bought it. WhiteWave’s new refrigerated soya drink, which it called Silk, was a sensation. At the same time, Silk, Alpro and others jumped on emerging evidence about the link between high cholesterol and heart disease to market themselves as a healthy alternative. All of a sudden, soya was for everyone. Soya’s rapid growth was short-lived, in large part due to the fact that it doesn’t taste very good. Even modern soya milks, which add sugar, thickeners and other additives to imitate dairy milk, have a beany taste and odour. In the early 2000s, soya had its own health scare. Soya contains phytoestrogens, oestrogen-like compounds that can mimic the hormone’s effects in humans, a discovery that led to fears about it disrupting hormones and “feminising” men. Clinical studies have consistently shown those fears are overstated. Even so, neo-Nazis continue to push the theory that soya milk is a liberal conspiracy to emasculate men, and drink cow’s milk at rallies to demonstrate “digestive superiority”. In 2008, the Blue Diamond Growers, a large cooperative of almond farmers in California, sensed an opportunity. Its milk, Almond Breeze, had long lagged behind Silk, by then America’s leading soya brand. “We knew if we were wanting to compete with them, we would need to be in the refrigerated case,” Al Greenlee, Blue Diamond’s director of marketing, told me. Supermarkets maintain a tight grip on shelf space, charging high fees to stock a new product. Lucrative, high-traffic displays like the refrigerated case are fiercely competitive. The owners of Silk at that time – the dairy giant Dean Foods – had leveraged its industry clout to get Silk positioned alongside milk. “So we followed a similar path, and established a partnership with the second largest dairy in the country”. Blue Diamond started in Florida, targeting neighbourhoods with large Hispanic populations, who have a higher genetic incidence of lactose intolerance. Meanwhile, the California almond industry embarked on a vast marketing spree, funding – and publicising – new research into the health benefits of almonds. The effect was immediate. Glossy magazines proclaimed almonds a “superfood”. Almond Breeze was so successful that within two years Silk launched its own almond milk to try and keep up. By 2013, almond had overtaken soya as the best-selling plant milk in the US. * * * In today’s crowded market, newcomers require something special to stand out. An Australian milk called Nutty Bruce boasts of “activated almonds”, which is a nod to the current craze for charcoal (superheated and then oxidised, “activated” charcoal is marketed as a detoxifier), but at closer inspection just means the almonds are soaked in water for slightly longer than usual. A San Francisco startup called Ripple claims to have developed a hi-tech process to isolate the protein in yellow peas without any of the associated flavours or colourings. Cheryl Mitchell, the chief scientist of the New York-based producer Elmhurst Milked, told me excitedly about her patented extraction process, which uses “high-pressure water and a sloughing action” to break down nuts and pulses while keeping the proteins intact. Mitchell comes from an esteemed line of food technologists: her father, Bill, invented Cool Whip imitation cream, the Pop Rocks popping candy and Tang fruit-flavoured drink. In the 1980s, she helped develop Rice Dream. Elmhurst was a dairy for 90 years; at its peak, it supplied public schools and Starbucks branches across Manhattan. But in 2016, its owners sold off the cattle and switched to plant milk. It now sells 11 varieties. “Wait till they see the corn milk,” she said. “It’s yellow, but it has more antioxidants than blueberries!” It seems every ingredient has its acolytes. “We are here to spread a philosophy about a way of being, one which is much more harmonious and symbiotic with nature,” Tamara Arbib, the founder of London-based coconut drinks company Rebel Kitchen, told me. Rebel Kitchen’s Mylk, launched in 2014, is a blend of coconut, rice and cashew. “I’m a massive fan of eating right for your blood type,” Arbib said. “A lot of blood types do better without dairy.” In July, I went to see one of the UK’s most prominent plant milk startups, Rude Health, in London. Launched by Camilla and Nick Barnard in 2005, Rude Health started out selling muesli, but quickly grew into a small health food empire. It was the tail end of a heatwave, at brunch time, and the Rude Health Cafe hummed with healthy looking professionals sipping cashew lattes. Nick, who has sharp features, grey hair, and wore an open-collared white shirt, ordered a kombucha. “I’m having dairy,” Camilla said, conspiratorially. Rude Health had attracted negative press in 2017, after some vegans became incensed at a company blogpost promoting sustainable dairy. “It hadn’t crossed our minds that to be for dairy free, we were expected to be against dairy,” Camilla said. “We were just chugging along, thinking we were for good quality.” The episode had made them reconsider their marketing strategy, to clarify that they’re not an exclusively vegan brand. “Why does everything have to be the magic pill, or the devil? Why do you have to be for or against?” Rude Health got into plant milks in 2013, selling three flavours: oat, brown rice and almond. Today, it sells 10, including Tiger Nut, Cashew and Hazelnut &amp; Cacao. We walked over to the company’s offices nearby for a tasting session. Rival products and plant-based cookbooks lined the shelves. Nick poured shots of various shades of beige into small glasses. Many plant milk brands add calcium carbonate – chalk – to make the liquid whiter and more opaque (the calcium content is a happy bonus) but the colouring in these plant milks, Camilla assured me, was natural. We tried a few. The coconut was sweet, like a Bounty dissolved in water. The hazelnut was pleasingly thick, if slightly overwhelming. “Tondo Gentile,” Nick said, approvingly. “A gourmet hazelnut.” The almond tasted thin by comparison. The brand’s regular Almond Drink contains brown rice, “cold-pressed” sunflower oil and sea salt, but Rude Health also offers Ultimate Almond – just nuts and water – intended for purists. “There is a hardcore market,” Camilla said. Today, almond makes up around two thirds of all plant milks sold, but it is suffering its own reputational crisis. One issue is environmental: it takes 4.5 litres of water to grow a single almond (technically not a nut, but a seed). In California, which grows eight in 10 of the world’s almond crop, almond growing consumes an estimated 10% of the entire water supply – a controversial issue in a state often afflicted by drought. Consumers have also caught on that the actual almond content of most almond milks is minuscule. Both Silk and Alpro contain just 2% almonds. “It’s actually a water-based emulsion that you’re adding oils, a lot of sugar and gums to, and then just adding a couple of nuts on top,” Elmhurst’s Cheryl Mitchell said. “As a business model, it’s great – any time you can sell water, right? That’s essentially what they’re doing.” The industry insiders I spoke to agreed that almond’s moment is over. Right now the real growth is in coconut, and in oat. In 2012, when Petersson took over as CEO of Oatly, almost nobody had heard of oat milk outside Sweden. The company was founded in 1994 by Rickard Öste, a researcher at the university of Lund. “It’s a really good crop. You can grow oats everywhere,” said Petersson. “It has carbs, it has fat, it has protein and it has fibre.” Compared to oat milk, he said, almond is just “flavoured plant juice”. Petersson, who is 50, with dark hair and slim features, set about reinventing oat milk’s image. He hired John Schoolcraft, a marketing and advertising executive who had been running his own company, to help him. The concept, Schoolcraft said, was simple: “If you’re not lactose intolerant, why would you notice our product?” The pair redesigned its packaging, ditching its previous generic, 1990s aesthetic for a brash, millennial-friendly redesign: Oatly was restyled as Oat-ly! and the side of each carton displayed one of more than 80 messages written by Oatly staff, which congratulated readers on being part of the “post-milk generation” and, only semi-ironically, joining “the cult”. Oatly’s real masterstroke was the creation of its Barista Edition. Most plant milks split in hot drinks – one reason that so many manufacturers use acidity regulators and other additives – and don’t foam like cow’s milk (the problem is the plant proteins). There, Oatly has an advantage: it foams, and the taste of oat is mostly masked by the coffee. Petersson and Schoolcraft ignored supermarkets and targeted coffee bars in the hip neighbourhoods of Brooklyn in New York and Shoreditch in London. “The volume comes from retail, but the demand is created in coffee shops,” Petersson explained. “That’s where you try our product and experience oat for the first time, in an environment that you like.” “It blew my hair back,” said Stuart Forsyth, a former barista and the co-founder of vegan coffee brand Minor Figures. “Oatly made oats sexy.” * * * Oatly’s growth hasn’t been without controversy. In 2015, the Swedish milk industry sued it, claiming its ad slogan “Like milk, but made for humans” unfairly denigrated cow’s milk. Oatly lost, but Petersson and Schoolcraft continue to use the slogan outside Sweden. “The line implies what everyone already knows. Milk is produced by cows for the benefit of baby cows,” said Schoolcraft. Whether or not plant milks really are a healthy substitute for cow’s milk is a matter of fierce debate, and not an inconsequential one. In June 2017, a Belgian couple were convicted of unintentionally causing the death of their seven-month-old baby, after feeding him oat and quinoa milks instead of infant formula. The parents, who ran a health-food shop, believed the child was lactose intolerant and sought the advice of homeopaths rather than seeking medical attention. Much of the debate revolves around whether or not plant milks should be fortified with additional vitamins to better imitate cow’s milk. Oatly fortifies its product according to WHO guidelines. Rude Health doesn’t. “The minute you start fortifying, you’re pretending it’s milk,” Camilla Barnard told me. “I don’t want to do that. It feels dishonest.” Because the Soil Association refuses organic certification to fortified products, many new plant milks choose the “purity” (and associated high price) of organic over the use of additional nutrients. Califia Farms’ unsweetened almond milk boasts “50% more calcium than milk” on its bottle – but it doesn’t contain Vitamin D, B12, Riboflavin or any of the other nutrients found in milk or other fortified plant milks. “A consumer has to read the label and understand the variation that exists in these milks, because they range tremendously,” said Dennis Savaiano, a professor of nutrition science at Purdue University who has studied milk for more than 30 years. What most plant milks are desperate to tell you is what they don’t have in them. Dairy-free; sugar-free; soya-free; gluten-free; GMO-free; bisphenol A-free – in some cases, the “free from” declarations are actually longer than the ingredients list. Califia Farms boasts its products are carrageenan-free, despite the widely used stabiliser being approved as safe by the European commission, the US Food and Drug Administration and the WHO. It’s the inevitable culmination of today’s anxious eating culture: we’ve gone from buying foods on the merits of their ingredients, to buying them on the basis of what’s left out. “If you look at our category, it’s a little bit messed up, you know?” Petersson conceded. “What’s the definition of an oat milk? Think of the comparison between oat milk and soya milk and almond or rice – are those all plant-based milks, or not? Nobody really knows.” To protect against such uncertainty – and protect the dairy industry from the upstarts – a US senator from Wisconsin sponsored a bill in 2017 called the Dairy Pride (Defending Against Imitations and Replacements of Yogurt, Milk and Cheese to Promote Regular Intake of Dairy Everyday) Act, which would ban plant drinks from impersonating dairy. “No one is necessarily drinking milk for the nutritional benefits of it,” said Tamara Arbib of Rebel Kitchen. “When you’re an adult, you’re having it because you want something creamy in your drinks.” It is true that our postwar worries about child malnutrition have been replaced with fears about childhood obesity. And the two-thirds of the world that can’t drink milk aren’t suffering from osteoporosis or rickets; in fact, China and Japan have lower rates of these conditions than Europe. “A lot of scientists think this thing about how children have to drink cow’s milk is bogus. This idea that it makes you big and strong is clearly bogus,” Mark Kurlansky, the food historian, told me. “On the other hand, this idea that ‘milk is bad for you so I’m going to have almond milk or soya milk or something’ – that’s bogus, too. Because it’s a totally different food.” * * * Every nutritionist I spoke to emphasised that milk is no less healthy than it’s ever been; in fact, it’s never been safer. “From a scientific perspective, the data that suggests milk is a bad food just doesn’t exist,” said Savaiano. “It has a lot of nutrients in it. It’s a great source of calcium, it’s a great source of protein, it’s a good source of riboflavin and potassium. So you can’t make the argument it’s not a nutritious food.” Nor could any health professional I spoke to point to any data showing a confirmed rise in diagnosed lactose intolerance, though most agreed that cases of self-diagnosis are rising. But the plant milk boom is not really about nutrition. Nor is it the first wave of a shift towards ethical, plant-based living – much as we need it. “Those other things might be on people’s lists, but they’re secondary selling characteristics,” explained Julian Mellentin, director of New Nutrition Business, a food industry analyst firm that has tracked plant milk’s rise. He pointed out that 90% of plant milk buyers still purchase other dairy products, like cheese and ice cream, both of which are still growing. The forces driving us towards plant milk are really something bigger: a manifestation of a collective anxiety that something is wrong with our bodies. That we aren’t as healthy and happy as we could be – or perhaps, should be – and something, or someone, must be to blame. “There’s a lot of people discovering dairy intolerances and gluten intolerances and that kind of stuff, but actually I think what you’re looking at is much more intolerance to the life we’ve been living,” said Arbib. Our growing suspicion of milk is perhaps a symptom of a lost faith: in Big Agriculture, in nutritional science. “People have learned that dietary advice changes,” Mellentin said. First saturated fat was killing us, now sugar is the number one enemy. Eggs and nuts were sources of bad cholesterol, now they’re superfoods. “So, understandably, people have become sceptical,” Mellentin went on. “Why listen to an expert when they change their mind all the time?” It doesn’t matter that that is how science works. Science changes, so who’s to say that your blood type doesn’t affect your dairy tolerance, or that carrageenan wasn’t the reason for some unspecified malaise? Just because our newfound lactose anxiety isn’t necessarily medically diagnosable, Mellentin said, that doesn’t mean it should be written off. “It’s not to do with allergies. It’s to do with how people feel, and making themselves feel better,” he said. How can you argue with that? Recently, Oatly has begun eyeing plant milk’s next target: China. It launched in the country in 2016, after receiving an undisclosed investment from a Chinese conglomerate. Sales have been promising. Demand for milk in China is growing, and Chinese businesses are investing heavily in plant milk and lactose-free alternatives. To Oatly, conquering China is more than business, it’s an ethical obligation. “The worst thing that could happen [environmentally] is if the Chinese people started to drink dairy milk, because there wouldn’t be enough cows in the world to support that,” said Toni Petersson, the CEO. The company’s latest challenge is competition: Quaker has announced plans for a line of oat drinks, and in January Silk launched its own oat brand, Oat Yeah. “We think oats can become its own category,” Petersson said. Other plant milk entrepreneurs were more cautious. Everyone knows how quickly health-food hype – juice cleanses, coconut oil – can die off. Meanwhile, kombucha is gaining ground as the gut-friendly food cure of the moment. Mellentin was blunt: “Peak plant milk is about three to five years away, at most.” • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here. • This article was amended on 29 January 2019.

The court, in a significant setback for the first minister, said that key parts of a continuity bill passed by Holyrood to repatriate EU powers in areas such as farming, fisheries and policing, breached UK law. Westminster, it ruled, had the ultimate say over EU legislation. Sturgeon now has only weeks to decide whether to amend the bill or scrap it entirely and reintroduce fresh draft legislation immediately after the Christmas and New Year holidays. Mike Russell, her constitutional affairs secretary, said he would start urgent talks with opposition parties next week. “Time is very short indeed, not just in respect of the bill but with Brexit more fundamentally,” Sturgeon’s spokesman said. “Time is tight.” The supreme court decision also means Scottish ministers could not embed the UN charter on fundamental rights into Scottish law, because that had been blocked by Theresa May’s Brexit legislation after Holyrood passed its emergency bill. Senior legal sources have said that the first minister could also ask the UK government to enact many of the legal changes needed to ensure Scottish law was updated and amended at Westminster, rather than by Holyrood. The Scottish government has already done so with nearly 50 pieces of EU law, including on GMO regulations, chemicals safety, common fisheries policy, the trade in endangered species, radioactive contamination of food, animal exports, organ transplants and the EU’s greenhouse gases trading scheme. Leaving all the remaining powers to Westminster would involve a significant climbdown: Sturgeon insisted on introducing the legislation in February in an emergency session of the Scottish parliament after she and the then Welsh first minister, Carwyn Jones, accused May’s government of a power grab. May insisted the UK government had the first say over how 153 EU laws and regulations would be divided up between Westminster and the devolved governments, even though many of the regulations covered powers overseen by the Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish legislatures. The court sparked a row between the UK and Scottish governments by confirming that much of the bill was lawful when it was introduced in March, but had since been made unlawful when the UK government changed the EU Withdrawal Act in the Lords, to further limit Holyrood’s powers. The lord advocate, James Wolffe, told the Scottish parliament that it had affected significant swathes of the bill. Even though the Scottish Brexit bill was passed before the EU Withdrawal Act, it could not get royal assent until after the supreme court issued its ruling. The UK government said on Thursday it had made clear what it would be doing last year, so its changes to the act were not a surprise. Russell rejected that, accusing UK ministers of “constitutional vandalism”. However, the supreme court stated that one key part of the Scottish bill, section 17, had always been unconstitutional since it tried to override the Scotland Act which set up the Scottish parliament. That gave Westminster ultimate authority over Holyrood in some key areas. Adam Tomkins, the Scottish Conservatives’ constitution spokesman, said the supreme court’s ruling meant the continuity bill was dead and should be withdrawn. “It eviscerates the bill, leaving it in tatters,” he told MSPs after Wolffe’s statement.",https://media.guim.co.uk/6515d75e3353e0465248b8034f76bed66ca6e062/0_50_3500_2100/500.jpg,0.1230233002291826

By Bernhard Warner</p>,4734,"The spring of 2008 was brutal for Europe’s honeybees. In late April and early May, during the corn-planting season, dismayed beekeepers in Germany’s upper Rhine valley looked on as whole colonies perished. Millions of bees died. France, the Netherlands and Italy reported big losses, but in Germany the incident took on the urgency of a national crisis. “It was a disaster,” recalled Walter Haefeker, German president of the European Professional Beekeepers Association. “The government had to set up containers along the autobahn where beekeepers could dump their hives.” An investigation in July of that year concluded that the bees in Germany died of mass poisoning by the pesticide clothianidin, which can be 10,000 times more potent than DDT. In the months leading up to the bee crisis, clothianidin, developed by Bayer Crop Science from a class of insecticides called neonicotinoids, had been used up and down the Rhine following an outbreak of corn rootworm. The pesticide is designed to attack the nervous system of crop-munching pests, but studies have shown it can be harmful to insects such as the European honeybee. It muddles the bees’ super-acute sense of direction and upsets their feeding habits, while it can also alter the queen’s reproductive anatomy and sterilise males. As contaminated beehives piled up, Bayer paid €2m (£1.76m) into a compensation fund for beekeepers in the affected area, but offered no admission of guilt. The die-off forced a reckoning among European farmers. Hundreds of studies examined the safety of neonicotinoids, known as neonics, and their links to colony collapse disorder (CCD), in which worker bees abandon the hive, leaving the queen and her recent offspring unprotected, to starve. In 2013, the evidence led to a landmark European commission ruling, imposing a moratorium on clothianidin and two other major neonics – the world’s most popular pesticides. This April, Europe went a step further. The commission extended the ban on the trio of neonics to virtually everywhere outside greenhouses, citing evidence that by harming pollinating insects, neonics interfere with the pollination of crops to the value of €15bn a year. Environmentalists cheered the victory. Regulators beyond Europe plan to follow. For Haefeker at the beekeepers association, who had spent years campaigning against the use of neonics, victory was sweet, but short-lived: faced with multiple threats from modern farming methods, beekeepers know the insecticide ban alone is not enough to save the honeybee. Honeybees originated in Eurasia roughly 35m years ago, and as long as they have had steady access to flowering plants, they have thrived. But in the modern world, bees face all kinds of dangers. Colony collapse is not a single malady, but rather an amalgamation of different challenges. Alongside the dangers of pesticides, diseases such as Israeli acute paralysis virus, gut parasites and invasive parasites such as the varroa mite can overwhelm the bees’ immune systems. Industrial agriculture imposes its own threats: a mania for monocultures has led to shrinking foraging habitats, while, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency, bees employed in commercial pollination, in which hives are stacked high on trucks and driven around the country to pollinate almond trees and other crops, get highly stressed, which damages their resilience and eating habits. Since the EU began phasing out neonics, in 2014, the honeybees’ recovery has not been as dramatic as hoped. Neonics are probably not the biggest factor in the demise of bees, but they are the easiest to outlaw. To farmers, this seems outrageously unfair. Citing an industry-funded study, they say the ban will cost the EU agriculture sector €880bn annually in diminished crop yields. Another, more controversial, response to the slump in bee populations is in the works. This is the plan to create a more resilient strain of honeybee – a genetically modified superbee. The technology for creating GM honeybees is in its infancy, and still confined to the laboratory. But, if successful, it could lead to a hardier species, one that is resistant to natural and manmade hazards: viruses, varroa mites, pesticides and so on. If we can’t change modern farming practices, the thinking goes, maybe we should change the bees. The prospect horrifies many bee people – from commercial beekeepers such as Haefeker to passionate amateurs – who see a lab-made superbee as a direct threat to the smaller, struggling bee species. Traditional beekeepers have a name for them that expresses their fear and suspicion: Frankenbees. Like many beekeepers, Haefeker is an activist and conservationist. A kind of bearded Lorax, Dr Seuss’s valiant spokesman for threatened trees, Haefeker speaks for the bees. For much of the past two decades, he has sounded the alarm on declining bee health, bringing his message to lawmakers in Brussels, Berlin and Munich, before judges at the European court of justice in Luxembourg, to investor roundtables in London, to beekeeper conferences in Istanbul, Austria and Rome, and to corporate gatherings of the agrichemical industry around Europe. When we met in Bavaria a week after the EU extended its neonics ban, I expected Haefeker to be in celebratory mood. But over lunch at a favourite roadway tavern an hour outside Munich, he explained that he considers the development of GM bees – however long it takes to get them in production – an even greater threat to the humble honeybee. “I don’t expect it to be commercialised next week, but then I don’t want to leave anything up to chance,” Haefeker said. “The public has been pretty late on a whole bunch of bad ideas. We don’t want to be late on this one.” Some beekeepers worry that, if the agriculture industry succeeds in building and patenting a blockbuster, mite-free, pesticide-proof superbee, it would dominate and destroy the vibrant local market in conventional bee strains. There are health fears, too: the sting of GM bees may introduce new allergy risks. And beekeepers are afraid they would not be able to protect the gene pool of traditional strains such as the beloved Apis mellifera, the scientific name for the European honeybee, against a dominant, pesticide resistant, lab-designed version. Jay Evans heads the bee research lab at the US Department of Agriculture, where they are looking at various threats to bee health. Designing a truly pesticide-resistant honeybee, a “bulletproof bee”, as Evans calls them, would “throw a lot of nature under the bus”. * * * It is always hive-like – 30C and humid – in the narrow, windowless laboratory where genetically engineered honeybees are created on the campus of Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf, Germany. One June day, three students in T-shirts were on the morning shift. Two of them silently inspected plastic honeycomb discs. Each disc contained 140 tiny plug holes, in each of which a single honeybee embryo was growing. These discs were then passed to a third student at a separate workstation, where, with remarkable dexterity, she injected each egg with an sgRNA gene-manipulation solution, a main ingredient in a revolutionary new gene-editing technique called Crispr-Cas9. Crispr technology has transformed microbiology in recent years by allowing scientists to copy a desirable part of the DNA strand and insert it directly into the chromosome of the target specimen. Now, with great precision, scientists can remove harmful mutations or unwanted traits, or insert a desired trait. In the US, you can buy a Crispr apple that doesn’t brown. Medical researchers, meanwhile, see Crispr as a promising route to making mosquitos resistant to the malaria parasite. The director of the Düsseldorf lab is Martin Beye, a giant in the field of evolutionary genetics. In 2003, Beye and his colleagues were the first to pinpoint the gene variants, or alleles, that determine the sex of honeybees. Three years later (coincidentally, just as scientists determined the likely causes of colony collapse disorder), Beye and an international team of biologists decoded the Apis mellifera honeybee genome, a breakthrough that transformed the field of bee biology. Scientists now have an understanding of bee health down to the chromosomal level, enabling them, for example, to analyse precisely how pathogens and parasites affect their bee hosts. Genomics can take much of the guesswork out of breeding, too, revealing the precise gene markers that make stocks more resilient to stressors and disease. Once the genome was cracked, it was only a matter of time before the scientific community would build a designer bee. In 2014, Beye’s lab claimed that crown. The gene-injection method Beye’s team pioneered, and laid out in their 2014 research paper, is painstaking and fraught with risk. To demonstrate, a student motioned for me to peer into her microscope. The faint outline of a tiny needle and its intended target, the egg, came into focus. Magnified, the egg looked like a smooth grey balloon, the kind performers at children’s parties tie into poodles and giraffes. Poke the egg at the wrong angle, or with too much pressure, or with an imprecise dosage, and it will pop. And the injection has to be stealthy enough to leave no marks. If the worker bees, the hive’s fastidious caretakers, sense in any way the pupae are not perfect, they cast them from the nest, leaving them for dead. Only the pristine survive. To increase the odds of success, Beye’s team keep their injected embryos away from the workers at first, incubating in an artificial hive. Only after 72 hours do they slip the fittest of their modified larvae specimens into a queen-rearing colony. What happens next is similar to the conventional queen-breeding method. The researchers graft the larvae into cell cups lined with royal jelly, the nutrient rich compound that young larvae gorge on to become queens. Even so, the workers, on average, rejected three out of four mutant larvae. But the survival rate was enough to guarantee the birth, in 2014, of the world’s first genetically modified honeybee queens. I was also shown the transgenic queens. Up close, they looked vigorous, but unremarkable. The researchers affixed a magenta-coloured ID tag to the queen’s back, between the base of her wings. She mingled with ordinary worker bees in a small wooden nucleus hive. The sides were made of a hard plastic for viewing. Beye’s research team told me their transgenic bees behave no differently than any other Apis mellifera honeybees. The queen and the workers covered every inch of their cramped confines, popping in and out of a small well containing water. After a week or so, the queen would be moved outside to a flight cage. Beye’s researchers believe manipulating the genome of the European honeybee will lead to new insights into what makes this species unique – which genes make them such meticulous groomers, or which genes programme the worker bees’ super-assiduous attention to looking after their young. They want to know why bees are so good to each other. Is this instinct to work tirelessly for the good of the hive something learned, or genetic? Beekeepers, dismayed at the prospect of GM bees becoming a reality, made a huge fuss about Beye’s work. Many suspected his lab was bankrolled by the agriculture industry, or “Big Ag”. “The beekeeper associations … ” Beye said, shaking his head in lingering disbelief. In person, he is affable and professorial. “They thought we were working with Bayer. I mean, they’re very close by: Bayer’s headquarters is maybe 20km from here.” He insisted inferences of a Bayer connection were totally false. Beye and Marianne Otte, his research partner, explained that the purpose of their work was to understand the genetic basis for bee behaviour and health. It was never to build a pesticide-resistant bee. Building a GM bee, Beye said, is “a stupid idea”. The world doesn’t need chemical-resistant bees, he says. It needs farming practices that don’t harm bees. “They should be working on that. Not on manipulating the bee.” But the truth is that Beye’s highly detailed paper serves as a kind of blueprint for how to build a bee. Thanks to research like his, and the emergence of tools such as Crispr, it has never been cheaper or so straightforward for a chemical company to pursue a superbee resistant to, say, the chemicals it makes. Takeo Kubo, a professor of molecular biology at the University of Tokyo, was the second scientist in the world to make a genetically modified bee in his lab. He told me that he, too, is focused on basic research, and has no ties to the agriculture industry. But, unlike Beye, he welcomes the prospect of GM bee swarms buzzing around the countryside. Lab-made, pesticide-resistant bees could be a real saviour for beekeepers and farmers, he says. And, he adds, the science is no more than three years away. “I’m now 57 years old,” he told me via email, “and completely optimistic to see such transgenic bees in the marketplace in my lifetime!” It is not yet legal to release genetically engineered bees into the wild, but the private sector is already watching closely. One US startup contacted Beye’s lab offering to help commercialise their breakthrough research. Beye said no. Beekeepers tend to see the world through the eyes of their bees. After a few hours in their presence, you too begin to re-evaluate your surroundings. The monochrome sameness of our farmlands – that vast, neat checkerboard of green and brown that feeds us mammals so well – can be a desert for foraging pollinators. The shocking yellow brilliance of rapeseed in blossom each spring can be a reservoir of pesticides. Beekeepers have learned to mitigate the risks and adapt, mainly by moving their hives around an ever-dwindling patch of safe zones. But the genetically modified bee, which can breed with other species and looks just like bees hand-raised from carefully chosen strains, is an altogether more dangerous challenge. Jay Evans at the US agriculture department, an entomologist and beekeeper, admires Beye’s work, but thinks his breakthrough GM bee should remain confined to the lab. “The road to making a superbee looks really long to me, and probably not necessary,” he said. “I don’t see the justification.” * * * Haefeker, a former tech entrepreneur, came to beekeeping late in life, around his 40th birthday. After spending two decades in Silicon Valley, he, his wife and two sons returned home to Germany in 2001, settling in a picturesque village on Lake Starnberg, halfway between Munich and the Bavarian Alps. What started as a backyard hobby quickly became an obsession, then a growing business. Haefeker studied everything about beekeeping, from hive maintenance to nutrition. Later, he developed an iPhone app for breeders called iQueen and started a podcast called Bienenpolitik, or Beekeeping and Politics. One of the few tech-savvy beekeepers in bucolic Upper Bavaria, in 2003 Haefeker was recruited to join the local professional beekeepers association where second- and third-generation beekeepers routinely grumbled about modern farming practices gobbling up open space. His first assignment was to investigate an issue that nobody at the organisation knew much about: GM crops. “I had no opinion of GMOs (genetically modified organisms),” he recalls. “But as the new kid on the block it was my job to figure out: is this going to have an impact on us?” Haefeker’s investigations into GMOs turned into a decade-long crusade. What began as a local case involving a Bavarian beekeeper with GMO-contaminated honey grew into an epic battle, pitting Europe’s beekeepers against two giants: Monsanto, the biotech giant that markets MON810, the pest-resistant genetically modified maize, and the World Trade Organization, which, at the time, was pressuring the EU to give GM crops a chance. The beekeepers eventually won a huge victory in 2011 in the European court of justice, keeping European honey, for now, virtually GMO-free. The fight continues, but the beekeepers’ message was clear: don’t underestimate us. The agrichemical companies’ business model is to dominate both ends of the market. They sell the farmer the chemical that kills the pests, and then they sell them their patented seeds, genetically engineered to withstand those very chemicals. (Monsanto’s top-selling line of Roundup Ready herbicide-resistant seeds are marketed as the best defence against Roundup, Monsanto’s top-selling herbicide.) The multinationals have locked farmers into contracts that prevent them from manipulating the seeds to develop their own cross-breed. Beekeepers fear genetic engineering of honeybees will introduce patents and privatisation to one of the last bastions of agriculture that is collectively managed and owned by no one. “Think about it,” Haefeker told me, “the one area Big Ag doesn’t yet control is pollination.” And pollination is huge. The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that pollinators help farmers grow crops worth up to $577bn (£437bn) annually. Damage to the bee population, by harming a vital pollinator, is already threatening crops worldwide. Outside FAO’s headquarters in Rome, a neon billboard flashes in English, Italian and Arabic a series of urgent save-the-planet messages. Save the bees tops the list. If bees disappear, food crops and animal feeds, not to mention the raw materials for biofuels (from canola and palm oil), textiles (cotton) and medicines, will simply vanish from much of the planet. It has got so bad in some parts of China that humans already pollinate some crops by hand. In what feels like a riff on a Black Mirror episode, Harvard researchers are working on the RoboBee, a flying robotic pollinator that is half the size of a paperclip and weighs less than one-tenth of a gram. In March, Walmart filed a series of patents for its own tiny robotic pollinators. Beekeepers and conservationists believe bees should be left to evolve on their own, helped only by protection of open spaces and best-practice natural breeding methods. Conventional bee breeding has embraced technology in recent years via the introduction of apps, tracking software and temperature-controlled “finishing” incubators. But the method is otherwise little changed from ancient times. During the year, beekeepers will perform what they call “splitting the hive”, or separating a portion of the colony, frame by frame, and putting the frames in new hives with new inhabitants. This can invigorate the gene pool by introducing hardy newcomers. “Before the introduction of neonicotinoids,” Haefeker said, “about 15 years ago, you’d open up the hive and it was bursting with healthy bees. That level of reproductive energy is really crucial.” During 2008, Germany’s infamous season of heavy colony losses, the dead piled up on the ground under Haefeker’s hives and along the hive’s inner floor. “It’s got better in recent years, since the bans went into place. But we’re not yet back to where we were in the days before neonics,” he said. “That will take years.” He tests the spring pollen for traces of neonics and other chemicals. The level of contamination is much improved, he says. On his property in Bavaria, he offered me a pinch of raw pollen. The sharp, sweet taste lingered on my tongue. I peered down to get a good look at the workers entering one of the hives. They streamed in one by one, their thighs weighed down with yellow balls of dandelion pollen. “It’s good, isn’t it?” Haefeker chuckled proudly. By late July, cracks had appeared in the new neonics law. More than a dozen EU member states sought loopholes to stay the ban, and Bayer pledged to appeal against its legal basis, warning that the ban would limit our ability to grow the quantities of “safe, affordable” food we need. Despite the setback, Haefeker remains defiant. “Their business model is obsolete,” he told me on the phone in July. The “big six” companies of Big Ag are in the process of merging into three, forming Bayer-Monsanto, Dow-DuPont and Syngenta-ChemChina. This historic, quarter-of-a-trillion-dollar spending spree is a sign of market uncertainty, Haefeker asserts, not strength. The future, he says, is big data. Sensor- and computer-assisted crop care – digital crop protection, as it is known, in which tiny robots and drones will tend to rows and rows of crops round the clock, picking off pests and releasing super-precise flows of irrigation – will feed the planet’s billions, not chemicals. “I’ve been telling them this for years.” However ground down by Haefeker’s tireless advocacy for bees they may be, Bayer officials told me they largely concur with his view that the industry is beginning to grow less reliant on chemicals, and investing more in big data and tiny robots. They even let Haefeker in the building from time to time to discuss that digital future. * * * Humans have been consuming honey since our hunter-gatherer days. Not long after we began farming, we started keeping bees (sugar came several millennia later). About 10,000 years ago artists depicted apiculture on the walls of Spanish caves, and, centuries after that, demand for bees wax and honey drove commerce across the empires of ancient Greece and Rome. In the 20th century, apiology, the study of bees, took off. In the 1920s, Austrian zoologist Karl von Frisch was the first to explain the meaning of the honeybees’ waggle dance, which communicates to other bees the direction and distance of a food source; a half-century later he won the Nobel Prize. Honeybees are eusocial creatures, making them one of the most studied insects on the planet. Researchers study the species to understand how the human brain works and to improve the design of supercomputers. Bees, it turns out, can even do abstract maths.There are 22 million beekeepers across 146 countries, estimates Apimondia, a 123-year-old organisation that protects and promotes the livelihood of beekeepers, and lately they have been seeing a dramatic rise in membership. “During a downturn in the economy of a country, the number of new members increases,” Philip McCabe, an Irish beekeeper and president of Apimondia, told me. The media attention around colony collapse and bee health continues to bring in new members as well. In October, 2017, Haefeker delivered a presentation at Apimondia’s International Apicultural Congress in Istanbul, unveiling Apimondia’s answer to Frankenbees. Like Haefeker himself, the fix he proposes is geeky and left-leaning: an open-source license for honeybees. A software engineer, he takes inspiration from the free software movement of the 1980s and 90s, which gave birth to the “open source” concept. Now, he sees such a licence promoting open collaboration as the perfect model to protect the beekeepers from a nightmare scenario – powerful corporations building a genetically engineered bee that they then commercialise and lock down with patents and trademarks. In his opening remarks, Haefeker launched into what he called “the big question”. “Did anybody ask our permission before they took our bees, the bees we have been working on, selecting and breeding within Apimondia, before the scientists decided to take these bees and modify them?” The answer was, of course, no. Until that moment, nobody, not even beekeepers, claimed an ownership stake on the bees’ genetic code. Anyone can start a hive, which might explain why you can find beekeepers tending to hives in Yemeni war zones, on the roof of Paris’ Bastille opera house and in Tanzanian refugee camps. The free exchange of breeding materials – from the queens and her eggs to the drones’ sperm – has long been encouraged to keep colonies genetically diverse. Through this free exchange, we preserve a common resource, benefitting everyone and everything. The beekeepers get healthier colonies out of the arrangement. We get flowers, food and honey. To get around any attempt by the agriculture industry to distribute and license superbees, Apimondia is seeking to enshrine this freedom as a right in the form of an open-source contract, establishing bee breeding as a public good that nobody can own outright. “This is the most efficient way to legally protect our bees from patenting and privatisation by commercial interests,” Haefeker insists. Later, he told me, “we don’t want to get screwed, the way farmers did by corporations and their GM patented seeds.” Apimondia has minuscule lobbying resources, but it has lined up powerful allies, including the FAO, environmental NGOs and scientific advisers. Together, they press for international treaties to protect vital pollinators. Now Apimondia, too, is sounding the alarm on GM honeybees. Radical bee-breeding experiments don’t always end well, McCabe reminded me. Beekeepers won’t soon forget the story of the Africanised bee, a cross-breed between the African bee and European strains introduced in South America in the 1950s. It escaped quarantine, mated with indigenous species and then multiplied and multiplied, venturing thousands of miles north into the US, breeding with local species and quickly coming to dominate their gene pool. It landed the unfortunate, even nativist, nickname “African killer bee” for the aggressive manner in which it defends its nest. “That’s what we’re concerned with,” McCabe says, “any inter-breeding that messes with the genetics of indigenous bee populations.” Jay Evans keeps bees on the grounds of his job at the USDA, at the government research facility in Maryland, 30 minutes north of Washington DC. I contacted him by phone and asked how things were going. “Terribly,” he said with a wry laugh. “The losses have doubled in the last 10 years.” He blames a host of factors, with disease and parasites such as the varroa mite chief among them. Beekeepers, he added, are closely watching what happens next in Europe. “I go to beekeepers’ meetings all the time. They’re suffering. They’re trying to keep their operations afloat. They’re desperate for a new solution, or technology, or regulation. Anything,” he says. But there’s consensus on what they don’t want. “When I talk to a group, I talk a lot about genetics. And occasionally they’ll say: ‘Are you making a transgenic bee, one of those Frankenbees?’” * * * Haefeker and his business partner, Arno Bruder, run their beekeeping enterprise on a field bordering two organic farms in Upper Bavaria. Their colonies have recovered somewhat since the neonics ban went into effect, he said, but they take steps to protect their hives. A lot of beekeepers pack their hives on to trailers and position them near nature reserves or in fields like the one in which we stood. “Over time you learn where you have the worst exposure to whatever it is that harms the bees,” Haefeker said. He pulled out a frame to reveal a queen. Like an awkward commuter on the tube, she brushed up against every inhabitant near her as she made her way from one end of the frame to the other. The jostling has a purpose; it reassures the cavorting masses. “It’s the queen’s pheromones,” he explained. It makes them relaxed and productive. “The pheromones affect us beekeepers, too.” He says he plans to harness this anti-stress essence and build a kind of a bee-powered wellness centre on the two-hectare property. I pictured Munich’s pampered classes soaking up queen-bee pheromones in a lodge in the hills around Lake Starnberg. A moment later, Haefeker put the frame back, closed the lid, and surveyed his hives with satisfaction. He and Bruder then discussed what’s next. Keeping bees safe from pesticides is labour-intensive and requires specialist local knowledge. Bruder agreed to wake before dawn the following morning and pack up some of the hives, load them on to a trailer and drive the bees to higher ground. They had decided on a region in the foothills of the Alps, about an hour away, near the Wieskirche, an 18th-century church on the Unesco world heritage list. There would be fresh dandelion flowers up there. The bees would be further away from intensive agriculture, said Haefeker. “We’ve scouted out the locations.” Meanwhile, it is possible that humankind has even more extreme designs on bees. Earlier this month, Haefeker sent me a message pointing to something called Insect Allies, a $45m research project sponsored by Darpa, the US Department of Defense’s military research department. It proposes using insects to carry immune-boosting mutations designed to protect crops from drought, flooding, pathogens and bioweapons. In essence, the visiting insects would modify the plant’s genetic makeup. A group of academics from universities in Germany and France declared the programme’s existence alarming, saying it turns the insects themselves into bioweapons. Darpa does not say what kind of insects it plans to use, but Haefeker did not like the sound of it. “We need to keep an eye on this craziness,” his text read, “in case they want to use bees to transport their genetically modified viruses into crops.” • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here. • This main image in this article was changed on 16 October 2018 to replace a photograph of a hoverfly.",https://media.guim.co.uk/993c955fdc373fa494da02a7befe3893fda6f321/57_0_5290_3175/500.jpg,0.06229753044096206

The “false and misleading” practice suits come after it emerged that a teenager who was severely allergic to sesame died at London’s Heathrow airport in 2016, after eating an unlabelled Pret sandwich that contained the ingredient. In the US case, lab tests allegedly found traces of glyphosate – a biocide in Monsanto’s widely used Roundup weedkiller – in Harvest oatmeal raisin cookies, egg salad and arugula sandwiches, and other products made with the chain’s nine-grain granary bread. A court in San Francisco last month ordered Monsanto to pay a non-Hodgkins lymphoma sufferer $289m (£220m) in damages after a jury ruled that his cancer had been caused by exposure to Roundup. The Organic Consumers Association (OCA), a plaintiff in the latest case, cited surveys showing that consumers expected the word “natural” to mean pesticide-free products. “Companies like Pret a Manger know this,” the OCA’s international director, Ronnie Cummins, told the Guardian. “By describing their products or brands as ‘natural’, they are knowingly deceiving consumers in order to sell more product, and charge higher prices. We believe consumers should know the truth about this advertising tactic, and about what is actually in the food they are buying.” Pret a Manger declined to comment on the case. The court action follows a legal victory by the OCA and others in August, which forced Nature Valley granola bars to remove a “100% natural” label after glyphosate residues were found in the product. Suing a restaurant chain marks a tactical escalation in the battle against glyphosate, albeit one that has previously sparked U-turns by companies such as Ben &amp; Jerry’s. The Guardian understands that similar litigation is being prepared against other US restaurant chains. Given that enough of the weedkiller has now been sprayed to cover almost every cultivable acre of the planet in half a pound of the substance, it also opens up a question of which products could legitimately claim to be free of residue traces. Kim Richman, a partner in the Richman law firm prosecuting the suits, told the Guardian: “Our clients believe that companies will need to start using the phrase ‘natural’ more responsibly in the future, taking legitimate precautions to avoid contamination by glyphosate or other synthetic biocides. “While glyphosate is indeed ubiquitous, it doesn’t need to be – and the campaign to put food producers and restaurants on notice about the issue is an important step in getting them to take glyphosate reduction seriously.” The latest actions were filed by Richman’s law firm on behalf of the OCA and GMO-Free USA, in the District of Columbia, and on behalf of Samara Daly and Linda Virtue, in the eastern district of New York. While this second action aims to “recover monetary damages”, it is not a personal injury suit. Last year, Pret was censured by the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority for claiming that its products did not contain the sort of “obscure chemicals, additives and preservatives” used by its competitors. The ASA ruled this misleading because the chain’s sandwich bread in fact contained three E numbers widely used in the food retail sector: E472e , E471 and E300.",https://media.guim.co.uk/046a7e2e458df31b8ab13af236285e5c1d64b61d/0_86_4000_2401/500.jpg,0.034099927849927845
22,article,environment/2018/sep/10/fossil-fuel-divestment-funds-rise-to-6tn,Environment,2018-09-10,Fossil fuel divestment funds rise to $6tn,https://gu.com/p/9btd8,News,Fossil fuel divestment funds rise to $6tn,"<p>Insurance companies lead the sell-off of coal, oil and gas stocks over climate change and financial fears – oil majors now cite divestment as a risk to them</p>",785,"The funds committed to fossil fuel divestment now total more than $6tn (£4.6tn), with almost 1,000 institutional investors having made the pledge, according to a new report. The sell-off of coal, oil and gas investments is led by the insurance industry, with $3tn of funds. But it also now includes the first nation to divest, Ireland, major cities including New York and key medical organisations. Major oil companies such as Shell have this year cited divestment as a material risk to its business. Fossil fuel divestment began on US university campuses in 2011 but now spans 37 nations around the world. Supporters of divestment say existing fossil fuel resources are already far greater than can be burned without causing catastrophic climate change and that exploring for and producing more fossil fuels is therefore morally wrong. They also say fossil fuel companies are risky investments as global action on emissions gets tougher. Some investors argue that remaining as shareholders and persuading fossil fuel companies to change can be more effective. However, another new report finds this approach has not delivered any significant change to date. The new divestment report, by Arabella Advisors, calculates that investors with $6.2tn in assets under management have committed to divest from fossil fuels, up from $5.2tn in the previous report in 2016. “I commend the divestment movement for its incredible progress,” said Mary Robinson, former UN high commissioner on human rights and former president of Ireland. Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York City, and Sadiq Khan, mayor of London, which is in the process of divesting, said in a joint article for the Guardian: “We must use our economic might to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Taking this kind of action now could help us make a crucial difference to the people we represent and the future of our planet. Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of GMO, one of the world’s most influential asset management companies, said the financial case for divestment was compelling. “Investors with long-term horizons should avoid oil stocks on investment grounds. They face a sustained headwind. Ethical arguments for divestments are simply not necessary. They are a pure bonus,” he said. Another new report, from Genus Capital Management in Canada, said its fossil free fund had outperformed a benchmark of standard stock market indices by almost 2% per year over the last five years. The company’s Fossil Free CanGlobe Equity Fund is a mix of Canadian and global stocks. “At the five-year mark, we can conclusively say: divesting from fossil fuels pays,” said CEO Wayne Wachell. The Arabella Advisors report noted that the American Medical Association (AMA) and the UK’s Royal College of General Practitioners had both divested. “It is unwise to own fossil fuels companies long-term and the products of these companies are harmful to human health by producing dangerous air pollution and contributing to global climate change,” said Dr Todd Sack at the AMA. Divestment appears to be concerning oil and gas majors. In Shell’s last annual report it states: “It could have a material adverse effect on the price of our securities and our ability to access equity capital markets.” Furthermore, the World Bank Group has committed to stopping funding oil and gas development and major insurers including Swiss Re have decided to stop underwriting coal projects. The report on investor engagement on with fossil fuel companies, from shareholder advocacy group As You Sow, found that 160 climate change shareholder resolutions were filed at 24 US oil and gas companies between 2012 and 2018. However, none of the companies have adopted plans or targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels and most are investing to maintain or expand production. “The oil and gas sector has not stepped up to address the growing risks to their companies, the broader economy, and our planet,” said Andrew Behar, As You Sow CEO. The call for ethical investment was backed by Pope Francis in June 2018, when he addressed the heads of oil companies. He said “disturbing and a cause for real concern” that carbon emissions were still rising and added: “Even more worrying is the continued search for new fossil fuel reserves, whereas the Paris agreement clearly urged keeping most fossil fuels underground.” Ellen Dorsey, at the philanthropic Wallace Global Fund, said the pressure to divest would continue. “Today, our movement pledges to increase divested global assets to $10tn by 2020.” She said investing in clean energy was as important as pulling funds from polluting firms: “Investors should also commit at least 5% of their portfolio to climate solutions to help rapidly scale to 100% renewable energy and universal energy access.” Robinson backed the clean investment call: “This is what climate justice requires.”",https://media.guim.co.uk/718df224c8c66f5f588612ba18907e1282228a85/0_195_3644_2186/500.jpg,0.14866663529707008

The landmark decision ends 10 years of debate in Europe about what is – and is not – a GM food, with a victory for environmentalists, and a bitter blow to Europe’s biotech industry. It also marks a setback for UK scientists who took advantage of a legal grey area to begin field trials of gene edited camelina crops, augmented with Omega-3 fish oils. Greenpeace said that the ruling meant the British government – along with Belgium, Sweden and Finland – was now obliged to “revoke” the green light for the trials until appropriate precautions had been taken. In their ruling, the EU judges said: “Organisms obtained by mutagenesis are GMOs [genetically modified organisms] … It follows that those organisms come, in principle, within the scope of the GMO directive and are subject to the obligations laid down [therein].” The court sided with the French agricultural trades union, Confédération Paysanne, which brought the case, arguing that new and unconventional in vitro mutagenesis techniques were likely to be used to produce herbicide-resistant plants, with potential health risks. A study published in the journal Nature last week found that the gene-editing technology Crispr-Cas9 can cause significantly greater genetic distortions than expected, with potential “pathogenic consequences”. Gene editing alters the genomes of a living species by slicing genome strands in a bid to remove undesirable traits, without inserting foreign DNA. The US biotech firm Cibus has already tried to bypass the EU’s decision-making process to bring its herbicide-resistant ODM oilseed rape to market, according to documents released under freedom of information laws. But Prof Johnathan Napier, who leads the UK’s field trials of Crispr-edited plants at Rothamsted Research, denounced the court ruling as “a backward step, not progress.” He said: “This is a very disappointing outcome, and one that will hinder European innovation, impact and scientific advance. The classification of genome-edited organisms as falling under the GMO directive could slam the door shut on this revolutionary technology.” When the organism’s cells repair, their DNA is rearranged in a way that the biotech industry believes will safely allow crops to develop, for instance, drought-resistant characteristics, so boosting innovation, jobs and trade. Beat Späth, the green director of EuropaBio, which represents companies such as Dow, Dupont and Monsanto, said: “Billions of euros have been spent on research and development into genome editing, by taxpayers and industry alike. The big risk is that all this money will now not be translated into products for Europe’s farmers.” A spokesman for Rothamsted Research said that it was “impossible to say how much we spend on gene-editing techniques”. Franziska Achterberg, Greenpeace EU’s food policy director, said the court’s ruling had prioritised the protection of human health and the environment. “Releasing these new GMOs into the environment without proper safety measures is illegal and irresponsible,” she said, “particularly given that gene editing can lead to unintended side effects. The European commission and European governments must now ensure that all new GMOs are fully tested and labelled, and that any field trials are brought under GMO rules.”",https://media.guim.co.uk/f35b887dbbf74d651c32a66831db2c305a66258f/0_253_5760_3456/500.jpg,0.013637658637658628

Gluten-free products are soaring in popularity around the world. Global sales rose by 12.6% to hit $3.5bn, between 2016 and 2017 compared with 4% for packaged foods generally, according to Euromonitor. Gluten-free diets are medically advised for people suffering from the digestive condition coeliac disease, but most of the growth in sales is among people who do not need to eat gluten-free foods. According to the study, a Gallup poll in 2015 in the US reported that one in five consumers said they actively try to include gluten-free foods in their diet. Some celebrities have endorsed them for weight-loss. The new research in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics among young adults aged 25 to 36 in Minnesota in the US found that many choose gluten-free because of its “health halo” – the perception that it is better for you. Other labels that have a similar health halo include “low sodium”, “natural” or “free from” artificial additives. Of 1,819 of these young adults who are enrolled in a long-term study called Project Eat, 13% said they valued gluten-free foods. They tended to be people who also valued organic, locally-grown, non-GMO, and not processed foods, the survey found, and had a weight goal – usually to lose weight although a few (usually young men) hoped to gain weight. But while many ate in a very healthy way, having breakfast and eating lots of fruit and vegetables, others were potentially doing themselves harm by smoking, taking diet pills and making themselves vomit. Those who engaged in such unhealthy behaviours were three times more likely to value gluten-free foods than those who ate well, the survey found. “I have concerns about the increasing number of people who perceive that eating a gluten-free diet is a healthier way to eat. Of particular concern is the higher risk for those engaging in unhealthy weight control practices for perceiving a gluten-free diet as important, given that eating gluten-free may be viewed as a ‘socially acceptable way’ to restrict intake that may not be beneficial for overall health,” said lead investigator Prof Dianne Neumark-Sztainer, head of the division of epidemiology and community health at the University of Minnesota. “If there is a need for eating gluten-free, then it is important to avoid foods with gluten. Otherwise, a dietary pattern that includes a variety of foods, with a large emphasis on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, is recommended for optimal health.” The researchers also worry that people who go for gluten-free and other so-called healthier foods may over-eat, assuming that you can’t have too much of a good thing. “Products labeled as ‘low sodium,’ ‘natural,’ and ‘free from’ certain food components or characteristics may be interpreted by consumers as being healthier overall,” said lead author Mary J. Christoph of the university’s department of paediatrics. “The health halo effect can have unintended consequences on eating habits, such as people over-consuming because they believe they have chosen a healthier product.” The paper points out that gluten-free foods are also expensive and says there is no reason to recommend them. “Young adults should be advised that eating gluten-free products may not improve weight or health,” it says. Gluten is a protein found in grains such as wheat, barley and rye. Plenty of healthy foods, such as fruit and vegetables, contain no gluten. The concern is over gluten-free substitute packaged foods, which can be high in calories, saturated fats and salt. A big US study published last year found that avoiding whole grains in order not to eat gluten could lead to an increased risk of heart disease. “The promotion of gluten-free diets among people without coeliac disease should not be encouraged,” concluded the study in the British Medical Journal.",https://media.guim.co.uk/b99558c1b2f052e95d03151765eb3a511326075b/0_0_5220_3132/500.jpg,0.10770911883815111

But do you really need to carry your pet bunny instead of a bouquet and hashtag the hell out of the big day?</p>",2018,"Before we go any further, it is perhaps worth noting that Britain’s divorce rate hovers not far below 50%. I mention this simply to remind you, as the wedding season rears up once more, that not all unions end safely and happily. And, perhaps more pressingly, because this means that in 10 years’ time there is a high chance you won’t give a monkey’s about floral arrangements, seating plans or whether or not you served non-GMO seitan in your vegan canapes. Still, at this time of year, and with a royal wedding now tantalisingly close, it is worth considering how much weddings have changed in the past few years. These days, most of us get married later – 35 for women and 37 for men – often after years of cohabitation and frequently after parenthood. We have same-sex weddings, friends as celebrants, male bridesmaids, divorced in-laws, second marriages, pies instead of fruitcake, and weddings on submarines and beaches and the London Eye, all of which demands a new kind of wedding etiquette. Should llamas or other animals be included in the wedding party? Let us consider the cautionary tale of Jeni Arrowsmith and Mark Wood, a couple from Wrexham who recently hired an owl to deliver their wedding rings. Sadly, after Bobby the barn owl had made his flight across the church, the waiting best man struggled to unclip the rings from his claw. Bobby became agitated and, distracted by an arm movement, descended on one of the groomsmen, who happened to have a terrible fear of birds. Despite the chance of such rogue turn of events, an increasing number of couples do choose to involve animals in their weddings, particularly their own pets. “Dogs are very common now, especially at the festival, boho, outside weddings,” says Kat Williams, the founder of the alternative wedding blog Rock n Roll Bride. Williams recalls a bride who walked down the aisle carrying her pet rabbit rather than a bouquet, and tells how her own sister employed a small herd of llamas to greet guests at her reception. But it is important to remember that the wellbeing of your beasts remains the priority – they should be fed, watered and cared for, and, should you be hiring them just for the day, you have a responsibility to investigate the credentials of the company you contract. Finally, keep in mind the solemn words of Anne-Marie Curtis, the editor-in-chief of Elle Wedding: “Introducing animals to a wedding can overcomplicate something that is already quite complicated.” Do bridesmaids have to wear identical dresses (even if it only suits one or two of them)? One of the principal duties of bridesmaids used to be to confuse evil spirits and jealous suitors who might try to snaffle away the bride before she could even say her vows. They did this by cunningly dressing identically to the bride and similarly veiling their faces. Today, they perform the same duty more subtly – by wearing matching satin 50s numbers from Monsoon and mainlining enough prosecco to become incomprehensible by 7pm. Nevertheless, some brides have begun to break with convention here. “Some people do still want to have six child bridesmaids scattering rose petals,” says Curtis, “but you can also just have one friend,” and this could be a male friend. Williams notes the identical dresses are also on the wane, and these days “the mismatched look is really popular. So you might choose the same dress in different colours, or pick a colour and let your bridesmaids choose a dress style that fits their shape.” That should certainly keep the evil spirits on their toes. How risque should the wedding speeches be? In the good old days you knew exactly where you were with speeches: a few tender words, thanks, and compliments to the bridesmaids from the groom, a misty-eyed tribute from the father of the bride, and a kind but fruity performance from the best man with no more than three allusions to previous girlfriends and whatever may or may not have gone on during the stag weekend in Magaluf. It was the point in a wedding day where guests could sit back and wonder at the simple glory of men speaking, very much like a boardroom meeting, or party conference, or a BBC panel game or, well, most situations in life ever. Sadly, since approximately 2014, women have been tiresomely harping on about their right to speak too, and now weddings frequently feature speeches from brides, bridesmaids and brides’ mothers. “Generally, weddings are events where you attend to tradition, but a lot of brides are questioning and challenging that tradition,” says Lucy Hume, an associate director at Debrett’s, which offers a wedding handbook and consultancy service. She advises that, especially if the wedding features more than three speakers, “ideally your speech should last around 10 minutes”. For anyone giving a best man or best woman’s speech, it is best to avoid props. “It’s always the best men who get out the PowerPoint presentation and everyone groans,” says Williams. “I think that’s on the way out.” And as far as risque anecdotes are concerned, she believes most guests are fairly unshockable these days. Still, she says, a good rule of thumb is: “Is the bride or groom going to kill you? Because it’s a fine line between embarrassing them and mortifying them.” Should you ban phones and social media? Getting married in a technological age throws up many conundrums. Should you liveblog your vows? Ought you to invite Alexa to the wedding? Chief among them is the role of mobile phones and social media. Some couples opt for entirely phone-free weddings, while others encourage you to hashtag the hell out of the nuptials. “There’s no official etiquette,” says Hume. “Except when it comes to the ceremony, and then the celebrant may ask guests not to take photographs.” And some of it is plain common sense – what bride wants to see a video of herself dancing to Cardi B on a trestle table at 3am with the caption #helenandsuewed? Williams notes the futility of guests recording the ceremony on their phones: “It’s like being at a gig and there’s a sea of phones and you think, ‘When are you ever going to watch that?’” And it is perhaps best to ignore the whole idea of social media. “I think the pressure to post on the day adds a whole level of stress,” says Curtis. “And you really want to immerse yourself in the day itself.” Still, says Williams, “A social media ban is a bit harsh. It’s not the Met Gala.” Is it acceptable to set up a wedding list if you’re already living together? It is easy to forget that in the olden days couples did not live together before marriage, setting up home together only after the big day. Wedding gift lists hail from this time and were designed to soften the blow when you realised that you had committed yourself to a lifetime with a man who eats with his mouth open, or a woman who sniffs – quietly, perhaps, but with the soul-destroying persistence of a dripping tap. Do gift lists really have any place in the modern world where most couples cohabit before they marry? “It really depends what life stage you’re at,” says Curtis. “It’s not necessarily about needing to set up house, but I think as a rule some kind of list can be helpful to guests.” Asking for cold hard cash is unfortunately still a touch outre. “There is still a resistance to people asking for it,” says Hume, although Williams points out that some wedding-list sites offer a monetary option. “If it goes through a company it feels less like you’re asking for cash in an envelope,” she says. Alternatively, you could suggest guests make donations to charity – although this can bring its own issues. For instance, my ex-husband and I are still joint owners of a small copse in east Lancashire as a result of our effort to hold a carbon-neutral wedding by encouraging guests to give to a tree-planting charity. We have not discussed visitation rights. Should you have an expensive, elaborate stag or hen do? Hen and stag dos are, according to Williams, “more popular than ever”, with some brides and grooms choosing to have more than one – a thought frankly more terrifying for the residents of Blackpool than the prospect of fracking on the Fylde coast. The thing to remember, says Curtis, is that hen or stag dos need not be expensive, elaborative or exclusive. “In this time-poor age, a hen or a stag do can be a nice way to spend time together, but everyone should be in agreement; you have to make sure everybody’s comfortable and everybody’s having fun.” This extends, of course, to those employed to assist your event, be that the model in your life-drawing class, the waitress at your dinner or any member of the Chippendales. Such occasions are not an excuse to act like a boorish wazzock, even if you are dressed as She-Ra and chained to a unicycle. Should you choreograph your first dance? Approximately five years ago, surprise choreography became an almost inescapable part of wedding theatre – brides backflipping down the aisle, flashmobs, first dances where the ballad screeched to a halt and the happy couple suddenly launched into an elaborately well-rehearsed routine to Sir Mix-a-Lot. Indeed, it is now something of a relief for an entire wedding dance to go by without a romantic Uptown Funk breakout. “Maybe we have reached peak first dance,” says Hume, although she adds that there is really nothing wrong with a couple taking a preparatory class or two if they feel nervous about dancing in front of their guests. The performative moments of a wedding are a result of not just our wearisome social media age, but, says Curtis, an increasing pressure for couples to make their weddings feel more personal. “We’re all much bigger showoffs than we used to be,” she says. “And making a wedding more personal can become harder because there are no rules to follow. In some ways, it might have been easier when the bride’s parents paid for everything and you all trundled off down to the local church. But, you know, the best parts of any wedding are always the unchoreographed, unplanned moments.” Is it OK for a wedding to be child-free? Williams says that one of the questions she is most frequently asked by prospective brides is how to tell guests that their wedding will be child-free. “Children get bored, they need entertaining, and having them there can cost as much as having an adult guest.” Child-free weddings are increasingly common, and she advises making sure that this is stated on the invitation, telephoning any guests who might particularly object. For those who do invite children, be prepared to accommodate breastfeeding, potty-training, high chairs and perhaps squalling tantrums of boredom during Paul’s Letter to the Corinthians (although, in many ways, perhaps they will be speaking for everyone). How can you keep all the divorced parents and step-parents happy? Any knotty family matters – divorced parents, old feuds, disapproval of a same-sex union – should be approached kindly and openly well before the big day. “Divorced parents are one of the common challenges people come to us for advice about,” says Hume. “We advocate a frank, open conversation from the outset.” She often suggests couples find a way for step-parents to be involved: one parent walking a bride down the aisle and another giving the speech, for instance. “Weddings are emotional subjects and you can be surprised by how excited people can get about them,” she says. Any guest who doesn’t respect the occasion should be treated in much the same way as that tantrumming toddler stropping their way through the ceremony: take them outside and give them a calm but firm talking to, well away from other guests. Remember that a wedding is about making sure everyone feels welcome, about celebration and love – things that it is sometimes easy to forget amid all the hashtags, wedding lists and barn owls.",https://media.guim.co.uk/c20d0ac30d5476c1757b6f1ff92b79503275bf49/0_365_5472_3283/500.jpg,0.14672746813371815

Fuhgeddaboudit, say New Yorkers after California ruling",https://gu.com/p/8bneb,Lifestyle,"Give up coffee? Fuhgeddaboudit, say New Yorkers after California ruling",<p>A California judge has ruled that coffee companies must put cancer warnings on their product but caffeine-crazed drinkers on the east coast aren’t buying the latest health scare</p>,745,"Asking a New Yorker whether they’ll give up their morning coffee during their commute is likely to elicit only one response – laughter. News broke on Thursday that a California judge had ruled coffee companies should carry cancer warnings on their products after an eight-year legal battle with big coffee. Coffee companies, led by Starbucks, had argued that the levels of acrylamide, a known carcinogen, present in their coffee were insignificant and outweighed by health benefits. But the defendants “failed to satisfy their burden of proving by a preponderance of evidence that consumption of coffee confers a benefit to human health”, Elihu Berle, a superior court judge, ruled. “While plaintiff offered evidence that consumption of coffee increases the risk of harm to the fetus, to infants, to children and to adults, defendants’ medical and epidemiology experts testified that they had no opinion on causation.” Harm to fetuses, infants, children, adults? Sounds scary. But not to New Yorkers. Three thousand miles away from the California court the reaction ranged from “meh” to “fuhgeddaboudit”. “California!” said Jarrett Boor, an architect winging his way to work on 8th Avenue in Manhattan. “They put warning labels on everything.” He said it was good in some cases and that the public should know when products are dangerous. “But everything causes cancer: cellphones, GMO foods. I’m not giving up my coffee,” he snorted. New Yorkers do, apparently, drink a ridiculous amount of coffee. A survey by health data website Massive Health calculated the city was running on 6.7 times as much coffee per person as other cities (San Franciscans, by contrast, eat 4.4 times as many brussels sprouts). Given the amount of joe coursing through a New Yorker’s system it’s little wonder that the city’s hopped-up workers don’t seem too worried by California’s warnings. According to a Harvard study, roughly 62% of Americans drink coffee every day, an all-time high. And, despite the fly California has dropped in the nation’s latte, two decades of research suggests that coffee is good for us, helping to reduce the risk of illnesses ranging from cancer to heart disease to Alzheimer’s. One common complaint among caffeine-loving New Yorkers on Friday was that they were sick of the ever-changing buffet of health-related coffee news. “The last public health statement I saw was coffee was good for you. It reduces hypertension,” said Marge Wetzler, wearily waiting for a medium iced latte in Gregory’s Coffee in midtown Manhattan. “Now it’s bad for you? I just don’t buy that.” She would, however, continue to buy her morning coffee. “Whatever,” said James Warren, a bike courier picking up a Starbucks between stops. “It’s bad for you, it’s good for you, it’s bad for you, it’s good for you. It’s kinda irritating,” he said before dashing out into traffic. New Yorkers’ attitudes were echoed 3,000 miles away in Los Angeles. “I just don’t think it would stop me,” Jen Bitterman, a digital marketing technologist, told the Associated Press. “I love the taste, I love the ritual, I love the high, the energy, and I think I’m addicted to it.” Lawyer Darlington Ibekwe agreed. “It’s like cigarettes. Like, damn, now I’ve got to see this?” he said. “Dude, I’m enjoying my coffee.” Berle’s ruling could spell bad news for coffee companies. The third phase of the California trial, brought by non-profit organization the Council for Education and Research on Toxics, will determine any civil penalties that coffee companies must pay. The potential penalties are massive, if unlikely, with a fine of up to $2,500 per person exposed each day over eight years. California has 40 million residents. While it’s extremely doubtful that coffee will face the same kinds of penalties slapped on the tobacco companies, the case does open up the possibility of a world without coffee. “There would have to be an alternative,” said Ali Philippides, a product manager at the Daily Beast. Commuting into work with her ridiculously cute corgi, Fig, Philippides was gripping a Starbucks cappuccino and looked a little shaken by the cancer news. “I used to drink a lot of Diet Coke and swapped for seltzer,” she said thoughtfully. But could she give up coffee? As she paused to think for a moment you could almost see the post-apocalyptic dystopia of a coffee-free New York reflected in her eyes. Riots on the L train, Union Square on fire – a city mad with withdrawal. Fig looked up at her with concern. “Could I give up coffee?” she repeated. “No.”",https://media.guim.co.uk/456fbb735dca2f3ba353da19327fc1413a8cc9a1/0_192_5760_3456/500.jpg,0.0261951381951382

Cambridge Analytica’s boasts about covert work to get Donald Trump elected are fuelling outrage against Facebook, while MPs have demanded an explanation in person from Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of the social network. Calls to #DeleteFacebook are being echoed widely, with the WhatsApp cofounder Brian Acton among those joining the campaign. Data from at least 50m users was harvested from Facebook profiles and then used by Cambridge Analytica for its secretive campaigns. Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, Alexander Nix, has been suspended after being caught on undercover video bragging about the type of “unattributable and untrackable” methods used to support clients, including unbranded advertising and self-destructing emails. Of the Trump campaign, he said: “We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting. We ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy.” Mark Turnbull, the head of Cambridge Analytica’s political division, took credit for the “Defeat Crooked Hillary” campaign, which was run through a Trump-aligned “political action committee” (Pac). Company staff described how their work was cloaked behind Pacs that carried out the “air war” for the Trump campaign – a form of collaboration that could be illegal under US election law. Cambridge University, meanwhile, has sought assurances from Facebook that one of its academics, Aleksandr Kogan, did not use university resources when he mined user data that was passed on to Cambridge Analytica. Kogan told the Today programme on Radio 4 this morning that he is being made a scapegoat by both companies, and that Cambridge Analytica had approached him to develop his data-harvesting Facebook app, not the other way around. * * * ‘Big fireball and smoke’ – A Red Arrows plane has crashed, killing an RAF engineer who was on board. The pilot ejected and survived when the Hawk jet came down at RAF valley air base in north Wales on Tuesday afternoon. Witnesses described seeing the plane at an odd angle as it approached the runway before crashing in a fireball. Names have not yet been released after what the RAF described as a “tragic accident”. The last Red Arrows fatality occurred in November 2011 when Flt Lt Sean Cunningham was accidentally ejected from his Hawk aircraft while sitting on the runway, then plunged to his death when the parachute failed to open. * * * ‘The work of Putin’s circle’ – Exiled Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky says he lives with the knowledge that Vladimir Putin could kill him if he wanted to. The former Yukos oil group head and critic of Putin says the British government needs to target not the whole of Russia and its government, but the “criminal group” surrounding the president, over the Salisbury poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal with a “novichok” nerve agent invented in Russia. “The Russian government is not involved in this,” he said. The targeting of Skripal was a clear case of retribution towards a defector, said Khodorkovsky, who lives in London. * * * Anger over self-driving Uber death – Friends of a woman fatally hit by a robotic Uber car have called for the company to be shut down as punishment. Elaine Herzberg, 49, was walking her bicycle on a road in Tempe, Arizona, when she was struck by the Volvo SUV. “This shouldn’t have ever happened,” said Carole Kimmerle, a friend of Herzberg. A human driver was on board but not in control of the car at the time, raising questions about why the car did not detect and automatically avoid Herzberg. Uber said it was suspending its self-driving operations in several cities but did not comment further. * * * Quick catch-up – Here is your mid-week booster shot of news. &gt; Donald Trump and the EU supremo Jean-Claude Juncker are drawing fire for congratulating Vladimir Putin on his heavily orchestrated election win. As Britain expelled Russian diplomats over the Salisbury attack, the EU Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, shot back at Juncker: “This is no time for congratulations.” &gt; The government has abandoned plans to force a million NHS staff to give up a day’s holiday in return for ending the pay cap. Unions appear poised to recommend the pay rise deal to members in England. &gt; Stephen Hawking’s ashes will be interred at Westminster Abbey near the grave of Sir Isaac Newton.

Lunchtime read: Corbyn’s Labour – a party of one An uncompromising political leader, in total control, invulnerable to challenge for the foreseeable future. We are not talking of Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping – but of Jeremy Corbyn who, writes Heather Stewart, now enjoys complete control of the Labour party machine. Our political editor writes that Jennie Formby’s coronation as Labour general secretary is the culmination of a two-year battle by Corbyn’s camp to push supportive candidates into every key party post. While “all Labour leaders have sought to stamp their imprint on the party”, the extent of Corbyn’s success in doing so has rung alarm bells. “Labour has always prided itself on being a broad church,” says one insider. “Now ideology is the most important thing and to hell with skills, experience, the time and work you put in.” Sport England’s longest cricket tour for more than half a century enters its final phase in Auckland on Thursday with captain Joe Root desperate to salvage something from a trip tainted by the Ashes series defeat to Australia. Rory McIlroy has admitted Sunday’s long-awaited victory at the Arnold Palmer Invitational supplied the “validation” he can draw upon ahead of another Masters tilt. The physical strain on England’s leading players shows little sign of easing with the Premiership champions Exeter resigned to losing Jack Nowell and Harry Williams for several more weeks and the Champions’ Cup holders Saracens unsure if Billy Vunipola will be fit to feature in next month’s European quarter-final against Leinster in Dublin.

28,article,film/2018/mar/16/paradox-review-neil-young-daryl-hannah-western-sxsw-film-netflix,Film,2018-03-16,Paradox review – Neil Young croons through Daryl Hannah's rambling western,https://gu.com/p/89dfn,Arts,Paradox review – Neil Young croons through Daryl Hannah's rambling western,<p>Hannah directs the rocker in a dreamy fantasy for Netflix about futuristic outlaws on the hunt for old technology</p>,692,"Trading the spotlight for the director’s chair, Daryl Hannah teams up with her partner, musician Neil Young, to helm a fantasy western musical. Made between Young’s tour stops, Paradox is a chance for Hannah to experiment with film-making and a behind-the-scenes look at Young rehearsing with his band, Promise of the Real. It’s a wild journey that is difficult for outsiders to follow if they’re new to either her activist career or to Young’s music. Most of Paradox features collage shots of nature and the musicians traipsing through it. Young and his band exaggerate their stage personas and improvise their lines. The film’s loose, rambling story is set in the future, where men and women are separated until a full moon unites them. The men are prospectors looking for old technology, and must wander the frontier looking for things to trade with the women, who harvest food somewhere off-screen. The story weaves and bobs between musical interludes, where the real action occurs. As the Man in the Black Hat, Young doesn’t say much but provides most of the background music. His band are a misfit group of young musicians and steely old-timers, who trade quips over dinner and games. For the most part, the group lies about, waiting for something to happen. The film’s energy doesn’t pick up until the rest of them pick up instruments alongside their leader. Paradox has a haphazard sense of style, mixing old and new fashions together like children playing dress up. While a few of the characters would fit in a Peckinpah western, cowboy jacket and beard intact, the younger musicians seem to have stepped out of a steampunk convention. Young’s defining characteristic is simply his hat, while most of the women, for whom the men pine, wear white, lacy prairie dresses. That mix of aesthetics is also visible in the film’s shooting style, a harsh mix of 16mm and digital formats. The celluloid bits are light and airy, used to give the movie a dreamy feel, as rays of light burn bright pink and colours blur together. However, most of the movie is shot in the staccato of digital, where lines are sharp and everything looks too real to be a dream. Occasionally, a filter is applied to make things seem unreal. The frequent switch between the three styles can be disorienting. The reaches of the story are too large for the film’s humble budget and limited means. It wants to be a lyrical futuristic tone poem but comes off as confusing. There are oblique references to things in Hannah’s life that aren’t fully explained, like the women’s obsessions with the seeds of their vegetables. Later, I learned its meaning was rooted in Hannah’s activism against GMO farming. Paradox unmistakably romanticises the myth of the old west. The Man in the Black Hat owes just as much to Clint Eastwood’s Man With No Name as he does to Johnny Cash’s Man in Black. There are plenty of shots of campfires, horses, and men idling around old wooden houses and tipis – but no Native Americans. The sole Mexican character moves from caricature to stereotype almost as soon as he’s on screen, arriving in a serape and a colourful sombrero hanging off his horse’s saddle. Either way, it’s likely Young’s fans will enjoy watching him rehearse. The progression is slow, but there is suspense. No one wants to be the one to disrupt the Man in the Black Hat’s groove. Later, Willie Nelson makes a cameo as another bandit opposite his old pal. Unfortunately, it’s all too brief. I know the film is billed as Hannah’s directorial debut, but I hope it’s just a warm-up. She’s clearly interested in telling stories she’s passionate about, like her partner’s music and environmental activism. But Paradox is choppy and directionless, better seen as an experimental concert film that attempted to do something more ambitious than the average music video. •Paradox is released on Netflix on 23 March. • This article was amended on 16 March 2017 to correct the description of Daryl Hannah’s activism, which opposes GMO (genetically modified organisms) farming rather than non-GMO farming as an earlier version said.",https://media.guim.co.uk/9bcaf706dd9a086aa553a218b199274d8d5a06bf/0_0_950_570/500.jpg,0.07074479018923462
29,article,books/2018/feb/22/skin-in-the-game-nassim-nicholas-taleb-review,Books,2018-02-22,Skin in the Game by Nassim Nicholas Taleb review – how risk should be shared,https://gu.com/p/84nzy,Arts,Skin in the Game by Nassim Nicholas Taleb review – how risk should be shared,"<p>Hawkish politicians and reckless bankers never face the consequences of their actions – but they should, according to this arresting but flawed book</p>",1275,"Skin in the Game is Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s fifth book. He presents it sometimes as part of a triptych with his earlier works The Black Swan and Antifragile, and at other times as a continuation, each book “just as Eve came out of Adam’s ribs”, seeding the central idea of the next. The Black Swan, a soaraway success praised for its prophetic power and intense relevance, looked – just before the financial crash of 2007 – at “high-impact, unexpected” events; at those disasters that result when you underestimate the complexity of systems and, at its simplest, when you assume that because you’ve never seen one, black swans don’t exist. Antifragile, which had more of a pop-philosophy feel, advised how to take advantage of modern randomness and volatility. Skin in the Game has more in common, in the way its ideas are structured and their application, with Black Swan. Yet a style runs strong and consistent through each of the three books, trenchant beyond all imagining, and is its own kind of wit. Every economist, journalist, book reviewer, professor, anyone who is not part of an “active and transactional life” is an inveterate idiot, unless he or she is one of a handful Taleb respects, who also seem to be his very close friends. “I am never bothered by normal people,” he says, though given the emphasis he puts on his “fuck-off” wealth, the reader might be permitted to wonder how many normal people he engages with. “It is the bull***tter in the ‘intellectual’ profession who bothers me. Seeing the psychologist Steven Pinker making pronouncements about things intellectual has a similar effect to encountering a drive-in Burger King while hiking in the middle of a national park ” Taleb is riotously discourteous and extremely thin skinned, still taking issue in his footnotes with the negative review he received in this paper for Antifragile. The effect is arresting: it can be extremely good fun. The combination of fearlessness, self-belief and immodesty adds up to charisma on the page; Taleb is the festival messiah you’d follow into a river until the drugs wore off. The argument of the new book is also immediately attractive: if you have no skin in the game, you shouldn’t be in the game. “If you give an opinion, and someone follows it, you are morally obligated to be, yourself, exposed to its consequences.” Hawks in the White House should not be taking decisions about bombs in Iraq when they will remain in their air-conditioned houses with their 2.2 children whatever the result. Bankers are in the “Bob Rubin trade”, named after the former secretary of the US Treasury, who “collected more than $120 million in compensation from Citibank in the decade preceding the banking crash of 2008. When the bank, literally insolvent, was rescued by the taxpayer, he didn’t write any cheque – he invoked uncertainty as an excuse. Heads he wins, tails he shouts ‘Black Swan’.” There are fools of randomness and crooks of randomness, but Taleb’s corrective is the same: they must have skin in the game. This is needed to ensure they think well, so that they learn from their mistakes, and because systems learn and species evolve by weeding out failure. Those who don’t succeed must face ruin, or death (this dances around a bit, as correctives will when you’re ranging freely in your references between a lecture agent who once pissed you off and the ancient text of Hammurabi); whatever, something bad. So far, so appealing: most sensible people have agreed for some time that bankers need personal liability if they’re going to make responsible choices. Perhaps already it sounds too broad; yes, doctors have skin in the game, having professional pride and reputation, severe legal consequences for error, a deep understanding of complex systems, and centuries of accrued ethical standards. But the proposition that bureaucrats, being separated from the consequences of their decisions (no skin in the game), are the ultimate social ill is hard to sustain; if you accept that systems are complex, then subsidiarity – devolving decisions down to the lowest civic level at which they can be made, where everyone’s skin is involved – can only be a partial solution. The statement that “the most egregious contributor to inequality is the condition of a high-ranking civil servant or tenured academic, not that of an entrepreneur” is very easily falsifiable by referring to the real motor of inequality, the distribution of profits between capital and labour, driven by chief executives and shareholders who want values maximised – people whose skin is very much in the game of driving down wages. There’s a case to be made for balance. You wouldn’t want homicide law to be written by the mother of a murdered child. It’s in this book’s details that the flaws reveal themselves. “Prince Andrew,” we learn, “took more risks than ‘commoners’ during the Falkland [sic] war of 1982, his helicopter being in the front line. Why? Because noblesse oblige; the very status of a lord has been traditionally derived from protecting others.” If this gels with nothing you’ve ever thought or heard about Prince Andrew, it’s because it’s not true. He did fly a helicopter, so it was certainly more dangerous than not going to war at all; but the Argentinians had scant anti-aircraft capability. The ground was far more fraught with risk. A section on how a whole population can submit to the preferences of a tiny, stubborn minority is fascinating only from a great distance. Taleb hypothesises a family of four in which one member will only eat non-genetically modified food. It is easier for the whole family to go that way; soon, because of barbecues and whatnot, the neighbourhood starts to buy non-GMO to accommodate them, the shop starts to sell only that food, and so on. The least flexible dominate the most, because the former will only eat some things while the latter will eat anything. Then we learn that in the UK, “where the (practising) Muslim population is only 3% to 4%, a very high proportion of the meat we find is halal. Close to 70% of lamb imports from New Zealand are halal. Close to 10% of Subway stores carry halal-only meat (meaning no pork), in spite of the high costs of losing the business of ham eaters (like myself).” In fact, New Zealand produces halal lamb almost exclusively (98%), because of trade deals with the Middle East, and Subway’s halal stores are part of a policy since 2007 to take account of the local demographic when opening, resulting in 200-odd stores in north-east London, Birmingham and other places where the average Subway shopper is far more likely to be Muslim than 3%. Taleb’s conclusion – via some other observations on tolerance, religion and politics – that the “West is currently in the process of committing suicide” is just silly. More saliently, it goes against his own precepts: every idea that sounds as if it might work in the abstract fails in the particular, and more to the point, he has no skin in this game. He’s not the one who has to get on a bus wearing a hijab and be yelled at by some partially educated thug who didn’t want his rogan josh to be halal. In one section, Taleb reveals the best advice he ever received, which was not to have an assistant: it is slightly incongruous, neither reinforcing, exemplifying nor adding complexity to his argument. But it is enlightening in one sense: it might help if he got one. • Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life is published by Allen Lane.

The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) is distributing the fast-growing, high-yield Nabe 15 super bean, which refugees can plant immediately to replenish their stocks. The bean, which is not genetically modified, was developed by scientists at the National Agricultural Research Organisation of Uganda, in collaboration with the Colombia-based International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (Ciat). “Uganda is currently overwhelmed by the high number of refugees, especially those from South Sudan. Humanitarian partners are finding it difficult to maintain the rations of food assistance necessary per household,” said Beatrice Okello, senior programme manager at the FAO in Uganda. “It is important that other sources of food be found to complement the food assistance.” Uganda hosts more than 1 million refugees from South Sudan. Lack of funds led the World Food Programme to cut food rations last year. Now the FAO and its partners are distributing the beans, along with seeds for the staple crops of maize, beans and various vegetables. The new variety is sourced from the Kawanda gene bank, run by the Pan-Africa Bean Research Alliance. “The majority [of refugees] come from an agricultural background … Providing the seeds helps them to restart a livelihood for their household and ensure food security,” Okello said. Andie Lambe, executive director at International Refugee Rights Initiative, said that most of the people the organisation had spoken to were keen to improve their self-sufficiency. “They do not want to be indefinite, passive recipients of aid,” she said. The Nabe 15 bean has already been tested among farmers in Uganda’s northern region, who reported an increase in harvests using the new variety. The FAO estimates that up to 2,000kg of beans per hectare can be grown from 50kg of seeds. The crop takes between 60 and 70 days to mature, compared with many local bean varieties that can take between 80 and 90 days. The bean is considered tastier and more resilient to pests and disease than local varieties. It is a space-efficient variety, according to Okello, important for refugees farming small plots. “It also grows almost everywhere. Some of the land allocated to the refugees is not very conducive for production but this variety of beans does relatively well on it. “Both in its fresh and dry form it swells when cooked, increasing the amount to be eaten, and cooks fast, without consuming a lot of scarce wood fuel.” Refugees arriving in Uganda were originally allocated about half an acre of land to grow crops and supplement the food aid they receive, and were given materials to build a basic home. However, because of the huge numbers of people crossing the border, fleeing the continuing violence in South Sudan, only around half now have access to arable land. Lambe said she was hearing stories of refugees returning to ongoing conflict areas as a result of inadequate services in host countries, describing it as “a worrying development”. “If we are struggling to provide even this most basic of services, we are obviously failing in our collective responsibility and need to address this deficiency quickly to ensure that refugees are not forced into taking drastic action to support themselves and their families,” she said. Lambe said more long-term solutions were needed, such as greater integration into communities. “This could include, for example, micro-loans to enable entrepreneurship and diversity of training and skills development based on a market analysis of needs in the community,” she said.",https://media.guim.co.uk/64e0b61f05d19adc88670546f8a0f8bbfe9a2061/0_400_6000_3600/500.jpg,0.13517171717171717

We ask two respected fund managers: what’s next?",1686,"Shares are expensive – keep buying them. That appears to be investors’ consensus view. The storming run for stock markets in 2017 seemed almost too good to be trusted, but 2018 has started in similar style. In the US, the Dow Jones industrial average soared past 25,000 last week, almost exactly 12 months after 20,000 was achieved. In the UK, the FTSE 100 index stands at a record high. Even the Japanese market, for years an international laggard, is back at a 26-year high. Last year the MSCI World index – a proxy for a global stock market – delivered a return of 20.1%. Optimists expect more of the same. The other camp warns that a dangerous bubble is about to burst. Both sides could probably agree that the recent run in stock markets has been astonishing. Or, rather, the truly remarkable feature has been the steady and unbroken pace of the march upwards. Stock markets, we used to think, offered thrills, spills and rollercoaster rides. Individual shares still provide such excitement, of course, but the overall market seems bizarrely free of stress. Andrew Lapthorne, who crunches the market numbers for French bank Société Générale, called 2017 “the year volatility died” in his end-of-year round-up. He wrote: “Those of us expecting greater market turbulence in 2017 could not have been more wrong. Not only did global equity markets perform well, but they did so with such low volatility and consistency that, if this were a fund, it would perhaps merit a visit from the authorities to check exactly what you were up to.” What happened? First, investors seem to have decided that rising interest rates in the US, a big worry a year ago, are not the bogeyman they seemed. The US Federal Reserve has been a protective nurse. Rate rises have been gradual, and ultra-cheap money has been followed by very cheap. A US rate of 1.5% ain’t so bad. Second, President Donald Trump’s administration, amid its chaos and crises, has delivered the policy investors in companies cared about most: corporate tax cuts. Maybe a growth-generating splurge on infrastructure, the second part of his economic agenda, will follow. There are no certainties in investment, but the “nothing to worry about” theory is plainly credible. Kenneth Taubes, chief US investment officer at Amundi, Europe’s largest asset manager, reckons the US reforms are “significant” and “not fully priced into the market”. “Looking into 2018, we believe that the concerns about a bubble for US equities are overdone,” he says. “Compared to past crises [2000, 2007], we don’t see excess in terms of flows. Mergers and acquisitions will likely revive and support the market now that the tax reform has been legislated. Financial conditions are still benign. We expect that the combined impact of an improving US economy, a stronger global economy and lower taxes will support earnings per share growth.” That won’t silence those who worry about a bubble. On hard and traditional measures such as dividend yields, the US shares look plain over-valued. Prices have climbed so high that the average yield on stocks in the S&amp;P 500, the broadest US index, has slipped below 2%. That implies huge faith in companies’ ability to crank up dividends even further, despite profit margins already being fat. Or take your pick of any number of signs of market madness elsewhere: the Bitcoin craze; or the fact that European junk bonds, which are supposed to be high risk, were yielding less than safe-as-houses US Treasury notes last month. Amid it all, geopolitics seems to have been forgotten. North Korea? Iran? Saudi Arabia? An imploding US presidency? A Chinese slowdown? None has upset financial markets – yet. Accurately predicting the timing of the bursting of the bubble, if it exists, is tricky, of course, which is why the forecast of a possible “melt-up” by the normally cautious Jeremy Grantham is so intriguing (see below). Is a melt-up – a last wild fling for highly valued markets – credible? It’s certainly plausible because it’s happened in the past. To many minds, the dotcom mania seemed crazed in 1998. Then the US tech-heavy Nasdaq index gained 85% in 1999 before the inevitable crash arrived in 2000. Silly things happen in financial markets. ‘Inflated asset prices and valuations:’ Neil Woodford Neil Woodford, Britain’s best-known fund manager and a proud contrarian, spent 2017 becoming increasingly sceptical about valuations in many areas of the stock markets. By the end of the year – a poor one for his funds – he was convinced an unsustainable investment bubble had formed and was about to burst. “Ten years on from the global financial crisis, we are witnessing the product of the biggest monetary policy experiment in history,” he wrote. “Investors have forgotten about risk and this is playing out in inflated asset prices and inflated valuations … There are so many lights flashing red that I am losing count.” One flashing light was the extreme difference between the performance of US “value” stocks – the type of reliable profit and dividend-earners he tends to prefer – and “growth” companies. The disparity was “greater than at any stage in stock market history”, Woodford said – yes, even including the 1929 Wall Street crash. Woodford, who manages £15bn, famously sat out the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s and cleaned up afterwards. He sees echoes of those days but thinks there are more similarities with the “Nifty Fifty” bubble in US markets in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which was led by companies such as Coca-Cola and IBM. “The few stocks that are perceived to be capable of delivering dependable growth have become very popular, and that popularity has manifested itself in extreme and unsustainable valuations,” he argues. He has sold a few beneficiaries of this trend, such as household and healthcare group Reckitt Benckiser, on the grounds that it is a good but overvalued company. He sees opportunity in domestically focused UK stocks, just as he did in 1992 after the sterling devaluation that followed the UK’s chaotic crash out of European exchange rate mechanism, the forerunner of the euro. In Woodford’s view, the UK economy is fundamentally healthy in 2018, with more people in work, more wage growth, less inflation, more investment spending and a continued recovery in manufacturing and exports. He is buying UK housebuilders, construction companies, retailers, leisure stocks and property. As for Brexit worries, he thinks they’re as overdone as the turn-of-the-century hysteria surrounding the “millennium bug”, when it was feared that computers couldn’t handle the transition from 1999 to 2000. ‘Look out for extremes of euphoria’: Jeremy Grantham Brace yourself for a stock market “melt-up”, said Jeremy Grantham this week – a startling prediction from a generally bearish investor, who is regarded as one of most insightful historians of financial bubbles. Grantham is the British-born veteran fund manager who in 1977 co-founded Boston-based GMO, which today manages $75bn (£55bn) of assets. The firm’s fame partly derives from its skill in having identified, and dodged, the last two big market blow-ups – the dotcom bubble of 1998-2000 and the US housing crisis that preceded the financial crash of 2007-09. His “melt-up” theory starts from the premise that, yes, markets – or, specifically, the US stock market – are highly priced. The data is “clean and factual”, he says. “We can be as certain as we ever get in stock market analysis that the current price is exceptionally high.” But there’s more to bubbles than just high prices, he argues. “Among other factors, indicators of extremes of euphoria seem much more important than price.” Grantham’s argument, in essence, is that signs of real frenzy – the wild excess that accompanies the late stage of bubbles – are only starting to fall into place now. “We know we’re not there yet, but we can perhaps see some early movement,” he says. Bitcoin, for example, is “a true, crazy mini-bubble of its own”. He defines a bubble as being “excellent fundamentals euphorically extrapolated”. In recent years, market fundamentals have been disappointing – share prices, in the old phrase, were “climbing the wall of worry”. Now, though, the fundamentals are improving, creating conditions for excess. President Trump’s corporate tax cuts are “very likely to further fatten the corporate share of the GDP pie and perhaps provide the oomph to keep stock prices rising”, Grantham says. There’s another, more technical, point: the rise in the US market (perhaps unlike the Brexit-influenced UK one) has been broadly based. In classic bubbles, the market tends to be led higher in its last stage by an increasingly small collection of “winners”, whose gains outweigh the majority of “losers”. That process hasn’t happened yet in the US. A word of warning. Grantham isn’t saying a “melt-up” phase is certain; he’s merely saying it is likely within the next six months to two years. And if “melt-up” happens, then prepare for meltdown: Grantham thinks there would be a 90% chance that the US market would fall 50% from its peak. CRAZY TIMES, CRAZY PRICES Salvator Mundi Leonardo da Vinci’s painting of Jesus Christ was sold at auction for $450m in November, about three times more than expected and way beyond the previous record. When Picasso’s Les Femmes d’Alger fetched $179m in 2015, the auctioneer who sold the cubist masterpiece predicted the figure would not be exceeded at auction for a decade. Bitcoin The cryptocurrency is a bigger speculative gamble than the Dutch tulip mania of the 1630s and the South Sea bubble of the 1720s, according to calculations by asset manager GMO. The Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman says of Bitcoin: “There’s been no demonstration yet that it actually is helpful in conducting economic transactions. There’s no anchor for its value.” Just Eat The fast-food delivery company joined the FTSE 100 index at the end of last year. It is worth £5.5bn, slightly more than Sainsbury’s, whose profits are about five times as great. Sovereign debt Argentina has defaulted on its debts eight times in the past 200 years, most recently in 2001. So who would want to buy a sovereign-backed bond that matures in 100 years’ time? Plenty of people, it seems. Argentina’s issue of $2.75bn of bonds last June was heavily oversubscribed.

It describes the idea that the US stock market, despite currently looking absurdly expensive by traditional yardsticks, could be set for one last euphoric hurrah before the inevitable crash happens. There are a couple of reasons why the “melt-up” theory may not be as wacky as it sounds. First, it comes from Jeremy Grantham, an investor who has rightly earned a reputation for knowing how to read financial bubbles. He dodged the end-of-the-century dotcom bubble and the 2007-09 blowup in the US housing market – two of the best calls anybody could have made in the past 20 years. Grantham’s default setting, as you would expect, tends to be bearish, or at least cautious. If he’s talking melt-up, that’s newsworthy. Besides, GMO, the Boston-based fund management group he founded, manages $75bn of assets – he’s a player. A second reason is that Grantham is certainly not arguing that shares are cheap. “We can be as certain as we ever get in stock market analysis that the current price is exceptionally high,” he states. Instead, his melt-up thinking is driven by a “mish-mash of statistical and psychological factors based on previous eras”. On the statistical side, he points out that the global economy is in sync, profit margins are fat and president Trump’s corporate tax cuts could make them even fatter and “perhaps provide the oomph to keep stock prices rising”. Then there’s the fact that the current strength in the stock market is fairly broad-based. In past bubbles, the end was nigh when gains were concentrated in an increasingly small collection of “winners”. The likes of Apple are roaring this time, but the same divergence has not occurred – yet. For “touchy-feely” evidence of excess about to appear, Grantham looks at media coverage. US newspapers and TV stations are getting interested in financial markets (with bitcoin, “a true, crazy mini-bubble of its own”, to the fore) but not yet with the wild obsession of the frenzied dotcom years. “Keep an eye on what the TVs at lunchtime eateries are showing,” he says. Grantham’s guess is that there is more than a 50% chance of a melt-up, or end-phase of the bubble, within the next six months to two years. If it happens, then there’s a 90% probability of a melt-down, which could mean a halving of share prices from the peak. A credible theory? Well, yes, anything is possible. A year ago, when the Dow Jones industrial average passed 20,000, few thought it would hit 25,000 within 12 months – but it happened on Thursday. Is that a case of extreme euphoria, or just early signs of it? Given the impossibility of knowing, Grantham’s advice to “brace yourself” sounds reasonable. Brace, and keep a clear eye on the exit. Debenhams Christmas tidings not as joyful as chief predicted Eight months ago the chief executive of Debenhams, Sergio Bucher was telling investors he would make the tired-looking department store group “a destination, digital and different”. He didn’t quite disavow discounting, but the tactic would be deployed less often and with more impact. Nice idea, shame about the results. Even before the completion of one lap of a three-year plan, Debenhams has coughed up a horrible profits warning that imperils shareholders’ dividends, even if nobody is saying so yet. Profits for the full year will arrive at £55m-£65m. Call that a plunge of a third from last year’s £95m. Debenhams’s Christmas grumbles sound familiar. The report was a long complaint about the “highly competitive” and “promotion-driven” state of the market, especially on “gifts”, which is shorthand for everything from booze to Christmas crackers. That won’t cut much ice with investors. The likes of B&amp;M, with its cheap’n’cheerful sheds, aren’t going away. One can’t, of course, judge a three-year revival plan on the basis of one bad Christmas. Equally, however, you can’t blame investors for taking a gloomy view – the shares plunged 15% and Debenhams is now worth just £370m. Five years ago, the business was making £139m of pre-tax profits and the downwards trend has been consistent. Borrowings are lower than they were in the bad old days of private equity ownership, as the company keeps saying, but the current “medium-term financial leverage target” is to reduce net debt to 0.5 times top-line operating profits. The new profits forecast may mean no progress whatsoever from last year’s 1.3 times. That is why a dividend costing £42m a year looks unsustainable – the theoretical (or imaginary) dividend yield of 11% says as much. Bucher came from Amazon, where they don’t have to worry about excess store space, long leaseholds or even shareholders’ dividend expectations. Good luck – this job looks much harder.",https://media.guim.co.uk/96a538b06381690553118767d571f6dc2e73ae83/0_174_3500_2101/500.jpg,0.06655416599861047

Britain’s stock market has closed at a new peak tonight, on the first trading day since Christmas. The FTSE 100 hit a record closing high, propelled by mining companies as optimism for the world economy in 2018 boosted commodity prices. The smaller FTSE 250 also finished at its highest ever level, partly due to a takeover bid for office manager IWG (which closed 27% higher). The rally came as new data showed that the world’s 500 richest people had collectively gained $1tn in 2017. But it was a volatile day for bitcoin. After surging 13% yesterday, the digital currency has fallen back this afternoon. It’s currently down 4% at $15,094 - having been valued at almost $20,000 10 days ago. This latest fluctuation came after Israel’s stock market regulator suggested it could ban cryptocurrency firms from listing on the Tel Aviv exchange. That’s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The jump in commodity prices today helped to push the FTSE 100 to its record high, thanks to the various mining giants that are included in the index. Sky News explains: The rally was supported by an upturn in copper and other commodity prices, which helped to lift global mining giants including Fresnillo, Antofagasta and Glencore. Demand for commodities implies optimism about the outlook for rapidly advancing world economies such as China. Greg McKenna, chief strategist at AxiTrader, said: “The rally in copper supports expectations that 2018 is going to be a strong year for synchronised global growth.” Of course, the FTSE 100’s run of record highs is less impressive once you remember the tumble in sterling 18 months ago. The pound is still worth around 10% less than before the EU referendum; that made UK companies more affordable to overseas investors, and pumped up the value of their foreign earnings. Peer and pollster Lord Ashcroft tweets: The smaller, more domestically focused FTSE 250 has also hit a new record high tonight: Newsflash: the FTSE 100 index has closed at a new all time high of 7,620 points. Mining companies and supermarkets helped the index rise on the first trading day since Christmas. Newsflash: US consumer confidence has fallen back from its recent highs. The Conference Board’s measure of consumer confidence, just released, dropped to 122.1 in December, down from November’s 129.5 - which was the highest in 17 years. Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, says: “The decline in confidence was fueled by a somewhat less optimistic outlook for business and job prospects in the coming months,” The wheels are coming off Bitcoin’s recovery. The crypocurrency is now down over 4% at $15,080, which means it has shed over $1,000 since this morning’s early bounce. Over in New York, the US stock market has opened very slightly higher as traders return to work after the Christmas break. The Dow Jones industrial average rose by 16 points, or 0.07%, with the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also managed minuscule gains. While mining companies drove the FTSE 100 to today’s record high, engineering firm Rolls-Royce, building materials group Ferguson, broadcaster Sky and holiday firm TUI all held it back: Newsflash: Britain’s FTSE 100 has just hit a new all-time high, following the lead set by its little brother, the FTSE 250. The index of the biggest companies listed in London has risen by 22 points, or 0.3%, to 7615 - nudging over the previous intraday record set last Friday. The jump in commodity prices today, such as copper, has pushed mining stocks up (silver miner Fresnillo is the top performer, up almost 3%), with other natural resource companies also up. This means the FTSE 100 has gained around 6.6% this year, lagging behind other indexes such as the US Dow Jones (+25%), Germany’s DAX (+13%) or the Hong Kong Hang Seng (+34%). Maybe it was the prospect of Mrs Brown’s Boys as the highlight of TV on Christmas Day - but according to official HMRC figures, a total of 2,590 people said ‘bah humbug’ to the festivities and decided to spend the day filling in and submitting their tax return instead. Even as millions of kids across the globe were transfixed by Santa trackers on their computers, in the last hour of Christmas Eve, 92 grown-ups were instead glued to the HMRC’s homepage and sent in their tax returns between 23.00 and midnight. On Boxing Day, a further 7,655 returns arrived at HMRC. HMRC issued the figures as it began its annual plea to the 11m people in Britain who must complete a self-assessment form by January 31. This year it has a new advertising campaign, featuring ducks, of course. The strapline is “Don’t let your tax returns peck away at you”. It’s quackers. Via City AM, here’s a list of the billionaires who gained the most wealth in 2017. The full table is online here. Meanwhile a new poll in Greece has revealed that most citizens are not buying the leftist-led government’s cheery vision of a ‘clean exit’ from international supervision when the country’s latest bailout programme officially ends next year. Helena Smith reports from Athens In theory, Greeks should be going into the new year on an optimistic note. After seven years of gruelling austerity – the price of three economic adjustment programmes that have kept the debt stricken country afloat – Athens’ latest bailout officially expires in August 2018. But the excoriating terms attached to financial rescue won’t end there, with the result that most Greeks are not buying government assertions of post-bailout bliss come the summer. Instead, a poll conducted on behalf of the Real News newspaper by MRB Hellas found that 66.3% of respondents are convinced that international monitoring of Greek finances will continue in some form. A mere 17% accept the official version: that Greece will make a ‘clean exit,’ weaning itself off borrowed funds by returning to international capital markets. Under that scenario – one vividly expanded by prime minister Alexis Tsipras – Athens will have completed a compliance review in time for the country to build up a cash buffer that would enable it to return to markets and begin debt relief talks by the summer. However, only one in four Greeks expect a market return. Three out of five don’t think Greece would be able to tap markets to cover debt payments, according to the survey. Boom! Britain’s FTSE 250 index, which contains medium-sized companies too small for the FTSE 100, has hit a new alltime high. The FTSE 250 has gained 59 points to 20,540 this morning, putting it ahead of the previous record high set on 22 December. Offices group International Workplace Group (IWG) is leading the rally; its shares have jumped by almost 30% today after receiving a takeover offer from Canada’s Onex and Brookfield Asset Management. The FTSE 100 is also close to a record high today, up 13 points at 7606. Other European markets are lagging, though, with Germany’s DAX down 0.3% and Spain’s IBEX down 0.2%. Henry Croft at Accendo Markets explains: Miners are leading the FTSE’s charge higher after Copper traded a fresh three and half year high on Christmas Day, however a significant contribution from Oilers, the index’s largest sector, is aiding the latest foray in record territory. Continued concern as to the impact of last week’s Catalonian election victory for pro-independence parties, as well as a Euro recovery from its Christmas Day ‘flash crash’, are both weighing on mainland European equities, while US futures are clawing back gains following a negative Boxing day session impacted by an Apple sell-off. Commodity price are charging ahead today (doubtless pleasing billionaires in the raw materials sector). The copper price has hit its highest level in over three years, partly due to optimism that the strengthening global economy will push up demand. The prospect of supply cuts was also a factor - with China ordering its top producer to halt output for a week to combat winter pollution. Metal prices are also rising because the US dollar has weakened (as traders ponder the consequences of Donald Trump’s tax ‘reform’ plan). Palladium has hit a 17-year high, at $1,069 per ounce, while gold rose to $1.285 per ounce. The world’s roster of billionaires includes Tyler and Cameron Winkelvoss, the internet entrepreneurs who made a big investment in bitcoin back in 2011. Their $11m investment is probably worth around $1.3bn today - although their precise fortune is obviously as volatile as bitcoin itself. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA predicts more wild price moves next year.... Bitcoin is going to continue to fascinate traders heading into the new year and while volatility by its own standards has been tame today, it’s likely to remain very active. Speculators appetite for Bitcoin has been tested in the run up to Christmas, with price having fallen from around $20,000 to not far from half that less than a week later, depending on the exchange. While prices have since rebounded back to around $15,000, it will be interesting to see whether we see the kind of wild gains that we’ve become accustomed to in the coming months, or whether the recent decline has shaken people’s confidence in the cryptocurrency. The world’s wealthiest people needn’t worry about their incomes being squeezed, though. New figures from Bloomberg show that the 500 richest people in the world saw their respective wealth expand by an astonishing 23% during 2017, from $4.4 trillion to over $5.3 trillion. Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com, had the best year - gaining over $34bn to become the world’s richest person at around $99.6bn, thanks to the surge in Amazon’s share price. The report also shows that lesser (!) billionaires also had a vintage year, as the strong gains on the world’s stock markets made the richest even richer (at a time when the average household in the UK was suffering from falling real wages) Here are some of the key points from Bloomberg’s report: The 38 Chinese billionaires on the Bloomberg index added $177 billion in 2017, a 65 percent gain that was the biggest of the 49 countries represented. Hui Ka Yan, founder of developer China Evergrande Group, added $25.9 billion, a 350 percent jump from last year, and the second-biggest U.S. dollar gain on the index, after Bezos. Technology billionaire Ma Huateng, co-founder of messaging service Tencent Holdings, became Asia’s second-richest person when his fortune nearly doubled to $41 billion. The number of Asian billionaires surpassed the U.S. for the first time, according to a UBS Group AG and PricewaterhouseCoopers report. The U.S. has the largest presence on the index, with 159 billionaires who added $315 billion, an 18 percent gain that gives them a collective net worth of $2 trillion. Russia’s 27 richest people put behind them the economic pain that followed President Vladimir Putin’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, adding $29 billion to $275 billion, surpassing the collective net worth they had before western economic sanctions began. It was also a banner year for tech moguls, with the 57 technology billionaires on the index adding $262 billion, a 35 percent increase that was the most of any sector on the ranking. Here’s the full story, which could fuel calls for higher wealth taxes to tackle the growing gap between the richest and everyone else. Hmmm, bitcoin’s rally seems to be fizzling out. The digital currency has now dipped back to around $15,500 - wiping out this morning’s gains. This sort of volatility is typical for bitcoin, but maybe the threat of a regulatory clampdown is worrying the market. FXTM’s Hussein Sayed says there are several reasons to be cautious: Israel became the most recent country to propose banning companies based on digital currencies to trade on its stock exchange. A South Korean bitcoin exchange has been hacked, leading it into bankruptcy. Cryptocurrency exchanges are disabling transaction temporarily due to high traffic. Professional traders on CBOE seems to be going short on Bitcoin. Britain should brace itself for another year of falling real wages. In news that might take the sparkle off your new year celebrations, the Resolution Foundation has predicted that pay rises won’t overtake inflation until the end of next year. If they’re right, that would mean the current cost of living squeeze will last two whole years. Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour’s Shadow Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Secretary, blames the government’s economic policies: “The Resolution Foundation report succinctly encapsulates the hardship many across Britain are facing under the Tories and will continue to face in 2018. “After seven years of Conservative economic mismanagement, the figures speak for themselves. Real wages are still lower than they were in 2010 and Britain faces a productivity crisis. “This is not a Government willing or able to raise productivity and living standards for people in Britain.” Tech companies are suffering a hangover this morning, following reports that sales of Apple’s new iPhone X have been disappointing. Yesterday Taiwan’s Economic Daily reported that Apple will slash its sales forecast for the iPhone X in the first quarter to 30 million units, down from 50 million. This hit Asian chip makers overnight, and European technology companies are now following - sending the Stoxx 600 tech index down 1%. Austrian-based Apple supplier AMS is the biggest casualty, down almost 10% We had been expecting new UK mortgage data today, but it turns out that the figures are actually being released by UK Finance (the industry body) tomorrow. As predicted, European stock markets are rather quiet after the Christmas break. In London, the FTSE 100 is up a modest four points (perhaps traders are being distracted by the snowflakes that are now sweeping through the capital). Mining companies are leading the risers; Rio Tinto, Glencore, BHP Billiton and Anglo American have all gained around 1.5% while silver producer Fresnillo is up 2%. Jeremy Cook of World First sums up the situation: Bitcoin’s stumble last week came after two exchanges, CME and Cboe, both launched futures markets allowing investors to bet against the cryptocurrency - as this tweet shows: Shares in cryptocurrency-related companies have also risen today, on the back of bitcoin’s rebound. Reuters has the details: Internet provider GMO Internet Inc, which is engaged in the “mining” of bitcoin, rose 3.1%. Remixpoint Inc, an operator of virtual currency trading post services, gained 5%. The bitcoin futures price has also rebounded from last week’s slump. On CME Group’s new bitcoin derivatives market, the price of a bitcoin in January has risen by $430 today to $16,250. The bitcoin futures prices allow traders to bet on bitcoin falling, or rising, in value. As things stand, bitcoin has gained around 1,600% during 2017, despite last week’s wobble. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, agrees that bitcoin looks like a bubble -- partly because it’s so hard to put a ‘proper’ value on it. He writes: After crashing by more than $8,000 from an all-time high, Bitcoin is up 3.5% at the time of writing. Although the recent plunge frightened many bitcoin fans, when looking at the relatively short history of bitcoin trading, the price action seems just normal. During 2017 the cryptocurrency crashed by 30% or more six times. Every fall was followed by huge price appreciation until it peaked on 17 December. Whether the Bitcoin bull market is close to an end or just pausing for a short break, remains to be a wild question for 2018. I still believe that Bitcoin is in a bubble formation. However, there’s no effective test to measure at which stage we are currently standing. For example, equity prices may be said in a bubble territory if investors are willing to pay much more for a stock than the intrinsic value which is justified by the discounted divided stream. Similarly, econometric tests may be run on bonds, commodities, currencies or any other asset to come up with a justified value. For Bitcoin, there isn’t any fundamental basis to justify the price. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There’s a subdued atmosphere in the City of London this morning as traders struggle through the drizzle back to their desks following the Christmas break. But bitcoin is defying the quiet mood, and staging a strong recovery after its sharp plunge last week which saw it fall from around $19,000 to just $14,000 in two days. The price of bitcoin surged by 13% on Tuesday, and it’s extending those gains again this morning - currently changing hands at around $16,200. That should relieve those who jumped into the cryptocurrency arena in recent weeks, but may also spur concerns that the bitcoin bubble is still inflating. The rally comes despite another crackdown against bitcoin, this time from Israel. On Monday, Israel’s stock market regulator revealed plans to ban companies based on digital currencies from trading on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Shmuel Hauser, the chairman of the Israel Securities Authority, declared that the public need to be protected from potentially unscrupulous bitcoin operations: “If we have a company that their main business is digital currencies we would not allow it. If already listed, its trading will be suspended.” Hauser, who clearly isn’t a fan of bitcoin, added: “I think it looks like a bubble, smells like a bubble, acts like a bubble and feels like a bubble. This tough stance may embolden other regulators to take a closer look at bitcoin, which could mean further volatility in the weeks ahead. Apart from bitcoin, City traders will also be watching out for new UK home loan data this morning, and US consumer confidence stats this afternoon (unless they slope off early to finish off the mince pies). The agenda: 9:30am GMT: UK mortgage approvals data for November 3pm GMT: US Consumer Confidence index for December Update: the mortgage approvals figures have been pushed back to Thursday.",https://media.guim.co.uk/b9b028c59eeb334ffd85eb2b528c0e8e3845e30f/91_0_3409_2046/500.jpg,0.10202481223856691
35,article,lifeandstyle/2017/sep/29/popcorn-boom-americas-favorite-snack,Food,2017-09-29,Popcorn boom points to 'third golden age' for America's favorite snack,https://gu.com/p/79av2,Lifestyle,Popcorn boom points to 'third golden age' for America's favorite snack,<p>Movies may bomb but with year-on-year sales up 16.9% popcorn – whether eaten at home or at the theater – is set to emulate its popularity in the 30s and 80s</p>,830,"Hollywood can bomb at the box office and television can shrivel to the size of a phone but one element of American movie-watching remains sacrosanct: popcorn. The seed first popped by Native Americans has sailed through upheaval in the entertainment industry and ever-shifting dietary trends to enter an apparent “third golden age” as America’s favourite snack. Sales of ready-to-eat popcorn and caramel corn rose 16.9% from February 2016 to February 2017, spurring innovation with popcorn chips, cakes and other spin-off products. Last week Disneyland launched a $15 glow-in-the-dark popcorn bucket based on Oogie Boogie, the villain in The Nightmare Before Christmas, which prompted hour-long queues at popcorn carts and a secondhand market on eBay. Popcorn sales peak in the fall, and October is officially “national popcorn poppin’ month”. The association with film, however, is year-round. “Popcorn is still the most popular item on the menu for moviegoers, along with soda,” said Patrick Corcoran, a spokesman for the National Association of Theater Owners. Some cinemas offer more elaborate fare such as gourmet brownies, vegan sandwiches and high-end coffee because people wanted to see but not necessarily consume them, said Corcoran. “One owner told me they didn’t really sell but that people liked the feeling they were there. The prime driver was still soda and popcorn.” When the Star Wars franchise rebooted, theater owners across the US “stocked up like crazy”, said Corcoran. “Bags and bags of it lining their corridors and into their offices.” Hollywood has just endured its worst summer box office in a decade so theatre popcorn sales have likely dipped – but consumption of the seed, a type of corn kernel which expands and pops when heated, is booming elsewhere thanks to the microwave, streaming television and trends towards wholegrain, gluten-free diets. “We still associate it with movies and good times,” said Wendy Boersema Rappel, of the Popcorn Board, a Chicago-based non-profit funded by US popcorn processors. “America has grown up with popcorn. It’s part of our history, part of who we are as Americans when it comes to having fun.” Americans consume 14bn quarts (13.2bn litres) of popped popcorn annually, or 43 quarts per man, woman and child, according to the Popcorn Board. Almost three-quarters is eaten at home, the rest in theaters, stadiums, schools and elsewhere. The 16.9% rise in sales of ready-to-eat popcorn translated into 160m pounds (72.5m kilos) sold, pushing annual revenue to $1.05bn, said David Walsh of Snac International, the snack industry’s trade organisation. “Ready-to-eat popcorn as a category is exploding due to its appeal as a premium snack, using healthier oils, unique salts and flavours and premium corn,” said Walsh. “Popcorn is seen as a better-for-you base capable of carrying a host of innovative flavours.” The Aztecs used corn as food and adornment for ceremonial headdresses, necklaces and on statues of deities. The industrial revolution and the advent of big sports events and movies popularised popcorn in the US, especially during the Depression, said Patrick Evans-Hylton, a chef and author of a book about popcorn. “Popcorn was really an affordable luxury. For five cents you could get a bag big enough to share with someone and escape your troubles for a while. That’s when the snack became part of the DNA of being American.” Sales in theatres fell in the 1950s when the spread of television hit cinema attendance. “The second golden age really began in early 1980s with microwaves. A renaissance born of convenience,” said Evans-Hylton. The spread of cable and streaming services like HBO and Netflix provided additional incentive whether watching on huge TVs or handheld devices. “More opportunity – or excuses – to eat it at home,” said Boersema Rappel. Health concerns have at times dented enthusiasm. A lung disease called bronchiolitis obliterans was nicknamed popcorn lung because of an association with diacetyl butter-like flavorings. Popcorn processors started phasing out diacetyl in 2007. The use of palm oil in movie theatre popcorn caused a separate outcry in the 1990s. Cinemas offered healthier options but in places that backfired. “Audiences hated it, all but rebelled, so [some theatres] went back to popcorn popped in oil,” said Corcoran, of the theatre owners’ association. Popcorn – at least that non-cinema popcorn – is now considered healthy because it is a non-GMO, gluten-free wholegrain naturally high in fibre and low in fat and calories – 30 calories a cup if air-popped. “We’re now in a third golden age because popcorn is seen as not only affordable and available but also a true, nutritious snack,” said Evans-Hylton. As a food writer who ate out all the time, his weight ballooned to more than 400lb. He slimmed down to less than 200lb thanks in part to popcorn. “I knew I could eat a handful and it would be OK.” Evans-Hylton combines it with olive oil, tartare sauce and parmesan, or for sweetness, chocolate shavings and cinnamon. America’s original snack should be savoured and celebrated, he said. “I don’t know I’d trust anyone who didn’t like popcorn. What’s wrong with you, buddy?”",https://media.guim.co.uk/2ebbfe4c1bff1c4f8fa0eccddcad0cdc2064ae84/0_0_4000_2400/500.jpg,0.11455373406193078

So how were the carp croquettes at the world’s first cultured fish tasting? Illustration: Jasper Rietman</p>",2951,"The broad avenues that lie south of Market Street in San Francisco are dotted with the headquarters of famous tech firms, from Uber and Airbnb to BitTorrent and Dropbox. Grand arts and civic buildings sit incongruously among office blocks, huddles of the city’s homeless and hip shared workspaces in which tech entrepreneurs and scientists plug away at their ideas to change the world. One such workspace houses Finless Foods, a company growing fish flesh in their laboratory, aiming to feed the 5,000 and then some without needing to kill a single animal. It was founded in 2016 by university buddies Mike Selden and Brian Wyrwas, bright-eyed biochemists in their mid-20s who are on a mission to save the oceans and bring affordable, contaminant-free fish to the masses. Finless Foods is the first firm to enter the race to take cellular agriculture – meat grown outside of animals – to market with marine, as opposed to land animals. In 2013, the godfather of what is also known as cultured or in-vitro meat, Professor Mark Post from Maastricht University, unveiled the first ever cultured beefburger - no livestock required. It was dry and anaemic, but, says Post, “it showed it could be done.” Three years later, San Francisco startup Memphis Meats delivered a succulent beef meatball, following up this year with fried chicken and duck a l’orange. Meanwhile, Hampton Creek foods (also in San Francisco) are boldly promising they will be selling cultured poultry as soon as the end of next year. Selden and Wyrwas’s lab was only established in March 2017, and as Selden says, “Fish cell culture was really not a thing. Human cell cultures - we do that all the time and there’s all sorts of papers on animal culture, but for fish, Brian had to invent a protocol to do that.” Yet by the end of our first conversation I am invited to taste their first prototype. “We’re small but we’re moving very quickly, and so are the investors,” says Selden, with the robotic urgency of someone who dedicates every waking hour to their vocation. He bristles at the phrases “Frankenmeat” and “lab-grown meat”, insisting that “they’re not fair or accurate”. He makes his point by comparing the process of culturing meat cells to another passion of his: brewing beer. That hallowed, ancient process tends to happen in giant, sterile, sealed fermenters, which are not unlike the bioreactors that will be used for culturing meat in industrial quantities. Trusty beer, he points out, “is often prototyped in a facility that looks like a laboratory: it’s white, everyone’s wearing lab coats and gloves, and is using lab equipment. So if we’re lab-grown meat, then beer is lab-grown beer. We’re not going to have armies of scientists sitting over petri dishes forever.” The technology for culturing animal cells was originally developed for medical use; in fact Post, whose early burger attempt was funded by Google co-founder Sergey Brin, had a background in repairing heart tissue. An early attempt by academics to culture fish (the results of which were published in 2002) tested the processes as a potential renewable protein source for astronauts embarking on a four-year schlep to Mars. Brin’s motivation to jumpstart the path to cultured meat was simple: “There are three things that can happen going forward. One is we will all become vegetarian – I don’t think that is really very likely. The second is we ignore the issues, and that leads to continued environmental harm. And the third option is we do something new.” Other high-profile investors include Kimbal Musk (brother of Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk), Bill Gates, Richard Branson and traditional meat and agriculture corporations such as Tyson Foods. A representative from Tyson, the world’s second largest processor of chicken, beef and pork, informed me by email that the move is “part of its overall strategy to invest in solutions to feed a growing world population”. The principle for culturing cells is relatively straightforward. Animal cells can be obtained harmlessly by biopsy from a living beast, or in the case of Finless, says Selden, “We have an agreement with the aquarium at the bay that whenever a fish dies, they call me and I jump in a car, pick up the fish, bring it back and Brian cultures it up.” By “culturing up” he means feeding the cells in a solution of salts, carbohydrates and proteins. “Typical division time for most animals is about 24 hours,” he says. Whether you’ve got two cells or two tonnes, you’ll have double a day later, although this may get faster. The greatest challenge lies in making the process affordable enough to scale-up production and be competitively priced. An alternative needs to be found for the animal serum – commonly foetal bovine serum – that’s currently used to kick-start cell division. “It’s about $500 a litre, and it’s totally against the mission of our company,” says Selden. “We’re trying to make food that doesn’t harm animals and it’s kind of doing the opposite. Also, animal serum is variable from batch to batch.” I visit Finless Foods’ lab ahead of the prototype tasting. They’re moving to new bespoke quarters later this year, but in the meantime share a workspace with various young companies developing biotech solutions to the world’s problems. We pass Clara Foods, which has created the world’s first animal-free egg, and a centrifuge whizzing around something to do with regenerating “the nipple-areolar complex” for women after mastectomies. Senior scientist at Finless, Jihyun Kim, proudly invites me to peer through her microscope at fish cells developing in a beaker of clear, pink liquid resembling the run-off from defrosting pork. A pattern has formed on the bottom of the beaker – the slightest sliver of fish. It doesn’t look appetising, but neither do the contents of an abattoir. Selden, Post and the other cultured meat startups exude confidence about solving the serum puzzle: with venture capitalists to keep sweet, and stiff competition, a certain swagger must be displayed at all times. The serum provides proteins called growth factors. “We’re trying to find which growth factors are most important for fish cell growth,” says Selden, “and we’re making those ourselves in-house.” They produce them in a similar way to how human insulin is made for people with diabetes. Up until 1978, medical insulin was extracted from ground pig or cow pancreases. These days we can genetically modify yeast or bacteria to produce human insulin. Similarly, the serum alternative will involve putting fish DNA inside yeasts, “which then act as little protein factories”. Selden assures GMO haters that this doesn’t mean the meat cells are GM, “but they used proteins produced by a GMO to signal them into dividing and growing.” At Finless Foods they say they’ll have a blue-fin tuna product ready for market in late 2019. Post is more conservative; he says he is happy with his product, but is at least three years from selling one. As well as working on his own serum alternative, he is seeking to replace the bovine collagen he uses “so the cells can find each other and form a fibre.” Hi-tech, plant-based protein alternatives, meanwhile, are starting to give meat a run for its money. Los Angeles-based Beyond Meat makes chicken strips largely from a protein in peas, and beefburgers that bleed beetroot juice. After Bill Gates tried a Beyond Chicken taco, he blogged about being fooled into thinking it was the real thing. Meanwhile the Impossible burger exploded out of Silicon Valley and is available in restaurants across the US. It is uncannily beef-like, oozing cholesterol-free fat and pink through the middle. Impossible’s not-so-secret ingredient is heme, a compound that is abundant in meat but can be sourced from plants. According to Impossible’s blurb, heme is what makes “meat sizzle, bleed and taste gloriously meaty.” But in the eyes of the cultured meat trailblazers, fancy vegetarian food will never have mass appeal. Demand for meat, and fish, is only going one way. “The question is, which product can satisfy the craving of the population for meat?” posits Post. “At the moment it’s there and it’s increasing ... culturing is going to cover the entire gamut of meats that are out there. It will be much more difficult to achieve that goal with vegetable-based proteins.” This is a sentiment the Chinese government has got behind, announcing a $300m investment in cultured meat produced in Israel. The US may be among the world’s most carnivorous nations, but as China’s economy swells, the planet’s most populous country is catching up. Hampton Creek is a little different. The company already produces a range of plant-based vegan foods. Their “Just” branded mayonnaise, dressings and cookies is delicious. As we perch on stools in the industrial open-plan, dog-friendly office and test kitchen, CEO Josh Tetrick tells me his life mission is to transform the food industry by testing the culinary properties of all plants. He has a storeroom housing endless shelves of white tubs of ground-seeds, and lab machines that use AI to “find plants as fast as we can that we can make better products from”. I taste a “scrambled egg” prototype made from a substance found in a variety of mung bean. It’s surprisingly good. So why isn’t he making plant-based meat alternatives? “I can’t imagine the people I was raised with in Birmingham Alabama under any scenario choosing a plant-based hamburger ... it’s an identity thing.” Tetrick is a controversial figure. He recently fired three top executives who he claimed were planning a coup and when we meet, he is plotting to control the cultured meat industry, buying up patents across the globe. He admits, however, that the road to public acceptance of cultured meat is paved with “gnarly problems, communication issues, regulatory issues.” When you tell people about growing animal muscle and fat cells in factories, the initial reaction is invariably revulsion. But after you point out the ethical and health benefits, they warm to the prospect. Cultured meat doesn’t involve intensively farming and slaughtering animals, nor the associated environmental and animal-cruelty costs, not to mention the risks of human contamination with disease, antibiotics, pesticides and – in the oceans – mercury and plastics. Fish farming, which accounts for over half of global fish consumption, increasingly relies on pesticides, fungicides and antibiotics, which pollute open water surrounding the captive fish. Aquaculture also employs inhumane methods to physically detach parasites from the fish. Farmed fish are not even immune to absorbing mercury and toxic industrial byproducts such as PCBs and dioxins, although being in shallower water reduces their exposure. This is why companies such as Hampton Creek and Memphis Meats are referring to their produce as “clean meat”, and it’s catching on: clean meat, clean conscience. However, research into public attitudes to cultured meat, published in January in the peer-reviewed journal Plos One, found that while politically liberal consumers were more receptive to the idea than conservatives, and while most respondents to their online survey were up for trying it, only a third were willing to eat it regularly in place of conventionally produced meat. The key consumer concerns were cost, flavour and it being unnatural. Naturalness is perhaps one of the most slippery concepts ever to have been massaged by advertising copywriters. As New Harvest, an organisation that funds cultured meat research, states on its website, “bread, cheese, yogurt and wine are unnatural. All involve processing ingredients derived from natural sources.” No one can argue that intensive farming is natural. Eating insects is arguably more natural, and yet westerners turn their noses up at the idea. Meat without consciousness is a far more philosophically befuddling concept. Post says that 16 people have tasted his product, “and all agree that it’s meat”. However, Arnout Fischer, associate professor of consumer behaviour at Wageningen University in the Netherlands has found that “in the minds of many people, cultured meat is currently somewhere in a ‘grey border zone’ between being perceived as meat or not meat. In several of our studies it was shown that people associate it with some properties of meat, but also with some properties of meat replacers – ie vegetarian burgers etc.” Without a brain, cultured meat can indeed be thought of as almost plantlike. “If you look under a microscope, you see the same cell structures as you would meat from an animal,” says Koert Van Mensvoort, director of the Next Nature Network, a non-profit organisation in Amsterdam that investigates how technology transforms our relationship with nature. “But there’s a different story there that forces us to reevaluate our positions.” Which is partly why he thinks the new culinary possibilities created by cultured meat should be explored, rather than seeing it as replacing the sausages and burgers we’re so familiar with. “Meat sashimi, for instance – growing the meat in very controlled circumstances, you could make sushi or sashimi softer and better than the best sushi you have tasted.” Knitted steak, made from long strands of cultured meat, is another recipe in his In Vitro Meat Cookbook. “Why not look into high-protein, exquisite, slightly weird, extraordinary dishes?” he says. Acting as “a radar for potential futures,” he posits that we could one day culture-up our own cells for meat. Lovely pink beakers of human flesh. He surely can’t mean ethical cannibalism? “You could say it’s an intimate dish for a loved one – you give your body to your lover.” It’s a niche idea, he admits. “Most people I speak to say this is horror, they don’t see the poetry in it just yet.” People are already coming around to the idea of produce grown in factories rather than fields. Marks and Spencer has introduced microherbs cultivated free from pesticides in air-raid shelters, 33 metres below Clapham High Street in south London. And perhaps knowing that cultured meat isn’t a new idea might help normalise it. Winston Churchill was banging on about it in 1932. “We shall escape the absurdity of growing a whole chicken in order to eat the breast or wing, by growing these parts separately under a suitable medium,’’ he wrote, presciently. How a clean-meat revolution could affect the landscape and environment is riddled with ifs and buts, not helped by the secrecy among the startups. Hanna Tuomisto, a specialist in the environmental impacts of food production at the University of Helsinki, started investigating the implications at Oxford University in 2008. Feeding the cells is one thing, but to convert a mush of them into muscle-like structures adds a second layer of energy burn, and she can only guess at the expenditure involved. “When we estimate energy consumption,” she says, “it’s at the same level as beef or higher now, but there is lots of uncertainty in bioreactor design and the scales we are looking at now are quite small.” Culturing fish cells will probably use less energy than land animal cells, because fish cells will merrily reproduce at room temperature. However, if the land freed up by moving from intensive farming to cultured meat was used to grow bioenergy crops (a big if), this could mitigate the carbon generated by culturing. Post, meanwhile, thinks enterprising farmers might switch to crops that could provide the nutrients for cultured meat factories. Either way, converting the grassland we use for grazing would have serious drawbacks. Grassland has higher biodiversity than arable land, and converting grassland to arable land would release, Tuomisto says, “a lot of carbon from the soil.” When it comes to the craggy grasslands, especially highlands, that aren’t suitable for arable use, nobody’s in doubt that there will still be demand for free-range animal meat. “There will likely always be a role for family farms to play in feeding the planet,” says Memphis Meats CEO, Uma Valeti, “and we have no problem with that – in fact, my co-founder used to be a family farmer. But family farms can only produce a tiny fraction of the world’s demand for meat.” We do, of course, rely on animals for more than their meat. Brooklyn-based Modern Meadow is already on the case with culturing leather, but alternatives for all animal products need consideration. The world’s first cultured fish tasting takes place on an afternoon in early September, as the mist rolls over San Francisco from the bay. Silicon Valley chef Laurine Wickett will be preparing the fish at her gleaming catering kitchens. Before she fries the five bite-sized, cultured-carp croquettes she has made, she describes the raw paste of harvested cells within them as having a delicate flavour of the sea, a little like the water in an oyster shell. As I suppress thoughts of beakers of pink liquid and taste my perfectly-cooked croquette, I find it both delicious and disappointing. It’s only 25% fish and the subtle carp flavour is eclipsed by the potato. I just about detect a pleasant aftertaste of the sea, though not fish as such. But then, far from a polished product from a development kitchen, this is a first prototype – a benchmark of scientific progress. Selden and Wyrwas only tasted their fish for the first time a few days before. Despite the stingy fish-to-potato ratio, each tiny croquette had cost $200 (£150), working out at about $19,000 (£14,380)-per-pound of fish. But such is the speed of technological advance that they’ve already slashed that by more than half. Afterwards, Selden and Wywras are flushed with the raw elation of having given birth to something important, and they talk frenetically about strategies for developing a more mature fishy flavour, expansion into fresh premises and the structural wonders their newly recruited tissue engineer will create.

37,article,world/2017/aug/23/gmo-salmon-sales-unclear-where-to-buy-canada,World news,2017-08-23,The billionaire behind the world’s first genetically modified salmon,https://gu.com/p/72cya,News,The billionaire behind the world’s first genetically modified salmon,"<p>Intrexon, a $2.2bn company headed by Randal Kirk, quietly began selling transgenic salmon, after making apples that don’t brown and cloning pets</p>",1266,"If you want to sample the world’s first animal to be genetically engineered in the name of dinner, good luck finding it. If, on the other hand, you would never eat such a thing – good luck avoiding it. Tons of lab-developed salmon was sold in Canada last year without any packaging labeling it as a product of science, and the company that created and raises the fish, AquaBounty, won’t release the names of food distributors it sells to. Giant restaurant supply companies, such as Sysco, deny ever having carried the product. Grocery store chains far and wide – including Costco, Sobeys and Loblaws – say they have not, and will not, stock it. Restaurants Canada, the industry group for the country’s food service industry, says it has not heard any chatter about the fish. At least five of the 121,000 tons of salmon farmed in Canada last year was genetically modified, engineered to grow faster and with less food. To shoppers – given no prior warning or labelling information – the product would be impossible to distinguish from regular salmon. Labeling for genetically modified foods is not required by law in the US or Canada. But where, exactly, did the company sell it? “We do not disclose the names of our customers, but they have been very positive about our product, stating that it was very high quality in terms of appearance, texture and taste,” said a company spokesman, Dave Conley. AquaBounty Technologies, which created the first genetically modified fish in the world, announced this year that it had sold five tons of transgenic salmon in Canada – last year. The company made no announcement when it started stocking store shelves with the fish, a decision that has come under fire. “For all the time and investment that went into the world’s first genetically modified food animal, there was no public notice, there was no announcement about this market breakthrough,” said Lucy Sharratt, coordinator of the Canadian Biotechnology Network. “The genetically modified salmon was put on the Canadian market under a cloak of secrecy where Canadians did not even know it was on the market,” she said. Sharratt herself only found out about the sale of transgenic salmon after reading a news story. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) sold as food are labeled in 64 countries, and surveys have shown that Canadians and Americans also want GMOs – and particularly transgenic animals – to be labeled. Supporters of the technology argue it could increase plant and animal productivity, and stave off hunger as the human population grows and climate change becomes more severe. Repeated literature reviews have not found harm to human health from plants that have already entered the food supply. However, because any gene from the biosphere can be used to produce a genetic modification, the nutritional value of foods could change, as could the behavioral traits of engineered animals. A recent report found plants designed to be herbicide resistant are fueling the use of glyphosate, the weed killer found in Monsanto’s Roundup that has been linked to cancer. Critics also argue that surveillance of GMO’s effects has been lax and made more difficult without labeling. The world’s first genetically modified fish farm is a subsidiary of Intrexon, a $2.2bn company headed by Randal Kirk, a self-made billionaire. Kirk, who claims he taught himself to read when he was three years old and is an avid falconer, believes Intrexon has a chance to become “one of the great companies of the world”. “These are products of technology, not government decisions or social policy making,” said Kirk at the 2016 World Food Prize event. The meeting is sponsored by the world’s largest agribusiness companies, such as Monsanto and Archer Daniels Midland. Kirk called “technophobia” his company’s “chief impediment”. “The debate – supposed debate, the faux debate, if you will – around the adoption of technology frequently takes odd paths. One will receive questions like, ‘Uh, GMO, gee, how do you feel about the ethics of that?’” he said, posing a mock question. “Ethics – I’m sorry, I did study ethics. “The idea of simply masking fear by calling it ethics is absurd,” he said. Intrexon declined to comment on this story. In addition to AquaBounty, Kirk’s companies make apples that don’t brown (Arctic apples); mosquitoes designed to die (through its subsidiary Oxitec); and clones of pets or livestock (Viagen). The organization is working on peaches resistant to plum pox, fast-growing tilapia and a cure for cancer. At the World Food Prize event, Kirk went on to describe how Intrexon had “fixed the main problem of the apple”. The company altered an enzyme that breaks down the apples once they are cut – nature’s way of releasing seeds into the environment. “People don’t really want whole apples – they want pre-sliced apples,” Kirk told the crowd. “This may actually be and become the most preferred GMO food, at least to date. It’s almost impossible to find someone who has tried it who doesn’t love it.” Intrexon is no stranger to controversy. Near Key West, Florida, last year, Oxitec aggressively pursued an experiment that would have released genetically modified mosquitoes into the environment. The male bugs are designed to breed with wild female mosquitoes and produce offspring that never reach maturity. The public opposed the experiment, especially in the community where it was supposed to take place; 65% voted against it in a referendum. “Opening this Pandora’s box – sometimes you don’t see the impact until five, 10, 15 years down the road,” Keys real estate agent and activist Mila De Mier told the Guardian last year, at the height of debate. “I’m not against genetically modified at all,” she said. “Sometimes, I don’t know what I put on my table, but that’s the difference – it’s about choice,” she said. “Permission has not been asked or given… This is only for Oxitec’s benefit.” Whether Kirk’s salmon business is viable, however, remains to be seen. AquaBounty appears to be losing money. The company earned only $53,000 through its salmon sales, according to public reports. It lost $2.1m the same year. Intrexon’s stock price has lost most of its value since a record high in July 2015, dropping from $64 per share to around $18 at the time of publication. Public opinion in North America is decidedly in favor of labeling genetically modified foods. A 2014 Consumer Reports poll found an astounding 92% of Americans in favor of labeling genetically modified salmon. Sharratt described Intrexon’s work as “part of changing our idea of what food is”. “That apples now come in plastic bags in slices, or fish are genetically modified and grown in farms,” she said. “Do we need non-browning apples, genetically engineered, when we already have naturally non-browning varieties of apples, and we have one of nature’s most perfect fruits without it being packaged in a plastic bag?” Nevertheless, Kirk’s bet could pay off. The CEO has rightly identified the salmon market as enormous. The US imported $3bn worth of salmon in 2016, or roughly 339,000 tons of fresh and frozen fish. Aquaculture, or fish farming, as an industry has grown at a steady 5.8% clip worldwide since 2005, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. The business is currently dominated by countries such as China and Vietnam. In part of Kirk’s World Food Prize speech, he argued consumers did not need to understand the mechanics of a technology before adopting it, using the public’s willingness to use the smartphone as an example. “I think our society is definitely setting a record,” said Kirk. “There’s never been another generation of man who has been so dependent on technology we don’t understand.”",https://media.guim.co.uk/7ec4a27be99bb9733ae6e4bf3616f4aa489bf85b/0_241_3888_2332/500.jpg,0.08564381631440456

The workers died in the overcrowded and poorly constructed building while working to meet our demands for fast fashion. Across the world conscious consumers will join fashionrevolution.org – a vibrant global civil movement focused on cleaning up the $3trn fashion industry, based primarily in low-wage economies. Post Rana Plaza there are many reform programmes under way, from the installation of fire escapes in supplier factories to the publication of factory lists by transnational brands. Understandably, consumers want to know which is the cleanest brand. Campaign groups aggregate these complex initiatives and publish transparency league ratings of brands to try to help us navigate the high street. There’s even an app, Not My Style, on iTunes. But as a recent study from New York University’s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights concludes, too much emphasis is put on transparency (self-declared by brands) rather than actual outcomes. The result? When it comes to paying a living wage, mainstream brands have made no real progress. To end poverty wages and unacceptable conditions for the 60-75 million people who work in the global garment supply chain, we need to stop letting billion dollar brands define our activism. The time is right. Take inspiration from climate-change activists: in 2015, 800 Dutch citizens used human rights law to prosecute the government for failing to cut climate-change emissions sufficiently. And guess what? They won! The big picture: sculpting the truth This 2.5 tonne ocean plastic sculpture, Plasticide, has been created by underwater sculptor Jason deCaires Taylor. It’s a dramatic installation that features seabirds regurgitating rubbish amid an idyllic family beach scene. It does not sugar-coat the issue. It’s estimated that as much as 12.7m tonnes of plastic packaging enter the sea every year. It was recently installed on the doorstep of Coca-Cola’s London HQ by Greenpeace in protest at the company’s role in ocean plastic pollution.

What began as a small Facebook group in the US capital, Washington DC has spiralled into a global phenomenon that will now see marches and other events in more than 500 locations around the world, from Seattle to Seoul. It is great news that so many people are prepared to stand up and defend the need for evidence-based thinking and the scientific method. But it is also a sad comment on our times that a March for Science is needed at all. Post-truth populism has infected democracies around the world, scientific objectivity is under threat from multiple sources and there seems a real danger of falling into a modern dystopian dark age. It is clear that the old days of scientists staying in the lab, publishing papers in scholarly journals, and otherwise letting the facts speak for themselves are over. As the Harvard science historian Naomi Oreskes reminds us: “The facts don’t speak for themselves because we live in a world where so many people are trying to silence facts.” In her book, Merchants of Doubt, Oreskes wrote about these efforts from the tobacco industry onwards; science denialist attempts that are paralleled in today’s climate sceptic, anti-vaccine and anti-GMO movements. These campaigners against truth take great pains to deny the existence of scientific consensus on their different issues. The fact that 97% of the peer-reviewed literature on climate change supports the consensus that most of global warming is human-induced is dismissed as mere elitism. But as Dr Sarah Evanega, director of the Alliance for Science at Cornell, writes: “The values we defend are those of the Enlightenment, not the establishment.” Expertise is real, and we reject it at our peril. Perhaps the most inspiring aspect of the March for Science, and what may prove to be its most enduring legacy, is its truly global nature. Science is not western; it is everywhere and for everyone. I have worked with Alliance for Science colleagues to help get marches off the ground in Bangladesh, Nigeria, Uganda, Venezuela, Chile and other places. In between long Skype calls about logistics, fundraising, and media outreach I watched the lights flash on as the number of marches on the global map kept on increasing. It was like watching the world light up with knowledge. Bangladesh March for Science’s lead organiser Arif Hossain says: “I am marching to let the world know that we are united for science in Bangladesh. We have 160 million people to feed in the changed climate, and together we will make a better day with science and innovation.” Although the issues of most concern vary in different locations, appreciation of the need for science is global. As Nkechi Isaac, an organiser of the March for Science in Abuja, Nigeria, says: “Science is revolutionary.

Science holds the solution to our food security.” Nigerians can testify to the tragic effects of anti-science activism. Efforts to eradicate polio in the country were held up for years because of conspiracy theories spread by those suspicious of modern medicine and vaccines. People die when science is denied.

Brexit came as a shock, as did the victory of Donald Trump. Much head-scratching has resulted as leaders seek to work out why large chunks of their electorates are so cross. The answer seems pretty simple. Populism is the result of economic failure. The 10 years since the financial crisis have shown that the system of economic governance which has held sway for the past four decades is broken. Some call this approach neoliberalism. Perhaps a better description would be unpopulism. Unpopulism meant tilting the balance of power in the workplace in favour of management and treating people like wage slaves. Unpopulism was rigged to ensure that the fruits of growth went to the few not to the many. Unpopulism decreed that those responsible for the global financial crisis got away with it while those who were innocent bore the brunt of austerity. Anybody seeking to understand why Trump won the US presidential election should take a look at what has been happening to the division of the economic spoils. The share of national income that went to the bottom 90% of the population held steady at around 66% from 1950 to 1980. It then began a steep decline, falling to just over 50% when the financial crisis broke in 2007. Similarly, it is no longer the case that everybody benefits when the US economy is doing well. During the business cycle upswing between 1961 and 1969, the bottom 90% of Americans took 67% of the income gains. During the Reagan expansion two decades later they took 20%. During the Greenspan housing bubble of 2001 to 2007, they got just two cents in every extra dollar of national income generated while the richest 10% took the rest. The US economist Thomas Palley* says that up until the late 1970s countries operated a virtuous circle growth model in which wages were the engine of demand growth. “Productivity growth drove wage growth which fueled demand growth. That promoted full employment, which provided the incentive to invest, which drove further productivity growth,” he says. Unpopulism was touted as the antidote to the supposedly failed policies of the postwar era. It promised higher growth rates, higher investment rates, higher productivity rates and a trickle down of income from rich to poor. It has delivered none of these things. James Montier and Philip Pilkington, of the global investment firm GMO, say that the system which arose in the 1970s was characterised by four significant economic policies: the abandonment of full employment and its replacement with inflation targeting; an increase in the globalisation of the flows of people, capital and trade; a focus on shareholder maximisation rather than reinvestment and growth; and the pursuit of flexible labour markets and the disruption of trade unions and workers’ organisations. To take just the last of these four pillars, the idea was that trade unions and minimum wages were impediments to an efficient labour market. Collective bargaining and statutory pay floors would result in workers being paid more than the market rate, with the result that unemployment would inevitably rise. Unpopulism decreed that the real value of the US minimum wage should be eroded. But unemployment is higher than it was when the minimum wage was worth more. Nor is there any correlation between trade union membership and unemployment. If anything, international comparisons suggest that those countries with higher trade union density have lower jobless rates. The countries that have higher minimum wages do not have higher unemployment rates. “Labour market flexibility may sound appealing, but it is based on a theory that runs completely counter to all the evidence we have,” Montier and Pilkington note. “The alternative theory suggests that labour market flexibility is by no means desirable as it results in an economy with a bias to stagnate that can only maintain high rates of employment and economic growth through debt-fuelled bubbles that inevitably blow up, leading to the economy tipping back into stagnation.” This quest for ever-greater labour market flexibility has had some unexpected consequences. The bill in the UK for tax credits spiralled quickly once firms realised they could pay poverty wages and let the state pick up the bill. Access to a global pool of low-cost labour meant there was less of an incentive to invest in productivity-enhancing equipment. The abysmally low levels of productivity growth since the crisis have encouraged the belief that this is a recent phenomenon, but as Andy Haldane, the Bank of England’s chief economist, noted last week, the trend started in most advanced countries in the 1970s. “Certainly, the productivity puzzle is not something which has emerged since the global financial crisis, though it seems to have amplified pre-existing trends,” Haldane said. Bolshie trade unions certainly can’t be blamed for Britain’s lost productivity decade. The orthodox view in the 1970s was that attempts to make the UK more efficient were being thwarted by shop stewards who modeled themselves on Fred Kite, the character played by Peter Sellers in I’m All Right Jack. Haldane puts the blame elsewhere: on poor management, which has left the UK with a big gap between frontier firms and a long tail of laggards. “Firms which export have systematically higher levels of productivity than domestically oriented firms, on average by around a third. The same is true, even more dramatically, for foreign-owned firms. Their average productivity is twice that of domestically oriented firms.” Populism is seen as irrational and reprehensible. It is neither. It seems entirely rational for the bottom 90% of the US population to question why they are getting only 2% of income gains. It hardly seems strange that workers in Britain should complain at the weakest decade for real wage growth since the Napoleonic wars. It has also become clear that ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing are merely sticking-plaster solutions. Populism stems from a sense that the economic system is not working, which it clearly isn’t. In any other walk of life, a failed experiment results in change. Drugs that are supposed to provide miracle cures but are proved not to work are quickly abandoned. Businesses that insist on continuing to produce goods that consumers don’t like go bust. That’s how progress happens. The good news is that the casting around for new ideas has begun. Trump has advocated protectionism. Theresa May is consulting on an industrial strategy. Montier and Pilkington suggest a commitment to full employment, job guarantees, reindustrialisation and a stronger role for trade unions. The bad news is that time is running short. More and more people are noticing that the emperor has no clothes. Even if the polls are right this time and Marine Le Pen fails to win the French presidency, a full-scale political revolt is only another deep recession away. And that’s easy enough to envisage. *Who Runs the Economy?; Palgrave Macmillan; edited by Robert Skidelsky and Nan Craig",https://media.guim.co.uk/7cf3a51f5b1ccfbaa1a0aefec6c54e346cc0813f/0_0_3500_2101/500.jpg,0.09714574314574313
41,article,business/2017/mar/07/the-north-face-patagonia-saving-world-one-puffer-jacket-at-a-time,Business,2017-03-07,Patagonia and The North Face: saving the world – one puffer jacket at a time,https://gu.com/p/63te9,News,Patagonia and The North Face: saving the world – one puffer jacket at a time,<p>The retail giants are not only competing to sell outdoor gear – they are rivals in the contest to sell the thrill of the wilderness to the urban masses</p>,5771,"On the night of his 30th birthday, after a few drinks, Dean Karnazes decided that he would celebrate by running all the way from San Francisco down the coast to the town of Half Moon Bay, a distance of 30 miles. So began a career as an endurance runner. He has run 50 marathons in 50 consecutive days in all 50 states, and taken part in such extreme competitions as a marathon to the South Pole and a 135-mile race through Death Valley, one of the hottest places on Earth. Karnazes once ran 350 miles in 81 hours and 44 minutes, without stopping to sleep. His account of his feats of distance running, Ultramarathon Man, is a bestseller. Karnazes’s superhuman exertions are sponsored by The North Face, the company that make the kit he wears in his coaching videos. The North Face, a Bay Area-based outdoor clothing manufacturer, sells garments and gear for climbing, backpacking, running, and skiing. Its stores are decorated with huge photographs of people climbing icy peaks and running through meadows. Central to the brand’s ethos are the professional athletes it sponsors, people not widely known but celebrated in their fields – names such as Karnazes and Pete Athans, who has climbed Everest seven times. The North Face sells the idea of adventure – of pushing limits – whether running long distances, climbing an untried rockface, or sleeping outside at sub-zero temperatures. Its tagline is “never stop exploring”. (“We have actually been approached with partnerships about spacesuits to Mars and things like that,” one publicist told me recently.) This canny marketing of adventure has made The North Face the dominant player in a booming outdoor-wear market – a $4bn industry in the US alone. And its closest rival in the contest to sell the thrill of the wilderness to the masses may be a company whose origins and history are tightly intertwined with its own: Patagonia. If The North Face aims to appeal to the overachieving weekend warrior, Patagonia is for the slightly more mellow soul who wants to soak up the fresh air and enjoy the view as he ascends a craggy mountain. The company’s ethos is encapsulated in Let My People Go Surfing, the memoir-cum-management classic about Patagonia, by the company’s founder Yvon Chouinard – reissued last year in a 10th-anniversary edition, with a new introduction by Naomi Klein. The book contains lavish colour pictures of people in genial communion with nature. To browse the book is to dive into a world of life-affirming outdoor feats followed by nights around the fire, swapping heroic tales. Unlike other billion-dollar sports brands, neither company sells balls or bats. They do not cater to team sports. They are, above all, selling the allure of the great outdoors, offering their customers technically advanced gear for going off into the wilds with a friend or two. (Or, if you prefer, alone: the cover of the winter 2016 Patagonia catalogue features a man on a motorbike – carrying a pair of skis under one arm – smiling at a squirrel as it crosses the road.) Both companies understand that the appeal of endurance sports has something to do with acquiring kit that boasts the most advanced technology. For genuine adventure, their marketing implies, you need top-quality gear. And top-quality gear designed to withstand the harshest conditions and last a lifetime does not come cheap. You can buy an Inferno sleeping bag from The North Face that will, for $729 (£593), keep you warm in temperatures as cold as -40C. For $529 (£430), you can get a neoprene-free, natural rubber, hooded wetsuit from Patagonia for use in water temperatures down to 0C. Both companies also understand that the largest market for their products is not explorers stocking up for Arctic expeditions. The real money comes from selling products designed for hardcore outdoor adventure to urban customers who lead relatively unadventurous lives. For the most part, people wear North Face and Patagonia gear while doing everyday things: cycling, shopping, walking the dog. “You can take a backpack to school but you feel like you’re in Yosemite just because it says North Face,” Dean Karnazes told me one afternoon in San Francisco. “I think that aspirational element is really big.” It’s a sales pitch that has yielded big profits. The North Face reported annual revenue of $2.3bn last year, with 200 stores around the world. Patagonia is smaller, but growing more rapidly. The company had sales of $800m in 2016, twice as much as in 2010, and has 29 standalone stores in the US, 23 in Japan, and others in locations such as Chamonix, the French ski resort. While The North Face sells $5,500 (£4,480) two-metre tents and Patagonia sells $629 waders for fly fishing, many of the most popular products for both companies are everyday wear: waterproof anoraks, leggings, fleeces, and, most important of all, puffer jackets. “Everyone is trying to reinvent and reinterpret the black puffy jacket,” said Jeff Crook, the chief product officer at Mountain Equipment Co-Op, an outdoor department store that has 20 stores across Canada, “whether it spends most of its time on the mountain peak or at the bus stop.” The flagship jackets for both companies are the product of decades of technological refinement to make them increasingly warm, durable, and light. The most advanced models today have been engineered to solve the problem of how to insulate the wearer against cold and wet while remaining “breathable” – so you don’t overheat while you’re scaling that cliff face. At Patagonia, there is the Nano-Air ($249; £180 in the UK), a quilted, but not very puffy, water resistant jacket that uses a trademarked synthetic insulation that the company described as “revolutionary” upon its release in 2014. The North Face Thermoball ($199; £150) has its own proprietary synthetic insulation, which uses clusters of fibre to trap heat in a manner that mimics down. Both jackets are fit for a mountaineering expedition, but are each more likely to be bought to keep warm while taking the kids to the park. Neither company regards the other as a rival – at least not publicly. But aside from the fact they sell the same kind of stuff to the same kind of customers (urban, affluent), the two companies have quite a bit of shared history. Doug Tompkins, co-founder of The North Face, and Yvon Chouinard were lifelong friends and brothers in adventure. Both men started out making their own specialist equipment; both went on to found companies selling outdoor wear; both felt distinctly uncomfortable doing office jobs, and still more uncomfortable running companies. “I’ve been a businessman for almost 60 years,” Chouinard writes in the introduction to Let My People Go Surfing. “It’s as difficult for me to say those words as it is for someone to admit being an alcoholic or lawyer.” And together, while promoting the glories of exploring the unspoiled wilderness, both men have been central to the mass popularisation of outdoor activities such as hiking and climbing, which may, in turn, make nature a little less unspoiled. Selling professional-grade gear to people with no intention of using it professionally isn’t exactly a new trick in marketing, as the makers of SUVs, digital cameras and headphones can tell you. Most people who buy the Nike trainers advertised by Mo Farah don’t use them to run long distances. But North Face and Patagonia are both wrestling with a more consequential paradox, one that is central to contemporary consumerism: we want to feel morally good about the things we buy. And both companies have been phenomenally successful because they have crafted an image that is about more than just being ethical and environmentally friendly, but about nature, adventure, exploration – ideas more grandiose than simply selling you a jacket, taking your money and trying not to harm the earth too much along the way. But the paradox is that by presenting themselves this way, they are selling a lot more jackets. In other words, both companies are selling stuff in part by looking like they’re not trying too hard to sell stuff, which helps them sell more stuff – and fills the world with more and more stuff. You might call this the authenticity problem. And for all their similarities, the two companies are taking radically different approaches to solving it. * * * Doug Tompkins and Yvon Choiunard were the kind of outcast adolescents who found a home in the great outdoors. Both men became passionate about climbing and surfing in the American west in the middle of the last century. Back in the 1950s and 60s, climbing was “an unusual sport with just a small group of renegades who were, you know, misfits”, said Rick Ridgeway, an accomplished mountaineer and adventurer. (Rolling Stone magazine once called him “The Real Indiana Jones.”) An old friend of both Tompkins and Choiunard, he is now vice president for public engagement at Patagonia. Both The North Face and Patagonia have their roots in exploring the sort of remote places about which guidebooks had not been written. In those days, getting back to uncorrupted nature and reading Thoreau by the campfire slotted in well with the nascent counterculture. “We took special pride in the fact that climbing rocks and icefalls had no economic value in society,” Chouinard wrote in Let My People Go Surfing. Tompkins opened the first The North Face retail store selling mountaineering equipment in the North Beach neighbourhood of San Francisco in 1966. The Grateful Dead played at the opening, and there was a fashion show featuring Joan Baez and her sister, the late singer and activist Mimi Fariña. In Southern California, Chouinard, who was among the pioneers of what has since become known as the “golden age of Yosemite climbing”, had begun making his own equipment in the late 1950s. At first, he created and forged reusable steel pitons that were hammered into rock faces and then removed. Then, to help preserve climbing routes from disfigurement, Chouinard changed to aluminium chocks that could be wedged in by hand and did not leave a trace behind. The ambition at the time was to do as little damage as possible – as the Sierra climber Doug Robinson put it: “Organic climbing for the natural man.” The two men met in the mid-60s when Tompkins began to distribute Chouinard’s equipment through The North Face. Early in their friendship, a white-water kayaking trip together in California ended with Chouinard getting 15 stitches in his face. And in 1968 the two drove a Ford Econoline van from Ventura, California, to the remote region of Chile and Argentina named Patagonia. That same year, Tompkins sold his stake in The North Face for $50,000, and with his then wife, Susie, founded the San Francisco-based casualwear brand Esprit, whose hip version of sportswear became synonymous with 1980s style. After reading Bill Devall’s environmental call to arms Deep Ecology: Living as if Nature Mattered in the 1980s, Tompkins decided to leave the apparel business and devote himself full time to saving the environment. By the time Esprit was sold in 1990, its annual sales were estimated to be $1bn. Chouinard had also branched out from mountaineering equipment. He had begun to import climbing wear, for sale, and in 1973, founded a new company named Patagonia. One of his earliest employees was Kris McDivitt, a downhill ski-racer. She became general manager and then CEO of Patagonia, before she met Doug Tompkins, who was then divorced.They married in 1993, a union of sorts between the two companies. Together the couple eventually bought 2.2m acres in Patagonia to conserve and live on full-time. They planned to protect this tract of wilderness, using the fortune he made from fuelling people’s ambitions to explore the outdoors. * * * If Tompkins’s response to his dawning realisation that the apparel industry was damaging the environment was to sell his business and take direct action to save the Earth, then Chouinard, by contrast, decided to keep his company in private hands and run it in a way that might minimise environmental damage – a nearly impossible task that seems to weigh very heavily on him. “Evil always wins if we do nothing,” he writes in Let My People Go Surfing. The challenge of taking the moral high ground while still making and selling things is something that Rick Ridgeway also thinks about a great deal. “Our mission is to build the best product, causing no unnecessary harm, then that second part of our mission is essentially saying that we’ve got to do less bad,” he said. “We’re going to make our product with the smallest footprint possible, but it is a footprint.” For both men – who would not disagree with the radical environmentalist Edward Abbey’s famous remark that “growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell” – running an ethical business is an almost impossible challenge, if not a contradiction. Populating the world with more stuff that will eventually get thrown away is bad for the planet; the popularising of outdoor culture of all sorts is bad for specific places of natural beauty, which risk being overrun with people; and finally – and most difficult – the entire ethos of growth and profit and consumption is unsustainable for humanity and the health of the planet. Jill Dumain, the director of environment strategy, who has been at Patagonia for more than 27 years, can easily list all the ways the company is trying to do the right thing, among them the decision, in the 1990s, to use only organic cotton, and in 2013 to switch to torture-free goose down. (The North Face made the same move in 2014.) It has tried to replace as many of its synthetic materials as possible with recycled ones, although finding recycled zippers and buttons has been a struggle. Socially, it is committed to fair trade in its supply chain, in the mills and sewing factories it works with. This has led to the company splitting up with suppliers who were not willing or able to make the changes it demanded. These are the sorts of problems that Patagonia has chosen to explore to an almost obsessive degree. The idea of businesses being “transparent” is wholly overused but, in Patagonia’s case, it is fitting. Over time, Chouinard and Ridgeway matured into their roles as aging renegades: they appear as delightfully cranky old friends in a 2010 documentary, 180 Degrees South: Conquerors of the Useless, which follows a young writer and photographer as he attempts to retrace their now-legendary 1968 trip from California to Chile. Their adventures continued into December of 2015, when Chouinard, Ridgeway, Tompkins, and three other friends went on a seemingly gentle five-day kayaking trip to southern Chile. Ridgeway, who is 67, and Tompkins, 72, shared a kayak and it capsized in heavy waves in 4C water. The six men were rescued via patrol boat and helicopter but Tompkins suffered from severe hypothermia. He died in a hospital that night. “Doug had a visceral dislike for authority and always relished breaking the rules,” Chouinard wrote. It was a heartfelt tribute to his old friend. In his book, Chouinard comes off as a grumpy, seasoned old-timer, constantly bemoaning the lack of credibility in everyone, everywhere. “Yvon calls himself the biggest pessimist in the world,” says Dumain. Chouinard and his wife Malinda divide their time between Ventura and their long-time home in Jackson Hole, a mountain resort town in Wyoming now known as a playground for the super-rich – Harrison Ford, Sandra Bullock and Dick Cheney all have homes there. Patagonia employees talk about Chouinard with the devotion usually reserved for cult leaders, but with a tone that suggests that they also view him as a somewhat mercurial genius. “He spends a lot of time outdoors like he always has,” says Rose Marcario, Patagonia’s CEO, “a lot of time fishing, or teaching kids how to fish.” When I called, he was always off somewhere; no one seemed to know quite where. By keeping Patagonia as a privately owned business, Chouinard has been able to run it in a way that stays true to his values. (Patagonia is organised as a for-profit company, known as a B-Corp, with certification for its social and environmental commitment.) “When the company becomes the fatted calf, it’s sold for a profit, and its resources and holdings are often ravaged and broken apart, leading to the disruption of family ties and the long-term health of local economies,” he writes in Let My People Go Surfing. “When you get away from the idea that a company is a product to be sold to the highest bidder in the shortest amount of time, all future decisions in the company are affected.” Patagonia’s competitors, The North Face included, are mostly public companies driven by shareholders. “The mission and the values of Patagonia have never been really about that,” says Marcario. “They’ve been about how much influence we can have on preserving and conserving the wild places that we love and play in, and how much influence we can have as a business to help change the model.” But, while Tompkins left business altogether to save the wilderness, Chouinard seems like a man who will never stop being conflicted about what running a successful business entails. “Patagonia will never be completely socially responsible,” he has written. “It will never make a totally sustainable non-damaging product. But it is committed to trying.” * * * Patagonia’s headquarters are in Ventura, a small beach town in Southern California in between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles. The buildings occupy a 5.5-acre campus and are painted in a signature buttery ochre colour used in most of the Patagonia retail stores around the world. There’s a large playground for the onsite creche – an employee benefit so rare in the US that Patagonia published a book last summer about its child-friendly philosophy. The company prides itself in hiring relatively few people but looking after them all. There is something about being on the Patagonia campus that feels like being in a Scandinavian country – albeit one with banana plants, blooming agaves and jacaranda trees. There are solar panels, piles of surfboards for employees to use, and a car with a licence plate that reads BUMKIN. Offices have bean bags and stability balls to sit on, and the canteen serves organic kale blackberry salad. Then there’s the shed that originally housed Chouinard’s blacksmithing workshop, where he made climbing gear. It now feels a bit like a museum piece, frozen in the 1970s, but apparently Chouinard still tinkers around in it from time to time. The campus is the setting for many ostentatious efforts to do good. “One day I was walking down the steps and there were pieces of paper all over the sidewalks, and they all had arrows [on them] and said, ‘Careful. Watch out. Butterfly chrysalis,’” Dean Carter, the vice president of human resources, told me. If this conspicuous altruism is grating to some people, they do not work at Patagonia. Still, the company says that it does not only recruit environmentally conscious do-gooders. “If we picked people who fit a specific mould, it could feel really culty,” Carter said. “But we’re just looking for threads; we’re not looking for the entire quilt. We’re looking for threads of caring for the environment, threads of caring about the outdoors, and threads of caring about families, collaborating, working.” In a not-necessarily-cultish way, a lot of Patagonia employees go on to marry other Patagonia employees, and family members often work there too. Carter’s own daughter is a receptionist. Companies wishing to improve their public image drop by to see if a little ethical stardust will rub off on them. Coca-Cola flew in a team from South Africa. There was even a visit from Chick-Fil-A, the US fast food chain famous for taking a public stance against same-sex marriage in 2012. I registered my surprise. “Exactly! And I have a partner. So they asked me if they could come. I was kind of like, ‘Are you sure?’” Carter says. “And obviously we don’t share their values. But they have their very specific culture that they’re living. And they were really sweet and kind.” When Neil Blumenthal, co-founder of the fashionable eyewear startup Warby Parker, came to visit, he was impressed by how much work went into research and development – he mentioned the way Patagonia tests its raincoats with waters of various alkalinity to mimic rain in different parts of the world. But what really struck him, he said, was the venue for his meeting with two Patagonia executives: “Instead of taking the meeting in a conference room, we took a walk to the beach. For me it was pretty special; for them it was quite ordinary.” Ridgeway – whose job as vice president of public engagement is to represent the company, whether at conferences or universities, or to executives who come to the Ventura headquarters – described the process of meeting visitors: “They go on a tour, we walk around and talk about the values and how we live the values. Usually we get some local organically grown food and we answer questions and share a story,” Ridgeway told me. “And then we are curious what their story is.” Ridgeway can sometimes sound a little weary at having to explain to outsiders a way of life that comes quite naturally to him. “We don’t want to hold ourselves up in some arrogant exclusivity,” Ridgeway said, but then described the kind of customer that Patagonia does not “necessarily want to invite under our umbrella”. Namely, people who want to climb Mount Everest for bragging rights – the sort of affluent adventurers, drawn to climbing in part by Patagonia, whose impact Chouinard now regrets so much. “Someone who has paid $100,000 for a guided climb where the sherpas put the route in and risked their lives fixing the lines and carried all your stuff up for you and positioned your oxygen balls so you could go up and come back and say you climbed Everest. That doesn’t work for us,” Ridgeway says. “And we don’t mind saying it publicly.” In its pursuit of authenticity, Patagonia tries to avoid malls, and only takes over spaces that mean something to the community. (One of its four Manhattan stores is located on the Bowery, next to the former location of the punk club CBGB, which is now a John Varvatos boutique.) It prides itself on pushing up against the limits of how ethical a company can be while actually still selling things: quality goods, ethical labour and manufacturing, no debt, even a tax strategy, according to Chouinard’s book, “to pay our fair share and not a penny more”. The company is hyper-aware of these contradictions, perhaps to the point of tying itself in knots. In 2011, on Black Friday, the biggest shopping day of the year in the US, Patagonia ran an ad featuring a photo of a plush blue fleece, and copy that read DON’T BUY THIS JACKET. The advert invited customers to make a commitment to reduce what they buy, repair their gear and recycle the stuff they no longer need. (Patagonia’s campus in Reno, Nevada houses the largest garment repair facility in North America.) But it had the opposite effect: Patagonia’s Black Friday sales increased by 30% over the previous year. The anti-sales message, as they might have expected, made consumers feel better about buying more. The company’s attempts to expand into new markets have a similar blend of moral commitment and financial savvy. In 2013, it launched a venture fund to invest in environmentally and socially responsible for-profit startups. In 2012, the company launched a food line named Patagonia Provisions, which includes buffalo jerky, smoked wild Sockeye salmon and, beginning last October, a beer made with a grain called kernza, which can be grown year-round. The target market is “concerned moms that want to make sure they’re giving their kids organic, non-GMO food”, Rose Marcario told me. The new food division, she added, has won the company “a whole new set of customers”. * * * At the headquarters of The North Face in Alameda – just across the bay from San Francisco – there is a similar preoccupation with being green and avoiding waste. During a visit last summer, I had a lunch of sustainably raised salmon with Todd Spaletto, who became president of the company in 2011. The building where we dined was insulated with recycled blue jeans, and there were composting bins, solar panels and free charging stations for electric cars. One building housed a vast area dedicated to repairing clothes under the company’s lifetime warranty. As we ate, a team out on the lawn was testing out the set-up of a large, complicated-looking hexagonal tent. A visitor to The North Face campus encounters the same sporty feel as at Patagonia HQ – but instead of Patagonia’s crunchy “soul surfer” vibe, here there is an edge of elite athleticism, whether in the form of employees doing bootcamp workouts and agility drills in the well-equipped gym, or a casual mention that Dean Karnazes was there just the other day, leading a group run along the water. “One of my first weeks on the job, I was talking to somebody and they were like, ‘What are you doing this weekend?’” Spaletto recalled, smiling. “I was like, ‘I’m pretty excited, I’m running a half-marathon.’ And they were like” – and here he adopted a tone reserved for motivating small children – “‘That’s great, you gotta start somewhere!’” Lately The North Face has been focusing more and more on a younger, casual customer whose main interest in hiking is the part where they get to drink beer around a campfire. “Why does the youthful millennial consumer go outdoors?” Spaletto asked. “They value one thing above all else. It’s this whole idea of these genuine experiential moments that you share with your friends.” These youthful consumers may even decide they can afford to skip the hike and go straight to the beer. But as The North Face positions itself as a fashion brand as much as an outdoor wear company, a new dilemma arises. The casual customer is drawn both to style and to the authenticity of owning real technical gear – but if the gear itself announces its technical utility too loudly, it ceases to be fashionable. “The outdoor industry has prided itself on showing the technology on the outside – seams sealed, zippers taped. That is very much core to this industry, everybody does it,” said Sumie Scott, the senior product director for “mountain culture” at The North Face. “But the more youthful consumer wants hidden technology. So that’s the challenge, how do you get them to know that technology exists?” “What The North Face tries to push is this high, high performance extremity,” said Cathy Begien, who worked in visual merchandising at The North Face a decade ago, and has since gone on to work at Prada, Opening Ceremony, and Warby Parker. “They would say, ‘Cathy use Everest imagery or rock climbing.’ But I’m in a mall and people are pushing strollers around at 8am. I don’t think they care about whether an alpinist would want this, or an ultra-marathoner,” Begien recalled. “Holiday season was the only time I didn’t have to talk about mountain climbing or water rafting and could just show a bunch of jackets in a way the typical mall consumer can understand: this one is gonna keep you warm, this one is gonna keep you warmer, this one is gonna keep you warmest.” The high cost of North Face gear creates high expectations: “You get a fairly affluent customer who expects meticulous service. You have to behave as though you’re working at a Vuitton or a Gucci,” said Caitlin Kelly, a journalist who took a job at a North Face outlet in suburban New York after losing her reporting job during the 2008 recession, and wrote a book, titled Malled, about the experience. “It was a long, narrow store. And when you walked in, half the store was fashion, half was ‘Let’s climb Everest’. It was massively confusing to the shopper.” The North Face wants to do style and adventure. It has collaborated on slippers and puffer jackets with Supreme, the skateboarding brand with a cult following. (Drake wore a jacket from the collection in the video for his 2011 single The Motto.) The trend among makers of serious technical gear is for designs that don’t look like you are about to climb to Camp 4 on Everest – while at the same time, couture designers are increasingly showing items inspired by authentic outdoor gear. Patrik Ervell, Steven Alan and Louis Vuitton have all designed fleece jackets that appear to be a riff on Patagonia’s Retro-X; puffer jackets have started to appear on the covers of fashion magazines, thanks in part to Balenciaga’s $3,000 parkas. The desire to broadcast a sense of adventure while still looking good may have something to do with the biggest trend in athletic gear in recent years: the rise of “athleisure” – clothes that suggest, rather than insist on, performance, designed to transition from workout to sofa. Leggings – whether made by The Gap or Alexander Wang – are the most popular form of sporting loungewear (or is it lounging sportswear), having replaced denim as the preferred casual wear for women. The UK sportswear market will surpass £8bn by 2020, fuelled by the rise of athleisure. In addition to gear for high-altitude camping and open-water diving, both The North Face and Patagonia sell leggings and sweatpants and T-shirts and all manner of gear best suited for hanging out. But for The North Face, exercising feels like an urban moral imperative, much as recycling does at Patagonia – a duty to care for oneself in tandem with caring about nature. While The North Face nominally shares the same ethos as Patagonia in terms of protecting the planet, its status as a publicly traded company means it has to maximise profits, which goes with the company’s type-A branding – you are not going to see any North Face slow-growth manifestos or “Don’t Buy This Jacket” ads. In fact, after The North Face announced in October that its third-quarter revenue had dropped 1%, Spaletto, my summer lunch companion, quietly departed the company. If the risk for Patagonia is to be seen just like any other company – one that cares as much about profits as the environment – then the comparable risk for The North Face is to be associated with suburban parents and college students whose greatest trek is across the quad, rather than trailrunners, mountain climbers and the occasional well-dressed rapper. It has to remain authentic enough to represent authenticity for the casual customer, without being so authentic that those people stop buying. * * * “North Face has the misfortune of being east-coast prep-school girls wearing black puffers and Uggs,” says Matt Langer – a cyclist, New Mexico resident and Patagonia customer. He’s a friend of a friend whose Instagram looks like a real-life recreation of the Patagonia catalogue, complete with fly-fishing, long-distance mountain biking, an adorable dog and waterfalls. Patagonia’s marketing is spot on, he says, a bit sheepishly. “I am a bearded white guy drinking beer around the campfire.” For the committed outdoorsman – who styles himself a rugged individualist, untouched by the whims of fashion – there’s an ambivalence at being so accurately cast. That stereotype, says Josh Contois, who I met on a group hiking trip in California last year, “is to be a dirtbag and live frugally and also wear a $250 jacket”. (Outside Magazine once called Chouinard “King of the Dirtbags”.) Both Contois and Langer wear Patagonia in a way that would make Chouinard smile, even though much of their actual equipment comes from niche brands. For the real dirtbag, who now regards The North Face somewhat like McDonald’s or Wal-Mart, even Patagonia has mostly sold out to the urban yuppie. The true adventurer instead buys even more expensive, precious, and specialised gear – from tiny companies owned and operated by fellow mountaineers in outdoor meccas such as Boulder, Colorado or Bend, Oregon. “Let’s be honest, Patagonia appeals to – I don’t want to sound like a smartass – but people driving Range Rovers who shop at Whole Foods,” said Doug Heinrich, an executive at the Utah-based Black Diamond Equipment – Chouinard’s original climbing equipment company, which was renamed after he sold it to an employee in the 1980s. “That doesn’t mean they don’t appeal to core climbers, but we’re going to appeal to that hardcore climber more than Patagonia would.” On the other end of the spectrum, there is another crop of companies who appeal to the super-rich (or design fetishists) by trying to out-fancy Patagonia and The North Face on both technical sophistication and price. The small Canadian brand Arc’teryx produces a high-end line called Veilance, which promises “minimalist style with total performance”, and looks as if Prada made high-tech outdoor gear, with prices to match. Canada Goose, whose “Arctic luxury apparel” is worn by scientists at the South Pole, offers a “Kensington” Parka priced at £850. There is something undeniably alluring about the lengthy descriptions of the technical merits of all this cutting-edge gear: the insulation that traps air for reduced heat loss and increased warmth, the underarm vents, the wrist accessory pocket, the reminder that your jacket is coming with a lifetime warranty, even if it isn’t destined to leave the borough of Manhattan. That, after all, was always the bedrock of high fashion – people justified the prices of a cashmere sweater or a leather jacket because what they bought was well made, beautifully crafted, and lasted for ever. This may be what appeals to such customers as the man who recently came into the San Francisco North Face store and bought a Himalayan suit, which is filled with goose down and costs $1,000. The sales copy describes the item thus: “Technical, insulated full-body suit for climbing 8,000-metre peaks, the Himalayan Suit is a necessity for athletes aiming to reach the top of the world.” It looks like a yellow and black sleeping bag with arms and legs and, according to the catalogue, includes “critical features based on Conrad Anker’s feedback and proven on Mount Everest, where the athlete team successfully reached summit”. The staff at The North Face store asked the customer where he was planning on going with his Himalayan suit. Nowhere, he said. He was just buying it because it was cool. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here. • This article was amended on 9 March 2017.

42,article,travel/2017/feb/19/tesla-los-angeles-las-vegas-teslaloop-eco-road-trip-california,Travel,2017-02-19,Eco road trip: Los Angeles to Las Vegas by Tesla,https://gu.com/p/5kg7a,Lifestyle,Eco road trip: Los Angeles to Las Vegas by Tesla,"<p>A teenager has launched a green car service between LA and Vegas, using Tesla electric vehicles. Stephanie Theobald gets a lift and finds the conversation as fascinating as the technology</p>",1111,"Stephanie (my namesake, as it happens) has a wicked grin on her face as she flips open the boot of the car. We’re about to embark on a road trip from Los Angeles to Las Vegas but I suspect this is going to be very different from the one chronicled by Hunter S Thompson. In 1971’s Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, the trunk of his Great Red Shark resembled a “mobile police narcotics lab” filled with blotter acid, cocaine and quarts of tequila. Our black Tesla Model X is stocked with gluten-free, non-GMO protein bars and organic energy drinks. Tesloop, a pioneering long-distance shuttle service launched in 2015, is like a better class of Uber, using the Lamborghini of eco-cars: the Tesla. Tesloop’s founder, 17-year-old Haydn Sonnad, had the idea of leasing the cars and charging from $59 for the Los Angeles to Las Vegas route (an airfare can be triple that) and $35 for the new Los Angeles to Palm Springs route. Sonnad estimates that the LA to Vegas trip will save up to 70kg of carbon emissions, but the main buzz for customers is that the Tesla is the brainchild of LA visionary Elon Musk, who is also behind SpaceX, the company that aims to make the Earth-Mars route a viable option. I’ve heard that a Teslas drives itself, and as we get in the Model X (more like a falcon than a shark, thanks to De Lorean-style doors that open upwards) a figure from the Tesloop office appears on an iPhone on the dashboard. She talks about the “radars,” “sonars” and “front-facing cameras” that allow the car to accelerate, brake and steer for itself. “Basically,” she says, “your pilot doesn’t have to use their hands or feet while driving on the highway today!” Stephanie has three passengers: Whitney, an accountant in her 30s; Julius, an events organiser off to Sin City to celebrate his birthday with friends; and me. The Model X can carry six passengers (as opposed to three in the Model S sedan), so we have plenty of room. We’re all excited. “I feel like we could drive under water in this thing,” exclaims Whitney. I feel like we’re going to blast off!” Julius adds. Sonnad sums it up: “Tesloop is a new kind of road trip. It’s clean and green and by far the safest way to travel by car.” At a Tesla Motors shareholders’ meeting in 2015 (he purchased one share for $210 to get in) he stood up and pointed out to Musk that Teslas weren’t being used over long distances. He was planning to use them for two return journeys to Palm Springs each day and one return trip to Las Vegas. It was a bold publicity blast for his fledgling company and his father, Rahul, helped raise much of the investment. Tesloop started with one leased Tesla Model S, which normally does the Las Vegas drive, and now also has three model X SUVs in its fleet. New routes are planned in Texas. This month Tesloop announced that bookings had increased to the point at which the company was covering all operational expenses. It has also signed a technology agreement with Goodyear: the tyre giant is curious about the performance of electric cars over huge distances. (Tesloop’s first 2015 Tesla Model S has now done more than 250,000 miles.) Sonnad, too, is optimistic – even given a new president who doesn’t seem too down with the eco world. “People in LA have always been willing to try new stuff, and now it’s really paying off,” he says with a smile. I had worried that this trip might be a bit worthy, but 10 minutes into our 278-mile drive, our “pilot,” a pro inline skater, “hemp activist” and musician, is talking about a recent ayahuasca ceremony in Joshua Tree (ayahuasca is a hallucinogenic plant medicine from the Amazon that induces visions). Whitney, off to Vegas for a weekend of shows and “all you can eat crab leg buffets”, nods matter-of-factly and asks if Stephanie has tried the shamanic “frog poison cleanse”. (Stephanie has.) Julius talks about his last Tesloop trip to Vegas, when he shared the car with Mariah Carey’s DJ, Suss One. Like Julius, Suss hates flying. Julius is not bothered by the less rock’n’roll aspects of travelling to Vegas in a Tesla. “You don’t want to peak too early,” he reasons, sucking on a free carton of coconut water. There is fast wifi and headphones if you don’t feel like chatting. Stephanie occasionally puts on favourite podcasts: one about the bitcoin currency, and another on the antiviral properties of mushrooms. Every so often a bell sounds, signifying that Stephanie has put the car in self-drive mode. She tells us that, strictly speaking, the Tesla is only semi-autonomous. Musk reckons it will be another couple of years before you’ll be able to go to sleep at the wheel. Still, it all feels very modern, and Tesloop is at the forefront of LA transport ideas. Only a couple of years ago you’d have been laughed out of town if you’d suggested holidaying here without hiring a car. But even Angelenos are realising that something has to give. Carpooling has become as normal as juice cleansing thanks to Uber, and in the November elections, Los Angeles County voters approved “Measure M”, to provide nearly $42bn for new rail and rapid transit options as well as bike share expansion. Last May, a new metro line, the Expo, linked downtown LA to Santa Monica, and new bike sharing schemes in Venice, Santa Monica and West Hollywood are proving popular. But as Sonnad has realised, cars are not going to go away. We just need to make more of them electric and let ourselves be driven more. Including a 40-minute stop in Barstow to charge the battery at a Tesla station, we arrive in Vegas in just under five hours. We’re certainly not “bucking and skidding with a bottle of rum in one hand and jamming the horn to drown out the music”, as Thompson was, but Julius seems to be high on organic chia seeds and coconut water. Stephanie drops him and me off at the new W hotel. He’s meeting his buddies here – they’ve hired the penthouse designed by Lenny Kravitz and Philippe Starck. Julius chuckles: “I heard they have, like, mirrors above the bed.” You can bring in the new but you don’t necessarily have to chuck out all of the old. Way to go The journey was provided by Tesloop.com, from Los Angeles to Las Vegas from $59pp one-way. Accommodation was provided by the W Las Vegas (doubles from $150 room only).",https://media.guim.co.uk/28ada68a217060a649498edc5bd3ca5e5456b606/0_48_2198_1319/500.jpg,0.1743387063273427

Fifty years later, San Franciscans can order delivery of a joint with an app and marry a same-sex partner at city hall, but bureaucratic approval for a concert celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Summer of Love is out of reach. On 7 February, the San Francisco recreation and parks department denied a permit to the anniversary concert in a harsh letter to concert organizer Boots Hughston, citing his “numerous ‘misrepresentations of material fact’” in his dealings with the department. “The Summer of Love was an incredible moment in our city’s history and its message of peace and love is more important than ever,” the department wrote, citing concerns over safety before adding: “We cannot put the public at risk and grant a permit for your proposed event.” The denial is a major setback for Hughston, who had been planning to host a free day-long concert featuring, among others, Eric Burdon and War, Country Joe McDonald, and the remaining members of Jefferson Airplane. Hughston, who previously organized a 40th anniversary Summer of Love concert, had hoped to secure an appearance by the Dalai Lama to this year’s celebration but, he said, “his holiness was booked in LA”. “The whole thing about the 50th anniversary is that we are marking our generation and what our generation accomplished,” Hughston said. “We impeached presidents. We started all these movements: the environmental movement, the free speech movement, the feminist movement.” “It’s because the whole generation woke up and realized that there was more to life than just working everyday and spending your whole life sitting at a desk,” he added. Visitors to San Francisco throughout 2017 will have no dearth of events at which to wear flowers in their hair. Museums around the Bay Area will host Summer of Love-themed exhibits, and annual street festivals will probably see a boost in flower-power accessories. One tour company will even take visitors around town in an authentic Volkswagen “love bus” complete with beaded curtains, shag carpet, and neon blue seats. Hughston blamed the city for “dragging its feet” throughout the permit process, which he said he had been working on for nine months. He also accused the city of favoring large, corporate events that can pay millions of dollars in fees. He plans to appeal against the permit denial at a hearing on Thursday. More than 1,300 people have signed an online petition asking the mayor to allow the concert to go forward. Hughston did take some comfort from the fact that it took the original Human Be-In two attempts to get a permit as well. After being denied on his first attempt, organizer Michael Bowen asked his friend Melvin Belli for help. In 2004 Bowen told the the San Francisco Bay Guardian how Belli, a famous attorney, “sent his secretary downtown and asked and received in five minutes a permit for his birthday party at the Polo Field. Jan 14 was not even his birthday.” Representatives of the city and the mayor’s office did not immediately respond to queries from the Guardian. Hearkening back to the Summer of Love may seem incongruous to American’s experiencing a Trump-induced winter of discontent. But to Hughston, young people in 2017 can learn lessons from the hippies of the 60s. “You have power in your own individual thinking,” he said. “If you say to yourself, ‘I’m not going to eat that GMO food and I’m not going to put up with Donald Trump,’ you can do it.” Hughston also advised that young people seek out the spirit of the Summer of Love at events like Burning Man. Country Joe McDonald, who was part of the Summer of Love scene and played Woodstock with Country Joe and the Fish, had a more modest view of the anniversary. “To me, it’s not really important to mark the anniversary of the Summer of Love, but I like to play free music in the park,” he said. McDonald will play at the anniversary concert, if it is allowed to go forward. But he said he was unsure whether the celebrating the Summer of Love five decades later has much relevance. “It is the past,” he said. “It holds meaning to people who are old.”",https://media.guim.co.uk/9b41f1bf8e5198d3876ca59d66beda9fe50479eb/0_233_3710_2227/500.jpg,0.2488203463203463
44,article,business/2016/sep/14/bayer-takeover-monsanto-66-billion-deal,Business,2016-09-14,Bayer's $66bn takeover bid of Monsanto called a 'marriage made in hell',https://gu.com/p/532j5,News,Bayer's $66bn takeover bid of Monsanto called a 'marriage made in hell',"<p>Vermont senator Bernie Sanders leads outcry over merger, saying deal is ‘a threat to all Americans’ and should be blocked by regulators</p>",753,"German chemical giant Bayer’s $66bn (£50bn) deal to buy controversial US agrochemical giant Monsanto and create the world’s largest seeds and pesticides company is “a threat to all Americans” and should be blocked, Bernie Sanders said on Wednesday. Speaking shortly after the deal was announced, the Vermont senator, who ran against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, said: “The attempted takeover of Monsanto by Bayer is a threat to all Americans.” “These mergers boost the profits of huge corporations and leave Americans paying even higher prices. Not only should this merger be blocked, but the Department of Justice should reopen its investigation of Monsanto’s monopoly over the seed and chemical market.” He called for the proposed takeover to be blocked and for a fresh investigation into Monsanto’s current control of the seed market. The proposed deal, the biggest corporate takeover deal so far this year, follows a wave of consolidation in the seeds and agriculture industry and has raised concerns among politicians, scientists, regulators, farmers and activists who called the deal a “marriage made in hell”. Werner Baumann, chief executive of Bayer, which is most famous for developing aspirin, said “the combination of our two great organizations [will] deliver substantial value to shareholders, our customers, employees and society at large”. But farmers and environmentalists warned the deal could lead to a reduction in seed variety, an increase in genetically modified crops and higher seed costs and therefore crop and food prices. The proposed takeover is likely to face intense regulatory scrutiny in the US and Europe, particularly as it quickly follows two other mega-deals in the agriculture industry and would leave control of almost two-thirds of the world’s seeds and pesticides in the hands of three firms. Analysts at Bernstein Research said they thought there was only a 50:50 chance of the deal winning regulatory clearance. “We believe political pushback to this deal, ranging from farmer dissatisfaction with all their suppliers consolidating in the face of low farm net incomes to dissatisfaction with Monsanto leaving the United States, could provide significant delays and complications,” they said in a research note. Because of the difficulties expected in getting the deal through, Bayer has agreed to pay Monsanto $2bn if the tie-up falls apart because of competition concerns. Friends of the Earth described the takeover, which will see Bayer pay $128 per share – a 44% premium on Monsanto’s share price before the proposed deal was first revealed in May, as a “marriage made in hell”. Adrian Bebb, Friends of the Earth’s food and farming campaigner, said the proposed takeover “threatens to further lock in industrialised agriculture at the expense of nature, farmers and the wider public” and warned that “this mega corporation will be doing its best to force damaging pesticides and GM seeds into our countryside”. Campaigners promised further protests, which have already been held around the world since Bayer made its first approach for Monsanto in May. They are concerned that the deal could lead to Monsanto, which has been described as “the most evil company in the world” for its role in developing deadly herbicide Agent Orange in the 1960s and more recently its role at the forefront of genetically engineered crops, could introduce GMO seeds in Europe. Hugh Grant, Monsanto’s Scottish chief executive, hit out at environmentalists saying their concern about GM crops “drives me a little bit nuts” and said they should be more worried about how to feed a fast-growing global population while using less water as global temperatures rise. “You think about two billion new citizens, you think about a warming planet. You think about water. These are appropriate conversations,” he said in an interview with CNN on Wednesday. “The thing that drives me a little bit nuts. The frustrating piece is this is such a polarized debate. And I don’t think it should be because we’re going to need all these kinds of agriculture.” John Colley, professor of international business at Warwick Business School said: “Bayer’s acquisition of ‘Frankenstein’ crop producer Monsanto could be a horror story for both Bayer and its customers: the farmers.” “Apart from Monsanto’s shareholders, who have hit the jackpot, this looks like a lose-lose bid. Bayer have been forced into paying too much and face major integration and competition authority risks. “The farmers will lose out as product ranges are rationalised and attempts are made to increase prices.” Bayer’s shares were up 1.3% to €105.60 in afternoon trading in Frankfurt, and Monsanto shares were 1.1% higher at $107.20 in New York.",https://media.guim.co.uk/1b1ec25e5e9db49851521efb391e447e9238fdc8/0_194_4500_2700/500.jpg,0.12529417552144825
45,article,us-news/2016/aug/14/florida-keys-zika-virus-genetically-modified-mosquitoes,World news,2016-08-14,Zika virus: Floridians fear 'Pandora's box' of genetically altered mosquitos,https://gu.com/p/4qtjh,News,Zika virus: Floridians fear 'Pandora's box' of genetically altered mosquitos,<p>Scientists say Key Haven is the ‘perfect’ island for releasing the genetically modified insects – but locals refuse to be ‘lab rats’ in FDA-cleared experiment<br></p>,1633,"The Florida Keys are three months away from a straw poll vote on whether to release millions of genetically modified mosquitoes on an island just east of Key West, and the tourist destination is awash in lawn signs. Alongside the typical signs to vote for court clerk, judge, sheriff or school board are signs that showcase the overhead view of a mosquito and read: “NO CONSENT to release of genetically modified mosquitoes”. For the last five years, the biotechnology company Oxitec has been developing a plan to experimentally release the GMO mosquitoes in the Keys, which scientists hope could eventually impede the spread of the Zika virus. “It is the perfect scientific trial site,” said Derric Nimmo, a spokesman for Oxitec and a molecular biologist, about Key Haven. “Wouldn’t it be wonderful if the Keys mosquito control district could say, ‘We don’t have Aedes aegypti here – you can’t get dengue or Zika?’” Each male mosquito released by Oxitec will carry a gene to prevent his offspring from reaching adulthood. Scientists hope that the genetically modified males will mate with wild females to undercut the population of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the type that spread Zika through Brazil. But the prospect of ridding the neighborhood of a disease-carrying pest hasn’t quelled public dissatisfaction. The GM mosquitoes dominate local news in Key West. Mosquito control commissioners up for reelection face multiple opponents. The city of Key West formally opposed the mosquitoes’ introduction in 2012. “Why are you pushing [sic] down our throats?” asked Mila de Mier, a Spanish transplant to Key West and a real estate agent. She has led the charge against the mosquitoes’ release, collecting nearly 170,000 signatures in an online petition against the experiment. “It’s about human rights – this can’t be pushed down our throats without consent,” said De Mier, who views her mission as helping mold policy on genetically modified animals for the country. If the trial goes well, the technology would be on track to commercial approval in the United States, opening a slice of the nation’s $14bn pest control market to the company. Globally, analysts predict Oxitec’s mosquito could bring in up to $400m in annual sales for its parent company, Intrexon. With millions in potential sales at stake, the experiment in the environmentally sensitive, populous area hinges on the fundamental question proposed by opponents: do the people who live where an experiment is to be conducted have a right to decide whether to go forward? ‘No consent’ Signs saying “No consent” are scattered across what looks like about half the front yards in Key Haven, a neighborhood of neat, high-end homes where the streets stretch out into the Gulf of Mexico like fingers. The neighborhood is distinctly, extravagantly Floridian. Corinthian columns stand astride stucco doorways, balancing arches of hurricane-shuttered homes. Large boats park in driveways. Glass front doors reveal infinity pools and Gulf vistas. For some in the neighborhood, the question of Oxitec’s trial is one of convenience. “It would be so buggy,” said Andrea Spottswood, 62, a prim woman who wears a pressed button-up, pink lipstick and large diamond earrings. The trial “may be worth a try”, but “we don’t want to be the lab rats, and they were all going to be dumped down this street.” She, like others in the neighborhood, is skeptical of the company’s basic claims. “They say this mosquito doesn’t bite, but I don’t know if I’m buying it,” Spottswood said. Oxitec’s plan is to mostly release male mosquitoes, which don’t bite. Its application with the FDA says that only one out of every 1,000 mosquitoes would be female. Asked whether the trial could advance science, Spottswood said, “Right. They’re also going to make a lot of money.” Intrexon appears keenly aware of this. Though Nimmo has said Oxitec is running a mainly door-to-door public education-style campaign aimed at Monroe county’s 52,000 voters, Intrexon has intensely lobbied Congress. By April, the large international law firm Sidley Austin LLP estimated Intrexon paid at least $400,000 for the firm to advocate for Oxitec’s mosquitoes, hoping to hurry along approval and secure government funding. Behind another “No consent” sign lives Joan Lord-Papy, 85, a native islander. Inside her home, daytime TV rambles. For Lord-Papy, memories of mosquito swarms are vivid. An island divided Lord-Papy recalls a time, in the 1950s, when mosquitoes were so bad that drivers “picked up anybody who broke down” on “the 18-mile stretch” between Florida City to Key Largo out of sympathy for the hundreds of bites they would endure. Others recounted the lore of motorists who preferred sleeping in their vehicle to changing a flat at dusk, when ambush by bloodsuckers was certain. Lord-Papy herself served on the Florida Keys Mosquito Control Board for 20 years beginning in 1962. Mosquito populations on the island have declined significantly over the decades, with the institution of a robust mosquito control program. “I’m local. I was born and raised here, so I’ve always known mosquitoes and what they do to the community,” she said. But, she admits, “I really don’t know that much about the spray they want to use. I don’t know how it will affect children, really.” Phil Goodman views this sort of opposition as an uninformed electorate standing in the way of science. Goodman is one of the two holdouts on the Keys mosquito control board, and also its chairman, who has refused to abide by the public opinion. A former chemist and chemical company owner, Goodman complains that people call Oxitec’s OX513A patented insects “franken-skeeters”. “We’re in the public health business, not the public opinion business,” he said. The board, he believes, “will make a better decision than the majority of uninformed people.” Oxitec was, in fact, invited to the island by the county’s mosquito control commissioners, a group once in favor of the experiment, but who are now divided after years of public outcry. The vote on the mosquito release is non-binding, and three of five mosquito control board members have agreed to abide by the outcome. “Let’s have a scientific debate and come to some kind of conclusion,” Goodman said. Goodman fears a slippery slope, where every new insecticide will require public approval. The district has already invested in the experiment. It donated space to Oxitec to build a laboratory in Marathon, in the middle Keys, and expects to donate up to $200,000 in free labor each year the experiment goes forward. Certainly, the current methods employed by mosquito control districts against the Aedes are imperfect. The notoriously difficult-to-control bug was nearly eradicated in the 1950s by governments in Latin America, who undertook a military-style campaign to spray DDT inside homes. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes also spread dengue, yellow fever and chikungunya, diseases with potentially life-threatening symptoms. Miami-Dade County began spraying Naled in August, after the first mainland cases of Zika transmitted by local mosquitoes were found in the Wynwood neighborhood. About 6m Floridian acres are sprayed each year. But Naled’s effectiveness in Aedes control is widely debated, both for its effectiveness and its adverse impacts. “I got a complaint the other day – someone found 30 dead bees on the side of the road,” Goodman said. Naled kills just about any flying insect the size of a mosquito aloft when planes spray overhead. Public education can also only go so far. In the Keys, ubiquitous door hangers remind residents to empty standing pools of water. Aedes mosquitoes can breed in pools as tiny as a bottle cap, making every wrinkle of a tarp potential habitat. Goodman suspects some Aedes mosquitoes are breeding in abandoned cisterns on the islands, which used to supply residents’ water. Oxitec’s trial wouldn’t be the first one the company conducts, nor the last. The company has released GMO mosquitoes in Brazil, Panama, Malaysia and recently the Cayman Islands. And it has submitted applications to begin trials in Sri Lanka and India. The longest such trial has been approximately two years, increasing Keys residents’ concerns about unknown long-term consequences. Most trials have resulted in reduced Aedes populations, Oxitec has said. Nimmo cites a 90% or better rate of reduction in most populations. But the same rate of effectiveness is likely to be significantly lower in locations with more complex geography. Opponents have raised other concerns as well: for every 1,000 mosquitoes released, one will be female, the sort that bite. De Mier and other opponents ask: what happens if a female Oxitec mosquito bites a woman? What if it passes the “kill gene”, as opponents call it, to people? Oxitec scientists analyzed the saliva of roughly six mosquitoes, the gene was not detected, and scientists concluded that humans were unlikely to be exposed. But that hasn’t soothed critics. “Opening this Pandora’s box, sometimes you don’t see the impact until five, 10, 15 years down the road,” De Mier said. “I’m not against genetically modified at all,” she said. “Sometimes, I don’t know what I put on my table, but that’s the difference – it’s about choice,” she said, referencing the GMO food supply. “Permission has not been asked or given … This is only for Oxitec’s benefit.” What about the impact on tourism, de Mier asked? The Keys depend almost solely on visitors to the warm teal waters for income, with the hotel occupancy rates near 100% in February and March, and tens of thousands of visitors arriving from around the world in winter months. Meagan Hull, 45, another local opponent, said she decided against a vacation after learning Oxitec would release the mosquitoes on the Cayman Islands. “Now, I don’t want to go to the Caymans. I mean, come on, they’re ruining the world for us!” De Mier said: “You see how pretty is this place. If you’re not going to fight for here, where are you going to fight for? I’m going all the way.”",https://media.guim.co.uk/79ba8539b0f422e8ea2d019b429f9e67f3a4d9ce/0_105_3872_2323/500.jpg,0.057609369505377914
46,article,society/2016/jul/11/snowflake-arizona-environmental-illness,US news,2016-07-11,Allergic to life: the Arizona residents 'sensitive to the whole world',https://gu.com/p/4nm9b,News,Allergic to life: the Arizona residents 'sensitive to the whole world',"<p>In Snowflake, people tell <strong>Kathleen Hale</strong> they have found refuge in the desert to escape fragrances, electricity, Wi-Fi and other facets of modern life</p>",3800,"A lot of things caused Susie pain: scented products, pesticides, plastic, synthetic fabrics, smoke, electronic radiation – the list went on. Back in “the regular world”, car exhaust made her feel sick for days. Perfume gave her seizures. Then she uprooted to Snowflake, Arizona. “I got out of the car and didn’t need my oxygen tank,” she said, grinning at me in the rearview mirror. “I could walk.” There are about 20 households where she now lives. Like Susie, most of the residents in Snowflake have what they call “environmental illness”, a controversial diagnosis that attributes otherwise unexplained symptoms to pollution. My knees knocked together as she swerved on to another dirt road. Mae, a Guardian film-maker, was busy shooting scenery from the front seat. We’d come for four days to find out why dozens of people chose to make their homes here, and Susie had agreed to host us only if we did not seek outside opinion from psychiatrists regarding their condition. “He’s got it bad,” she said, nodding at a neighbor’s driveway. The sign out front read: “NO UNINVITEDS”. My eyes darted on barbed wire cattle fences and dead Juniper trees. White mountains swam in the distance. We stopped, and Susie motioned for Mae to open a gate decorated in yellow Christmas tinsel. The idea that modern conveniences cause pain dates to the mid-19th century. In 1869, doctor George Beard published several papers blaming modern civilization and steam power for ailments such as “drowsiness, cerebral irritation, pain, pressure and heaviness in the head”. According to him, other indications of chemical sensitivity included “fear of society, fear of being alone, fear of contamination … fear of fears … fear of everything”. He called the illness neurasthenia. Susie called it being “sensitive to the whole world”. Susie had warned us that Deb, a sort-of-roommate who lived in her driveway, was extremely sensitive to scents. In order to protect her, we’d agreed to various terms: we would not a get rental car or stay at a motel, because those were places where chemical cleaners were used. We would wear Susie’s clothes, and sleep at Susie’s house. She also made us swear not to get any perms before we came, which made me think she had been in the desert for a long time. For weeks, Mae and I avoided makeup, lotion, perfume, hair products, scented detergent, fabric softener, dryer sheets. We used fragrance-free soap and shampoo, as well as a natural deodorant, which, according to the description on the box, was basically a rock picked off the ground with a cap on it. Despite our best efforts, Deb’s sensitive nose picked up our body odors. For her, we reeked like a Bath and Body Works store flooded with vodka – or as she put it, “floral, with chemical solvents. You’re fragrant.” Snowflake was not easy to get to. I’d risen at dawn, vomited on a tiny six-passenger plane, and walked one mile down a busy highway in a town called Show Low (160 miles from Phoenix) to get to Susie’s car. “We’ll do our best to get you cleaned,” Susie promised us. “I got lots of hydrogen peroxide.” It was decided that the best way to get us straight from the car into the shower, where we could wash the outside world’s chemicals away, was to enter the house completely naked. So we took off our clothes and marched without dignity across the gravel driveway. “You can have first shower,” Mae said, wrapping herself in a towel. We had only known each other for a few hours. Susie’s bathroom, like the rest of her one-room, off-grid house, was wallpapered in heavy duty Reynolds wrap. Above the toilet, a small, sealed window looked out at the desert. I scrubbed off with a bar of olive oil soap and inhaled the metallic scent of hard water. It was the only thing I could smell. Someone knocked. Mae reluctantly asked if I wore underwear. “We’re playing dress-up!” Susie shouted from the other room. I realized what Mae actually meant was, Did I wear Susie’s underwear? I hesitated for a moment, considering the alternative: going commando in a sandy environment. “Hey, Kathleen!” Susie yelled. “Do you?” “I wear underwear,” I called. Later, we gathered in the kitchen. Deb is sensitive to grains, GMO foods, preservatives and all artificial flavoring and coloring, so we ate cabbage soup for dinner. Afterward, Mae and I ducked behind a curtained-off partition to consider our sleeping arrangements: two metal cots, one broken, and zero blankets, (because blankets are absorbent and, according to local logic, our pores were still “off-gassing” dangerous chemicals). Nighttime in the desert is freezing, and Susie’s house did not have heating. I wanted to be unconscious and regretted my semi-recent decision to start weaning off sedatives. Asked whether she might at least have some padding to cover the iron springs, Susie retreated outside, shouting over her shoulder, “FYI, the rats here are aggressive.” She returned with dirt-caked bathmats. “There,” she said, turning off the lights. “Comfy.” That night Mae and I, who were complete strangers just the day before, had to hold each other for warmth. I reminded myself that whatever discomfort we felt paled in comparison to how Susie and Deb had suffered in the regular world. Susie grew up in forested northern California, and spent most of the 1970s in the Bay Area, working odd jobs and traveling with her boyfriend. As friends started dropping like flies from an illness nobody could understand, Susie endured respiratory, gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms. It hurt her feelings when doctors suggested she might just have anxiety. While the Aids epidemic kicked into crisis mode, Susie’s symptoms got worse, intensifying whenever she smelled smoke or saw power lines. Unable to function, she moved back home, where, through an autodidactic game of trial and error, she identified what triggered her worst symptoms. She slept on her parents’ porch, or on the bathroom floor, because those were the only places she could breathe. Her mother collected rain for her to drink. Now using a wheelchair, she returned to San Francisco to pursue a master’s degree in disability policy. She launched the Reactor, an environmental illness advocacy newsletter, which circulated via an underground network of hypersensitive people throughout the country. An environmentally ill reader told Susie the air where he lived was “clean enough for him to manage” and in 1994, Susie followed him to Snowflake, where the tiny community (only a handful of people at the time) immediately rallied around her. Within a year, her father and neighbors pooled their resources to build her a house – “a little, safe place”. Meanwhile, across the country, Deb’s life had never felt more dangerous. Like Susie, her initial thought was Aids. After ruling that out, she juggled endless skepticism. Even those who believed she felt ill wrote it off, saying she’d bounce back. Deb had always been strong. As a child living on Lake Michigan, she sailed and played sports. After attending Michigan Technological University, she worked for nine years as the only female metallurgical engineer at Bendix aircraft; her specialty was failure analysis. When she and her husband became pregnant, Deb kept working, inhaling zinc and cadmium – nobody told her not to – but all she could smell were her co-worker’s cologne and aftershave. Scented products sent her body into crisis. She vomited a lot. After giving birth in 1992, Deb left work to parent full time. She lived in a moldy house with a smoky furnace. Infections blow-torched her sinuses, turning into migraines that hit her like an ax. Her weight plummeted to 75lbs. Doctors said she was anorexic. Finally, Deb couldn’t take it anymore. She left Michigan when her daughter was 16 and became itinerant, sleeping in her truck, because unlike plastic or drywall, metal emitted no chemical fumes and was safe. The same word-of-mouth network eventually led Deb to Snowflake, where she performed chores for the environmentally sick in exchange for food. By the time Susie spotted her boiling out clothes for a neighbor, Deb had been living in her truck for five years and needed a place to park. The two women became a domestic duo. Deb cooked “clean food” for Susie on the hot plate. They made each other laugh, and protected one another. Susie remained compassionately straight-faced when Deb finally admitted she hadn’t seen her daughter in seven years. By the age of 67, Susie had finally put her master’s degree to use, although not in the way she had originally intended. She had become Snowflake’s unofficial welcome wagon, local therapist and advocate. She sat with men and women who were sick with something no one else believed in, and she believed them. She fielded at least five long phone calls a night from the bedridden and lonely, talking to them for as long as they needed company. She helped people with the arduous paperwork involved in collecting government aid. She reassured them that their illness wouldn’t kill them – it would only “hurt, a lot”. Everyone we met loved her, and got tears in their eyes when they said so. Historically speaking, settlers’ reasons for uprooting typically establish the hierarchy of wherever they resettle. Puritans relocated for religious reasons, so the devout became popular. Forty-niners rushed in search of gold, and those that struck it gained status. But people came to Snowflake to nurture disease, and so, here, illness acts like a social currency. Being “normies”– a mostly derogative term meaning that chemical fragrances and electricity didn’t (yet) cause us debilitating pain – not only dropped Mae and I into a category of people who had historically hurt, abandoned, and misdiagnosed everyone we were about to meet, it also ranked us as lepers. Luckily, I was about to become very sick. On day two, I woke with a headache, and Mae’s hair in my mouth. My headache was snowballing into nausea. I was starting to feel familiar, flu-like symptoms which pave the way for emotional darkness. I had begged to write about Snowflake because I identified with the idea of sick people retreating to the middle of nowhere to find peace. Almost two years earlier, I had a mental breakdown and retreated to a psychiatric hospital for two weeks. Medication and therapy brought me back to reality. I felt I recognized the urge to leave everything behind. In the almost two years since my mental breakdown, sticking to the to-do list they gave us at the psychiatric hospital (sleep; eat; take medication) had, at the very least, made me feel in control. Now, each item had been compromised thanks to our sleeping arrangements, the unsatisfying house staple (cabbage), and my personal desire to, at some point, become pregnant with a baby that did not resemble an octopus. “I’m starting to think now might not have been the best time to start tapering off psychotropic drugs,” I said to Mae, who barely heard me. “There’s a situation,” she replied. In the kitchen, Susie and Deb revealed that trust issues had developed between us. The night before, Mae and I decided to charge her camera battery, and apparently it had kept Susie awake. “But we could hear her snoring,” I said. “You hurt her,” Deb said. They wanted to know how they could be sure that we weren’t just another pair of journalists here to play games – to test their disease with shenanigans, and make fun of them? Deb said we couldn’t fool her. As proof, she relayed a story about how, once, when her daughter was “10 or 12” they’d gone together to the grocery store. “I lost track of her and her friend,” Deb said, smirking proudly, “and then I found them, and I could smell it. They claimed, ‘No, no, no,’ but I knew they’d gone and done perfume samples. So, we’re in the car, and they’re giggling to themselves, and I told them to get out.” That was the end of the story. “Did you make them get out of the car?” I said “Well, yeah,” she said, looking confused. “We were only about three miles from home.” She turned the car around “eventually”. But I couldn’t help seeing it from the daughter’s point of view: a friend had come over, they’d been left on the highway. I worried we were about to get kicked out, too. Deb said, in order to trust us going forward, we had to promise we weren’t going to write anything but a positive piece that would clearly inform readers of the clinical validity of environmental illness. “We can’t promise that,” Mae said. A general silence fell over the aluminum foil room. Deb, who had been pretty emotionless up until now, looked like she might cry. Our chance at writing a story seemed to be disintegrating. So I cleared my throat and prepared to overshare in order to hopefully diffuse things. “I’ll tell you a secret,” I said. I told Susie and Deb that I knew how it felt, at least a little bit, “to be sick, and have nobody believe you”, I explained how, four or five years earlier, my hair started falling out, and I had this awful, burning sensation on the back of my scalp that was so intense I used a bag of ice as a pillow, and how I felt nauseous all the time, and tired, and cried a lot. The word “diarrhea” had already been introduced a number of times by Susie and Deb to describe their own symptoms, so I plugged that in, too. They softened. When I got to the part about how every other doctor I saw that year said I was fine, physically speaking, and had referred me to a psychiatrist, they scoffed knowingly and protectively. They asked what my environment had been like; I thought they meant emotionally so I told them how I moved to New York for this guy, James, and we signed a lease together, broke up after one month – then I lost my job, and had no savings – “la-la-la”. Susie cut me short: “No, your physical environment.” I remembered, with a lurch, that our apartment had been downwind from a dry cleaners. I used to go stand next to its vents because the detergent smelled great compared to the chicken slaughter plant down the street. Susie and Deb looked like they wanted to high-five. My depression had been a symptom of environmental illness. “They use all sorts of chemical agents to clean slaughterhouses,” Deb said excitedly. “When you left, did the symptoms go away?” “No, but they started to, a little, when this doctor friend of mine said to try eliminating gluten.” “The gluten, that’s what happened with me!” Susie said. “That’s one of the things I found I was sensitive to. It’s commoner than people think.” “For me, personally, it was a placebo,” I said carefully, clocking their disappointed looks. They cringed even more when I used the word “psychosomatic”. “The gluten-free thing helped for a long time, especially with the shitting my pants problem – I think just controlling my environment probably helped. But the scalp burning didn’t go away until a dermatologist prescribed me antidepressants.” “That’s not me saying the symptoms weren’t real,” I continued – and in my nervousness that I’d once again offended them, I then farted so shrilly that Mae laughed in shock. Susie just shrugged and Deb remained completely impassive, as if maybe she hadn’t heard, which was not possible. Chemicals bothered them, but bodily functions were fine. Given the progress made by discussing my medical history, I publicized my current headache. Susie scrambled to get me Tylenol, and Deb graciously explained that this was yet another sign my body was dumping toxins from the regular world. My illness had immediately elevated my status in the household. “Here you go,” Deb said, handing me a mug. Susie tapped pills into my palm. After almost 24 hours of being told I stank and generally being treated like a contagious freak, I was so grateful for these ministrations that I went to hug them. Susie acquiesced, but Deb said I was still too fragrant for us to embrace. “But I changed my mind,” she said to Mae. “I’ll let you film me, if you want.” Susie and Deb, like most of their neighbors, receive disability checks. But welfare has not made them complacent. It isn’t easy to apply for disability when you suffer from an illness that most refuse to recognize. And even if you do receive some aid, the checks could stop at any moment. All it takes is one Arizona bureaucrat looking at your file and deciding that your sickness is made up. Over and over again, residents emphasized to me that they wanted to work, they missed working – they had no identity now, they said, no sense of self worth. Many, like Deb, were former chemical engineers. They were smart, easily bored, and embarrassed by what they worried some might misconstrue as laziness, or mooching. I believed them when they said they wanted jobs. I also believed that they were far too sick to work. Many spent entire days in bed, eyes cinched against the blinding pain caused by their illness. “People here suicide themselves,” Susie said, as we trudged around the desert, collecting rocks. Our boots crunched on petrified rabbit shit. Susie told us about a friend with environmental illness who had killed himself a few months prior. “He wasn’t depressed or anything, he just couldn’t take it anymore, so he starved himself,” she said. Apparently it was common, around Snowflake, for people to kill themselves. Susie estimated that it happened around twice a year, which, given the shifting population, I pointed out as an epidemic. “We bury our own dead,” she said. “I’m so sorry,” I said. Many of the people we met had finally found doctors who believed them. Before, in the regular world, after enduring years of humiliating check-ups and stints in the emergency room, they relegated the medical profession to enemy status. Now, they spoke adoringly of their physicians, most of whom practiced integrative health – a blend of western science, holistic healing and one-on-one therapy. As long as I framed environmental illness as a physical phenomenon, Snowflakers were happy, even eager, to communicate. But they got angry if I broached their illness, even obliquely, as a psychological phenomenon. They had spent years feeling sick and battling skeptics. The last thing they wanted was to be told by an outsider, who had just met them, that they were crazy. I didn’t blame them. Later, breathing through another stomachache, I scanned my notes, rereading scrawled concerns based on various conversations about the potential that everyone we met had some form of extreme PTSD, either from being sick, witnessing a nationwide health crisis, or – as had cropped up in one or two of the conversations – from being sexually assaulted. When I asked Susie whether she took any medications for her environmental illness, she cackled, at first, like a little girl, and said, “None of your business!” “I do, though,” she continued after a pause. “For seizures.” Certain psychiatric drugs double as anti-seizure medications, so I rattled off a few familiar brand names. Susie nodded at one I took. I wondered if we had the same thing, whatever that was. On our last morning in town, Deb intercepted me in the driveway to explain how fragile I was. She had been thinking about my symptoms – the headache, my history of so-called depression and my menstrual cycle which started two weeks early on our second day there. “My therapist says it’s just stress,” I said. “I feel like maybe we recognize something in each other. We just want to call it different things.” She shook her head. “You have environmental illness, I can sense it.” In a quiet, tentative voice, she explained to me that there was, in fact, an objective, scientific way to test me for environmental illness; she could do it right then and there. The procedure would be relatively painless, but I couldn’t mention the specifics in my piece. “I feel like this will sound more ominous than it is if I leave out the details,” I said as we went through with it. “People will think we’re crazy,” she said. “I am crazy,” I said. “No,” she said. After we finished, I lingered in the doorway while Deb searched the dark house for her glasses. I was no longer permitted indoors because I had changed back into my own clothes, and the scents emanating from my regular world apparel had already caused Deb’s ears to swell, making it hard for her to hear. It was time to go, but Deb said the apparatus she used to diagnose environmental illness wasn’t working, so she would have to be in touch. I wrote down my phone number and email address. “Can I give you a hug goodbye?” I said. “Not in those clothes,” she said. As Susie ferried us back into society, beef cattle glared at us from the ditches, and calves stumbled in the road. Susie told us she didn’t see any overlap between mental and environmental illness. Certain substances were physically poisonous, and that was the end of it. “If someone is reckless or careless about exposures that will cause issues for you, that is, to some measure, assaultive,” Susie said. “Assault, that’s a strong word,” Mae said. “Yep,” Susie said. “That’s why I say it.” At the airport gate, I remembered the emergency Valium in my bag, and all of my stress went away. But it wore off on the flight, and by the time I got home, I felt the sadness in my blood. I almost hoped Deb’s test would work – that she would find something scientific to substantiate how shitty I sometimes felt. A few days later, Deb and Susie put me on speakerphone, because holding the receiver to their head triggered neurological problems. Once again, they wanted me to tell them exactly what I would write about them. They worried I might make fun of them. I told them that wasn’t my intention, but that I tended to tell the truth, at which point Deb told me that my test results had shown her that I was sick. “But I can help you.” “We can help you shave off a couple years of fruitless effort,” Susie added. “What’s wrong with me?” I said. Deb promised she would tell me, eventually. But only after she read this piece. “Isn’t that, like, blackmail?” I said. Susie and Deb started to laugh, softly and shrewdly. I’m still waiting for my results.

47,article,global-development-professionals-network/2016/jul/09/the-phrase-economic-development-has-bad-associations-in-latin-america,Working in development,2016-07-09,The phrase 'economic development' has bad associations  in Latin America,https://gu.com/p/4jca2,,The phrase 'economic development' has bad associations  in Latin America,<p>There are better ways of living; we don’t have to prioritise growth above everything else<br></p>,693,"For many of us in Latin America the phrase “economic development” is associated with – among other things – poverty, the exploitation of natural resources, environmental disasters, social discrimination, economic dependence and the criminalisation of protest. Latin America is the most unequal region in the world, with 10% of the population possessing 71% of the wealth. Environmental disasters and climate change are on the rise and, as a consequence, so is the rate of migration within and across borders. And here in Bolivia our previously protected national parks are being opened up to oil and gas drilling, potentially endangering communities, indigenous rights and precious biodiversity. In theory, economic development – created as a goal in the social imagination and promoted by our governments and privileged sectors – will bring benefits in terms of economic investment and technological advances. Agricultural, hydrocarbon, monoculture, mining and hydroelectric projects are presented as initiatives that will generate regional income, local employment and technological innovation. In reality, many economies of the region remain dependent on the export of raw materials (increasingly to China), ultimately to satisfy consumer appetites in developed countries. And we see devastating impacts from such projects, such as the collapse of the levees at the Samarco dam in Brazil last year, which released a 62 cubic metre river of toxic slurry through populated areas. Swathes of South American virgin forest have been cleared to plant GMO soya crops (pdf) for the global meat market. There are many more examples. Latin America is one of the world’s biggest regions for mining exploration and is second in the world for oil reserves. We believe it’s no coincidence that governments that have tried to resist the extraction of natural resources for the benefit of foreign interests have found themselves on the receiving end of military intervention, and been replaced by governments more willing to allow access to cheap materials and labour. Naomi Klein has written about the way that the coup which toppled Salvador Allende was quickly followed by a massive dose of ‘shock doctrine’ as state-owned industries were privatised, government spending cut and trade barriers torn down. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s pliable regimes went along with the structural adjustment policies of the Washington Consensus, designed to liberalise trade and investment. Communities in the path of extractive projects have become more determined to resist, exposing them to greater repression and criminalisation. Mining conflicts are rife across Peru, while Latin America also tops the list for the number of killings of environmental activists, with most of the murders related to mega-projects for the exploitation of raw materials. Such was the case with indigenous leader Berta Cáceres, who was shot dead after organising resistance to the proposed Agua Zarca dam. But one discourse challenging the concept of economic development in Latin America is the idea of Vivir Bien, translated (awkwardly) as “living well”. These ideas owe much to the perspectives and practices of indigenous peoples. Many such communities in Bolivia have retained community ownership of their territory as well as collective management of their resources. There are examples where access to land and basic services guaranteed by these arrangements are able to provide a bulwark against the dynamics of commercialisation and privatisation, which often lead to dispossession and generate inequalities. The concept of “living well” is not synonymous with the models of economic growth and consumerism that economic development brings about; it is becoming ever clearer that these are not true indicators of wellbeing. Economic development in its current model has not only brought more negative consequences than benefits to Latin America, it has also put the planet at risk – with the impacts of accelerating climate change particularly evident in the region, especially in Bolivia. The time has come to seek alternative ways of organising our lives that don’t reproduce colonial relations of power, inequality, submission and exploitation, and don’t assume the abuse of the marginalised and the destruction of our ecosystems as part of the natural order of things.

Of the total amount raised by Clinton, roughly $40.5 million was made on behalf of her own campaign, with an additional $28 million raised for the Democratic National Committee and state parties. Donald Trump used funds from his nonprofit Donald J Trump foundation to buy a signed Tim Tebow football helmet for $12,000 at a charity auction, in a transaction that possibly violated IRS rules against self-dealing, the Washington Post reported. Using nonprofit funds for personal use is generally illegal, although the legality of the football helmet transaction is unclear, according to three tax law experts interviewed by the Post. Loretta Lynch, the US attorney general, acknowledged on Friday that her meeting with Bill Clinton this week had “cast a shadow” over the justice department’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Lynch said she would “fully accept” whatever recommendations were made by the FBI and prosecutors, but sought to quell concerns stemming from the encounter with Bill Clinton, at an airport in Phoenix, reiterating that the justice department process for the email case remained wholly independent. Kevin Kellems, a seasoned political operative brought aboard the Trump campaign on 20 June to oversee surrogates and coordinate their messaging, abruptly resigned from the position after less than two weeks. Kellems was director of communications for former vice president Dick Cheney and worked on Newt Gingrich’s 2012 presidential campaign. In his resignation letter, quoted by the New York Times, Kellems said he has “enjoyed meeting some fine and dedicated people.” According to the conservative Daily Caller, former secretary of state and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will meet tomorrow with representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Up for discussion: the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. Citing “a source close to the investigation,” the Daily Caller reports that the interview may be conducted at Clinton’s home in Washington, DC. The interview is likely “the final step” in the FBI’s investigation. The Democratic party has released a draft of its national party platform online this afternoon. The first draft, which will be finalized at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia later this month, features a long wishlist of progressive policies, including a $15 national minimum wage, equal pay for women, a “multimillionaire surtax,” acknowledgment that the Trans-Pacific Partnership is controversial within the party and numerous other policy planks. Earlier today, Donald Trump asked a Turkish man whether he was “friend or foe” during a speech at the Western Conservative Summit in Denver, Colorado. The comments, which appeared to be in jest, were directed at a man later identified as Yusuf Serce, a journalist and columnist. One day after the first quarterly deadline since Hillary Clinton became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, the former secretary of state’s campaign has released its first fundraising numbers: $68.5 million for the month of June. “More than 1.5 million grassroots donors have stepped up to say you’re committed to stopping Donald Trump - and to breaking the highest glass ceiling in America,” Clinton’s campaign stated in a release. Of the total amount raised by Clinton, roughly $40.5 million was made on behalf of her own campaign, with an additional $28 million raised for the Democratic National Committee and state parties.

Some of the key proposals: “We believe that Americans should earn at least $15 an hour and have the right to form or join a union. We applaud the approaches taken by states like New York and California. We should raise and index the minimum wage, give all Americans the ability to join a union regardless of where they work, and create new ways for workers to have power in the economy. We also support creating one fair wage for all workers by ending the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers and people with disabilities.” “We will fight to secure equal pay for women and - after 240 years - finally enshrine the rights of women in the constitution by passing the Equal Rights Amendment. While Donald Trump thinks it is ‘dangerous’ for women to leave the home and paid family leave hurts our economy, Democrats will make sure that the United States finally enacts national paid family and medical leave by passing a family and medical leave act that would provide at least 12 weeks of paid leave to care for a new child or address a personal or family member’s serious health issue, and we will fight to allow workers the right to earn at least seven days of paid sick leave.” “Democrats will not hesitate to use and expand existing authorities as well as empower regulators to downsize or break apart financial institutions when necessary to protect the public and safeguard financial stability, including new authorities to go after risky shadow-banking activities. Banks should not be able to gamble with taxpayers’ deposits or pose an undue risk to Main Street.” “We will ask those at the top to contribute to our country’s future by establishing a multimillionaire surtax to ensure millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share.” “We will only approve new trade agreements if they support American jobs, raise wages, and improve our national security ... We should never enter into a trade agreement that prevents our government, or other governments, from putting in place rules that protect the environment, food safety, or the health of American citizens or others around the world.” “We will continue to stand up to Republican efforts to defund Planned Parenthood health centers, which provide critical health services to millions of people. We will continue to oppose - and seek to overturn - federal and state laws and policies that impede a woman’s access to abortion, including by repealing the Hyde Amendment.” “On the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), there are a diversity of views in the party. Many Democrats are on record stating that the agreement does not meet the standards set out in this platform; other Democrats have expressed support for the agreement. But all Democrats believe that any trade agreement must protect workers and the environment and not undermine access to critically-needed prescription drugs.” “We will reform mandatory minimum sentences and close private prisons and detention centers ... We will invest in training for officers on issues such as de-escalation and the appropriate use of force, and encourage better police-community relations and the use of smart strategies like police body cameras. We will end racial profiling that targets individuals, based solely on race, religion, ethnicity, and national origin, which is un-American and counterproductive.” “We reject attempts to impose a religious test to bar immigrants or refugees from entering the United States. It is un-American and runs counter to the founding principles of this country.” “Democrats support a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court’s decisions in Citizens United and Buckley v. Valeo. We need to end secret, unaccountable money in politics by requiring, through executive order or legislation, significantly more disclosure and transparency - by outside groups, federal contractors, and public corporations to their shareholders.” “Finally, Democrats will not stand for the divisive and derogatory language of Donald Trump. His offensive comments about immigrants and other communities have no place in our society. This kind of rhetoric must be rejected.” Earlier this year, the Guardian sought out Bernie Sanders supporters who said they would rather vote for Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton. Surveys at the time suggested a small proportion of Sanders fans, 7%, were willing to make such a switch. We decided to go back to 150 of the 500 or so supporters who contacted us to see if Britain’s decision to leave the European Union had made them more or less likely to favor the Republican Trump over the Democrat Clinton. Our thinking was that the economic and political turmoil caused by the success of a campaign based on nationalistic, anti-immigration sentiment led by a charismatic rightwing leader might have prompted some second thoughts. Sanders penned an op-ed for the New York Times this week urging the Democrats to bring struggling working-class disaffected voters into the party fold rather than pushing them towards Trump. So what was this group of Sanders supporters thinking, post-Brexit? About 50 responses were received. Some said they were no longer considering switching to Trump. About half backed Brexit, half opposed it. Most of those who were still switching to Trump said they saw the Brexit result as vindication of their decision to back the Republican. Except in one case, those who opposed Brexit did not feel inspired to change their voting behavior in the wake of the UK’s decision. “[The] outcome only concretes my vote for Trump, because I think in the long run it will do us good rather than harm, just like this Brexit vote,” wrote Peter Kartachian, a 34-year-old machinist from California. “These Chicken Littles who are claiming the world is ending because of this will soon be shown to be the empty suits that they are.” In at least two cases, Brexit has flipped previously unsure voters into the Trump column. One New York woman, Janet H, who asked for her surname not to be used as she didn’t want her family to know she is backing Trump, said she’d been leaning towards the Republican candidate until his racist comments about a judge of Mexican origin led her to switch, begrudgingly, to Clinton. “Then Brexit happened,” said Janet H. Yet another Republican éminence grise has come out strongly against Donald Trump’s impending presidential nomination - this time, a former chair of the Republican National Committee itself. Marc Racicot, a former governor of Montana and chair of the RNC, has published an editorial in the Washington Post calling on “a second miracle in Cleveland” to prevent Trump’s accession to the party’s nomination, writing that the real estate mogul has “neither the aforementioned qualities of principled leadership, nor offered any substantive or serious conservative policy proposals” to merit the position. “After long and careful consideration, I cannot endorse or support [the voters’] decision to express their frustration, anger and disappointment by selecting Trump as the Republican nominee for president,” Racicot wrote. Trump, he said, has failed to demonstrate, among other things, “persistent seriousness, solemn and honest commitment to the interests of others, exhaustive study and detailed proposals, sincerity, humility, empathy, dignity, fairness, patience, genuine respect for all of God’s children, durability, modesty and the absence of self-interest.” In addition, Racicot continued, Trump’s inconsistency with the Republican platform on a myriad of issues make him unsuitable for the nomination. “Both, in my humble view, are indispensable preconditions to his selection as the Republican candidate for the office of president of the United States,” Racicot wrote. “As a result, I cannot endorse or support Trump for president.” Eternal presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is using his vast email listserv to warn his supporters about labels on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in US food, kicking off with an email titled simply “Monsanto.” “The corporate interests are at it again,” Sanders wrote. “Monsanto, agribusiness and the bio-tech industry have spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to overturn legislation passed by Vermont, Connecticut, Maine and Alaska that calls for the labeling of GMO food. In fact, they are moving aggressively now because Vermont’s strong law goes into effect today.” “This legislation is important because people have a right to know what is in the food they and their children eat. The more information we have, the better consumers we become. This is not a radical idea. It is why over 60 countries around the world have passed GMO labeling laws.” Most scientific reports have indicated that GMOs are generally safe, both to humans and the environment, although Sanders has dismissed studies showing this as either too short-sighted or financially backed by agribusiness interests. House minority leader Nancy Pelosi released a statement this afternoon condemning the decision by House Republicans to hold a vote on an amendment, rejected by the Senate, that fails to close what her office characterized as “the terrorist gun loophole”: “All across America, families are demanding real action to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and suspected terrorists, not a toothless NRA bill that will do nothing to keep our communities safe,” Pelosi stated. “The American people cannot understand why Republicans want it to be easier for a suspected terrorist to buy a lethal weapon than to set foot on a plane. If you’re too dangerous to fly in America, you’re too dangerous to buy a gun in America – simple as that. But a month after the worst mass shooting in American history, House Republicans are once again putting the NRA ahead of their responsibility to keep the American people safe.” Pelosi called the motion, submitted by Texas senator John Cornyn, “just the latest evidence that House Republicans have become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the NRA.” At the risk of overusing the term “shade...” According to the conservative Daily Caller, former secretary of state and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will meet tomorrow with representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Up for discussion: the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state. Citing “a source close to the investigation,” the Daily Caller reports that the interview may be conducted at Clinton’s home in Washington, DC. The interview is likely “the final step” in the FBI’s investigation. Federal officials have already interviewed top Clinton aides, including Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin. It’s not known when the investigation will conclude. James Comey, the FBI’s director, has repeatedly said that there is no specific timeline for wrapping it up. Maria La Ganga is inside the Western conservative summit for the Guardian – and reports that the amazing crowd Trump has been boasting about from the stage is actually quite sparse: Trump is claiming credit for Nato developing an anti-terrorism unit. “I’m not saying I’m an expert on Nato. Nobody ever asked me about Nato before. But I have a lot of common sense, and a lot of business sense.” Trump has called Nato obsolete. He says he did not mean abandon it. He said he might have meant fix it. “It’s a different world. I see things that a lot of people don’t.” Trump is on to the Bill Clinton - Loretta Lynch meeting. He questions whether the meeting was a coincidence and casts doubt on Lynch’s description of the conversation, which she said was about CLinton’s grandkids and golf. Trump also drops a little news: all of his children and his wife will be speaking at the Republican convention. “You see what happened where Bill Clinton goes into an airplane. He just happened to be at the airport,” Trump says. “It’s not a joke. It’s a serious thing... As you know, Hillary is so guilty... how that’s not being pursued properly. I think he really opened it up. He opened up a Pandora’s Box and it shows what’s going on with our laws, with our government.” Trump doubts Clinton’s presence at the airport was coincidental. And he wants to know how Lynch and Clinton spent their time together – it’s unknown how long they met for but it’s been described as a half-hour – what did they talk about? Trump says he loves his grandchildren, “but if I talk about them for more than about nine or ten seconds ... after that, what are you gonna say, right? I love em. I love my children. My children are going to speaking at the convention... Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, Don... my wife is gonna be speaking at the convention. “I love golf. But after talking about it for a couple of minutes, it’s hard to talk about it.” “We’re going to have job loss like you’ve never seen, ever before, if I don’t win.” – Donald Trump Then Trump says he will expand the electoral map, by winning Ohio and Pennsylvania, but also, “we may even have a shot at New York and California” because “we have tremendous crowds” in those places. “I think that we have a lot more leeway than anyone else running from the Republican party,” Trump says. Everything he just said flies in the face of everything the polls are indicating. A Siena College poll in New York published Thursday depicted Clinton up 23 points on Trump in the state. But the polls could all be wrong. This is true. Trump is talking about repealing and replacing Obamacare. “I already talked about the fact that we’re going to save the second amendment, right? That’s a biggie.” Trump says he’ll eliminate regulations, lower taxes and simplify the tax code. “Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes – we’re lowering your taxes big league,” he says. Or was that “bigly”? We definitely heard “big league” that time, after most always hearing “bigly”. Trump begins: “Oh if I’d have known they had these TelePrompters I would’ve used them.” He jokes that he’s getting used to the TelePrompters and he likes them. “This is a tremendous crowd and we really appreciate it,” he says. Trump begins by talking about the delegates selection process in Colorado, where delegates were elected at a state convention dominated by Ted Cruz. “All of a sudden I didn’t get the delegates,” he says. “The system’s rigged. It’s rigged. It’s rigged against the people.” Trump quotes Fox host Bill O’Reilly as saying that his political movement is the “single greatest phenomena” that O’Reilly has seen in his lifetime. Trump is now taking the stage. Here’s that live stream again: After his speech, Trump will attend a private fundraiser hosted by beer magnate Pete Coors and former NFL coach Mike Shanahan. Here’s a snippet of the Palin speech. She said something about the ‘splodey heads keep sploding’: It’s a lively scene outside the Colorado convention center, where Trump is scheduled to speak imminently: At Trump’s Manchester, New Hampshire, event Thursday afternoon, an attendee asked him about hiring military veterans to work for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), saying “why aren’t we putting our military retirees ... in TSA? Get rid of all these heebeejabis they wear at TSA, I’ve seen them myself. We need the veterans back in there. “You know, and wee are looking at that,” Trump says. “We’re looking at a lot of things”. Trump is late to the conservative summit in Denver. But they say that it’s been confirmed that he has landed. Donald Trump will meet at the weekend with Indiana governor Mike Pence, whose name has been floated as a potential Trump running mate. Pence is also up for reelection however, and the state party would have to submit a name to replace him – should he develop other plans – by 15 July. The Trump campaign acknowledged the planned meeting in a statement from communications advisor Jason Miller: Mr. Trump is meeting with a number of Republican leaders in the run-up to the convention in Cleveland, and he has a good relationship with Gov. Pence.” Update: This post has been corrected. An earlier version stated that the Trump-Pence meeting had already taken place. Kevin Kellems, a seasoned political operative brought aboard the Trump campaign on 20 June to oversee surrogates and coordinate their messaging, has abruptly resigned after less than two weeks. Kellems was director of communications for former vice president Dick Cheney and worked on New Gingrich’s 2012 presidential campaign. In his resignation letter, quoted by the New York Times, Kellems says he has “enjoyed meeting some fine and dedicated people.” While brief, it has been an interesting experience, and am proud of the contributions made through our early-phase project endeavors. Also have enjoyed meeting some fine and dedicated individuals throughout the organization. Look forward to running across several of you going forward. On Thursday, the Trump campaign parted ways with digital consultant Vincent Harris, a former employee of Rand Paul’s presidential campaign, on the same week they hired him, the Times separately reported. Palin’s stream-of-consciousness riff, her spontaneous spoken, prose poem is true to form: Together, we call em out. We call out the liars, cuz we’re gonna make America great again. And this movement is exactly that... Trump is with us in withholding the oath, swearing to uphold what it is .. declarations of liberty... existential threats that others would ignore. The biggest most sinister threat, it’s Islamic ideology, that is Isis, that is the death cult that isn’t even acknowledged with actual verbage with leftists, with their heads in the sand... Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor, is addressing the Western conservative summit in Denver, Colorado, where Trump is due to speak shortly. There’s a live stream on local NBC News. She’s currently talking about the assault on the second amendment. And transitions to praise for Trump: “Ask yourself, what have his critics ever built?” Update: here’s a live video stream: Here’s a light moment from Lynch’s appearance. What did her predecessor, Eric Holder, omit to mention about the job? How to lock the plane, she replies: Here’s a good follow-up question for Lynch: will the recommendations from the emails inquiry be filtered through other political appointees, before she approves them as anticipated? “It’s painful to me because the work of the department of justice is important,” Lynch says of l’affaire Bill Clinton. “To the extent that this issue has overshadowed that mission, yes, that’s painful to me.” She says she wants to provide as much information as possible so people have faith in the department of justice. When will the investigation wrap? she’s asked. Lynch answers the question with some insight into the large scope of the investigation into Clinton’s emails: I actually don’t know that. I don’t have that insight into the nuts and bolts... they’re working on it to make sure they’re as thorough as they can be, to look at it from every angle, to cover every issue.” Now they switch to community policing. Lynch recounts the Clinton meeting: “He said hello, and we basically said hello. And I congratulated him on his conversation... and that led to a conversation about his travels... and then we spoke about former AG Janet Reno. “But it really was a social meeting. It really was in that regard... “I do think that no matter how I viewed it, I understand how people view it. “It’s cast a shadow over how this case is resolved,” Lynch says, although in fact the meeting “does not have a bearing on how this matter is reviewed...and resolved by me.” “What’s important to me is, how do people view the department of justice because of that meeting?.. I felt that it’s important to talk about what impact that meeting will have on the case, which it won’t,” she says. Does she regret not kicking Clinton off the plane? “The issue is how does it impact the work that I do... I certainly wouldn’t do it again. “It has cast a shadow over what it should not. Over what it will not touch.” Jonathan Capehart of the Washington Post is interviewing Lynch. Lynch tells him she expects to accept the recommendation of the team investigating the Clinton emails matter. She goes on to say the recommendation will be contained in a “final report” produced by the team, seeming to foreclose on the possibility of her altering or opposing the recommendation. “I will be accepting their recommendations, and their plan for going forward,” she says. She says the decision had been made before Bill Clinton boarded her plane on Monday. The Clinton meeting “has raised concerns, I feel. While I can certainly say... I think people need the information in how that resolution will come about,” she says. The first question: what happened in Phoenix? What on Earth were you thinking? Lynch says it’s “a perfectly reasonable question”. “People have wondered... about my role in the ultimate resolution in matters involving the investigation... certainly my meeting with him raises questions and concerns...” She says it’s a valid question. “Let me be clear... as I’ve always indicated the matter’s being handled by career... investigators... it predates my tenure as AG... it is the same team. That team will make findings... they will make recommendations... [to be] reviewed by the FBI” and the FBI director. “They present it to me and I fully expect to accept the recommendations,” she says. It’s not a recusal, she says, because she expects to be briefed on the findings, “and I will be accepting their recommendations.” But will she make her own determination? “No, the final determination as to how to proceed, will be contained within the final format of the report.” “This case will be resolved by the team that’s been working on it from the beginning... the FBI will review it... and that will be the finalization of factual findings and the next steps in this matter.” Lynch is about to speak. The assigned topic of conversation is community policing. She’s expected to address the Clinton emails controversy and may speak about her meeting with Bill Clinton on Monday. Here’s the live stream: Donald Trump visited Capitol Hill in October 1993 to testify before the Native American affairs subcommittee about casino licenses for Native American tribes, who should get them – and how you can tell who’s who. “They don’t look like Indians to me,” Trump says. Watch here: While we wait for the attorney general – for a catchup on the emails controversy, we refer you to Guardian Washington correspondent David Smith’s piece from earlier this month, Could Hillary Clinton really be indicted over her emails? Here’s the top: Did Hillary Clinton do the wrong thing when she used a private email server while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013? Yes. She herself has admitted that it was a mistake. A recent report by the state department inspector general found that she broke multiple rules despite repeated warnings to use official communications methods that would ensure her emails were stored and kept safe from hackers. Did she break the law? As an FBI investigation continues, expert opinion is divided. Some offer a view reminiscent of Bill Clinton’s famous remark that he experimented with marijuana but “didn’t inhale”. “I believe Clinton did break the law but at the same time I don’t think there’s evidence she committed a crime,” says Douglas Cox, associate professor at City University of New York School of Law. It is a violation of federal records law to remove or destroy material, Cox notes, although Clinton “in part” fixed this by returning thousands of emails. More important in assessing whether a crime was committed is the question of intent, Cox says. “While there were warnings and memos that she should have been aware of, from a prosecution side they would need to prove her knowledge and intent and have evidence of that to bring before a jury.” Cox believes such evidence is lacking. In this sense the case is different from those of retired general David Petraeus, former director of the CIA, and Sandy Berger, ex-national security adviser, both of whom handled information they knew was classified and were wilfully deceitful. But a minority disagree with this analysis. Read the full piece here: A man appears at the Lynch event and says she has arrived but “the session will begin slightly delayed.” Lynch is scheduled to appear any moment at the Aspen Ideas Festival. Here’s a live video feed: Attorney general Loretta Lynch is expected to speak to reporters about the Clinton email affair, and possibly her impromptu (?) meeting Monday with Bill Clinton, in about 20 minutes. Offers to donate millions that turn out to be empty promises... it rings a bell somehow... More Trump Super Pac woes (further to Peter Stone’s reporting we mentioned in the introductory post): rival Trump Super Pacs (outside groups that can raise and spend unlimited money but cannot legally coordinate with the campaign) are at war to attract the big-fish donors – but even Pacs with millions in commitments are having trouble actually collecting money people said they’d give. Yahoo’s Michael Isikoff reports on the Pac donation-collection problem: “So far, the pro-Trump super-PACs have banked only a small fraction of the tens of millions of dollars they had been promised by big contributors, sources familiar with the groups’ fundraising operations tell Yahoo News”: In early June, private equity mogul Thomas Barrack got big headlines when he told CNN that he had lined up $32 million in pledged contributions to Rebuilding America Now, a super-PAC he helped establish to promote Trump’s candidacy. [...] But Rebulding America Now has collected only $2 million of those pledges — from a single donor — Laurance Gay, the managing director of Rebuilding America Now, confirmed to Yahoo News The LA Times reports on the tangle of Super Pacs fighting for supremacy in the rather meager world of pro-Trump fundraising: ...wealthy contributors wishing to invest in the pro-Trump effort are facing an odd assortment of super PACs with competing visions, questionable capacity and sometimes sketchy track records. According to election finance reports, of the dozen or so pro-Trump super PACs established so far, only a few have reported raising significant amounts of money or interest — for a total of about $4 million as of the end of May. And most of that has already been spent. Donald Trump used funds from his nonprofit Donald J Trump foundation to buy a signed Tim Tebow football helmet for $12,000 at a charity auction, in a transaction that possibly violated IRS rules against self-dealing, the Washington Post reports. Using nonprofit funds for personal use is generally illegal, although the legality of the football helmet transaction is unclear, according to three tax law experts interviewed by the Post. Trump got in a bidding war for the helmet at an auction to benefit the Susan G Komen breast cancer nonprofit. He won. But instead of writing a personal check for the helmet, he sent money from his foundation, which is mostly, according to the Washington Post’s reporting, other people’s money, donated with the intention of contributing to charity, not buying Trump helmets. Trump had not made a personal donation to his foundation for at least three years before he bought the helmet, the Post reported. Hello and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House. Donald Trump this morning is aggressively attacking Hillary Clinton over a meeting Monday on a Phoenix tarmac between Bill Clinton and attorney general Loretta Lynch. Lynch told reporters Wednesday that it was a chance meeting restricted to small talk. Trump, however, detects a conspiracy, conceived by the Clintons, to smooth Hillary Clinton’s way to the presidency by arranging for a secret meeting between Bill Clinton and the head of a justice department currently investigating Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email account and server during her time as secretary of state. Under pressure from the furor over the secret meeting, Lynch plans to announce Friday that she will in effect recuse herself from the case and accept whatever recommendation career prosecutors and federal agents make in the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, a justice department official told the Associated Press on Friday. Trump’s not wholly reassured. “Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?” he tweets. Here’s how Lynch described the encounter at a news conference in Los Angeles Wednesday scheduled to discuss community policing: He did come over and say hello, and speak to my husband and myself, and talk about his grandchildren and his travels and things like that. That was the extent of that. And no discussions were held into any cases or things like that. The tempest, however, is already out of the teapot: In non-Clinton-conspiracy news, the veepstakes have not necessarily been reduced, on the Republican side, to former House speaker Newt Gingrich and New Jersey governor Chris Christie – but the two men are being seriously vetted as potential Trump running mates, according to many reports. MSNBC has this coverage this morning: Trump faces a significant fundraising deficit both inside his campaign and among the outside political groups that would support his candidacy. Potential and past donors retain reservations about the candidate, several told Peter Stone for the Guardian: Several donors backing Trump told the Guardian that the candidate’s errors are piling up. “He’s got to learn not to put his foot in his mouth,” said Stan Hubbard, a billionaire broadcaster who has donated $100,000 to the pro-Trump Great America Pac. “He needs a clearer message without name-calling.” Hubbard also called Trump’s recent trip to Scotland – where he was criticized for hailing the plunge in the pound post-Brexit as good for his golf course there – a mistake. “He should have let his kids do it.” Likewise, potential Super Pac donors say Trump badly needs to curb his bombastic rhetoric and craft a better message. Michael Epstein, who raised big money for Wisconsin governor Scott Walker and plans to vote for Trump but also “hold my nose and pray”, said that he might back a Super Pac if Trump has a strong GOP convention next month and really “turns it around”. But Epstein added: “I’m less and less hopeful. He can’t get out of his own way. He’s going to have to demonstrate more presidential behavior, They’re behind the eight ball and they’ve got to move fast.” Read further: At a campaign event in Manchester, New Hampshire, on Thursday, Trump joked that an airplane flying overhead was a Mexican attack: Thank you for reading and please join us in the comments.",https://media.guim.co.uk/3e4ee7fde36b19a3d015bc2279c4799d1bd67a07/0_267_4000_2400/500.jpg,0.08944108385813726
49,article,lifeandstyle/2016/jun/23/magnus-nilsson-faviken-sweden,Food,2016-06-23,Magic out of mould: inside the world’s wildest restaurant | Jordan Kisner,https://gu.com/p/4me84,Lifestyle,Magic out of mould: inside the world’s wildest restaurant,"<p>In an age when chefs are regularly compared to artists and philosophers, Magnus Nilsson is among the world’s most renowned. But is the simple act of cooking ever worthy of such veneration?</p>",5685,"Magnus Nilsson, the 32-year-old chef at Fäviken, Sweden’s premier fine-dining restaurant, is not fond of repeating himself, but there is one sentence he repeats with such frequency and resolute force that it takes on the quality of a koan: “Do it once, perfectly.” He says it when observing that one of his chefs has failed to place the dollop of burnt cream in the same place on every dish, or when explaining why he paid so much for his elaborate recycling and composting facility, which has reduced the restaurant’s waste to practically nothing. This, too, was the guiding principle behind his most recent book, an encyclopedic record of the past several hundred years of Nordic home cooking comprising 730 recipes, including about 30 that Nilsson expects no one ever to cook. (“That is not the point,” he explained. “It is a documentary.”) When the publisher tried to strike one recipe from the collection because it was both impractical and, they feared, controversial (it included whale meat), Nilsson offered to return his advance and put the manuscript in a drawer, rather than publish it incomplete. He explained his reasoning with an amused shrug: “Do it correctly or do not do it.” One of the central theses of The Nordic Cookbook is that a country’s dinner table reveals a great deal about its culture’s values, economy, landscape, religions, politics, and even family structure. This idea is not original to Nilsson, but the Nordic Cookbook is the most exhaustive recent attempt to catalogue a segment of the world through its food. To compile it, Nilsson amassed 11,000 articles and 8,000 photographs, interviewed hundreds of people, and travelled to the farthest reaches of the region, from Sami country to the Faroe Islands. He did this in his spare time. Nilsson’s day job, however, is running Fäviken. Set 375 miles north of Stockholm, deep in the forested province of Jämtland, Fäviken’s 32-course tasting menu demands a journey: an hour’s flight from Stockholm to Östersund, then a 75-minute drive north-west. Nilsson is quick to point out that the flight from Stockholm actually makes Fäviken relatively low-fuss in terms of destination dining – nevertheless, the restaurant is positioned like the prize at the end of a quest. Its setting is, especially to non-Swedes, otherworldly. In Jämtland, timberlands and mountain vistas unfold and unfold with little human interruption. There are only three people per square mile. At the height of summer, the sun shines for 24 hours a day. In the winter, the temperature drops to -40C. Reindeer wander the woods. As a home for a fine-dining restaurant, it is an odd choice, yet Nilsson’s embrace of this landscape has set him apart as one of the most important, innovative chefs working today. In the eight years since its opening, Fäviken has become a pillar of the “new Nordic” trend in food culture alongside René Redzepi’s Copenhagen restaurant, Noma. Like Redzepi, Nilsson is a forager – he is also a hunter and expert gardener – and much of his food is designed to bring you into some sort of encounter with its origin. One of his signature dishes is a single scallop poached in its own juices, which arrives at your table in its gigantic shell atop a bed of moss and burning juniper branches cut from behind the kitchen – the ocean meeting the forest. Food as an exercise in high aesthetics has been part of popular culture since the Spanish chef Ferran Adrià brought his restaurant, El Bulli, and its pioneering molecular gastronomy “lab” to international fame in the late 1990s. But Fäviken is at the vanguard of restaurants whose food is also talked about as an expression of moral values. This comes, in part, from Nilsson’s commitment to regional and local sourcing: he cooks almost exclusively with ingredients that can be bought within a few hundred miles. His chefs forage moss, herbs, grasses, mushrooms, flowers and seeds from the grounds every day, and about half the produce for the restaurant is grown in their garden. During the long winter months, when the sun only breaks the horizon line for an hour or two each day and the land is sheathed in snow and ice, the kitchen serves mostly foods they have harvested and foraged in the warm months and then preserved. With his pickled hand-picked carrots and dried cloudberries, Nilsson is the man millions of aspiring locavores wish to be. The food isn’t just appealingly local; it’s a seemingly “authentic” expression of a place. All the ingredients have a story, which you hear before each course, and the meal made from them is an edible heirloom. Nilsson’s preparations draw on hundreds of years of regional food culture, which has naturally adapted to accommodate the environment’s extremes: the caramel for a tart is made with brunost, a sweet, fatty Norwegian cheese, and the bitter herb sauce served alongside it comes from techniques and ingredients of the native Sami people. The chocolate-like disc melting under your cut of meat comes from the wildflowers that overtake the mountains in the summer. Nilsson has been showered with accolades and attention: rave reviews, multi-hour documentary series from PBS and Netflix, liberal use of the word “wunderkind”. A season’s worth of reservations in Fäviken’s 24-seat dining room sell out in minutes. His food is not popular, exactly – it has been deemed important cultural material. (Nilsson himself recently referred to his food as “intellectual property” in a speech to his staff.) People have started restaurants with similar philosophies as a kind of homage. Google has invited him to give presentations at their headquarters. Diners flock from every country in the world. One recent guest in Fäviken’s dining room told me that he and his wife were not there just for the food. “We think of him [Nilsson] more as a philosopher or poet than a chef,” he said. If our dinner plates reveal who we are, what does Nilsson’s rise to fame say about our fantasies and obsessions? The vast majority of people fascinated with Nilsson will never visit Fäviken, so they follow along at home, watching him on TV or checking his Instagram, which recently featured a picture of what appeared to be two mouldy pellets of Frosted Wheat. It was mycelium growing on a bale of straw, the caption explained, “waiting to be turned into broth before being served with a small lump of cultured butter”. That nearly no one knows what mycelium is (it’s a fungus) doesn’t bother his followers – the thrill seems to be that somewhere in an imagined wilderness, a hunter-chef is cooking it perfectly. This is our contemporary fairytale: a Swede making magic out of mould. * * * My introduction to the Fäviken kitchen was this: I watched two men spend several hours auditioning asparagus. It wasn’t clear at first what they were doing. One would pick up a green stalk from the 10 that had been selected and turn it over in his hands gently, considering how best to peel it. Then the other would pick a stalk up and frown at it. After a while, one of the men, Nilsson’s chef de cuisine, a young Italian named Jakob Zeller, picked up a small paring knife and with meditative care traced a light cut around the circumference of the stalk, just below the crown. He then placed the asparagus back down on the cutting board and, taking up a traditional vegetable peeler, made delicate strokes from the incision to the base of the stalk. A haystack of asparagus wisp collected on his board. Next to him, the sous chef, a Swede named Neil Byrne, tested ways to remove another stalk’s buds, hoping to make it look as though they had not been removed at all but that the restaurant had found magical asparagus that never had them to begin with. It took these men 35 minutes to peel three stalks. It was mid-May, and Fäviken was coming to the end of its eight-week yearly hiatus. The period of rest meant that the staff needed to retrain to execute the 32-course meal served at the restaurant. There were only three days until a trial run for family and friends, and four days until paying customers arrived. The Fäviken team was deep in rehearsal mode, deciding the final details of dishes being introduced in the new season, memorising their responsibilities, and learning how to do every job perfectly. On one side of the kitchen, an older sous chef trained a younger chef on the meat station, reminding him to consider the four seconds it takes to cross the room from the stove to the plate when planning cooking time. Nilsson’s head chef, a tall, rosy-cheeked Swede named Jesper Karlsson, had two apprentices practising arranging trays, memorising the positioning and shape of the plates for each course. Over in the corner, the new chef in charge of vegetables had been cutting the same stalk of rhubarb for an hour, perfecting his technique for a garnish that would accompany a braised lamb’s tongue. The chefs’ workspace is perhaps the most beautiful room at Fäviken, bright and calm, with white tiled walls and stainless steel worktops, appliances and cabinets. A large coal brazier stands in the middle of the room. Sunlight pours in through wide, gridded windows. The entire kitchen, from its floors to its hardware, is immaculate. The traditional ruckus and raised voices of the professional kitchen are absent. The chefs, dressed in white double-breasted jackets and pert caps, tread lightly, never clatter their implements, and speak to each other in soft, accented English. After several attempts, Zeller and Byrne peeled an asparagus satisfactorily enough to consider cooking it. Zeller reached for a plate and arranged the stalk in the middle – in its final form, the plate would hold only one stalk and a scoop of caviar. Zeller placed the model before Byrne. They took a step back and each assumed a thoughtful pose: arms crossed, eyes narrowed. Zeller cocked his head to one side and Byrne cocked his to the other. Finally, Byrne shrugged. “Yeah, it’s OK,” said Jakob, agreeably if not enthusiastically. The asparagus was sent to the steam oven for four minutes. Just then, Nilsson entered the kitchen without a word and walked over to a cut of beef sitting on the counter waiting to be prepped. (Nilsson wears his hair shoulder-length and loose, and he is the only person in the kitchen who never wears a hat.) He lowered his nose to a half-inch above the meat, nodded, and then watched as the asparagus came out of the steaming oven. He stared at the vegetable for a few moments, made a few deft slices and popped a chunk in his mouth. Nilsson and Zeller compared notes: even with the lightest touch, the peeler had stripped too much off the stalk, but how to get less than that? Nilsson disappeared to the dishwashing station and returned with a clean sponge. He took a raw stalk from the bin and gently scrubbed it down. “Ah, OK,” said Jakob, nodding and grinning. They would have to order more sponges. Two hours later, the asparagus preparation had been decided on and it was time to complete full rehearsal of another dish: a cut of beef served over a thin disc of “chocolate” made from lupin beans. The sous chefs set all the component parts on the pass – the area where dishes are assembled before being sent to the diners – and the entire staff gathered around in silence to watch Nilsson model how this course would be composed on the plate. The plating, with its fastidious preparations, varied implements and tiny dishes, was carried out with the hush of a surgical procedure. Nilsson turned on an overhead lamp and then leaned over the dish with his brow furrowed. He dipped a brush in softened butter. “Where is the salt?” he asked. Three young chefs lurched across the kitchen. Eventually, he stood up, and the staff leaned in to look. “It looks a bit on the dry side,” Nilsson said to Peeter Pihel, the elder sous chef of the meat station. He waited for the younger chefs to take pictures for later study before slicing the meat and taking a bite, gesturing for his head chefs to follow. “Add some chives,” Nilsson said. “The meat has been hanging too long over here. It is maybe a little bit over-rested.” Everyone chewed pensively. “Yeah,” he pronounced. “Very good.” He crossed the kitchen to hand me a hunk and explained: “It has been hanging too long in our aging area, so it’s too close in texture to charcuterie.” The meat tasted rich and vibrant and unfamiliar. “Did you marinate it?” I asked. “No, it’s just butter and salt,” he replied. “But it’s a dairy cow, which is much older than the beef anyone else cooks with and it’s more difficult to cook because it’s leaner and there’s more connective tissue to break down. But if you cook it properly, it is very good.” “So that’s just the flavour of the meat itself?” He smiled, pleased. “That is what beef is supposed to taste like.” * * * Rehearsals continued through the end of the week. Monday would bring the trial for friends and family. Hatim Zubair, the formal, natty Canadian front-of-house manager, led three young women servers through the elaborate process of greeting guests. One server would stand on a little bench, looking out for approaching guests from the room’s one, high window, and announcing when someone was approximately 15 feet away so that Zubair could sweep open the door, as if by magic, right as they reached the threshold. Guests would then be ushered to the bar for champagne and cured meats. Together, the staff practised their routines multiple times for imaginary guests. The repetitions continued in the kitchen as well with final tests of the lamb’s tongue, which was new to the menu. The tongue was to be served whole, braised slowly according to a method Nilsson found in a Swedish cookbook from 1768, and garnished with brined dandelion and slivers of rhubarb. In the same manner as before, the chefs gathered around Nilsson as he assembled the plate, arranging the dandelions in three shambling piles over the curving tongue. “The rhubarb is too thick,” he observed, glancing at the chef de partie responsible for vegetables. He then poured a bright green sauce around the base and placed a few thin discs of rhubarb over the top. Nilsson and Zeller watched as the three younger chefs, who would be in charge of plating this course in the dining room, attempted to emulate his work. “Don’t pour the sauce on the whole thing, then there’s no contrast while eating,” said Nilsson. “And don’t have all the dandelion pointing in the same direction as the tongue because it will look boring,” added Zeller. The apprentices took more dandelions and tried arranging the dandelion over and over. “No, see yours does not look like mine,” Nilsson said. “See how mine began in three piles and then connected it a bit? Yours is just spread out.” They did it again. “You are taking too long,” Nilsson said mildly. “It should be very quick.” Upstairs, two different chefs were debating the perfect angle for the pot handle during service of a burbot fish stew. At first, it is difficult to see why Nilsson’s meal requires such preparation and repetition, but once you grasp the magnitude of the undertaking, a few days of rehearsal seems barely sufficient. The meal at Fäviken can vary from 29 to 33 courses, each with two to six component parts that need to be prepared à la minute. “Most kitchens prepare in advance and then they assemble in the moment,” Nilsson explained. “We cook right up until the moment.” For that many courses to feel palatable or interesting to a diner, their pacing needs to be varied and strict. “What fills people up is time,” Magnus said. “You can eat lots in 45 minutes, but if you spread the same amount of food out over four hours, you feel tired and full. If we do it right, they will eat everything.” The kitchen is guided by a giant digital clock blinking each second in fluorescent red. The first seven courses, such as the linseed vinegar dip with mussel sauce, emerge from the kitchen every 100 to 120 seconds. After a pause, the larger dishes begin: burbot stew, the famous scallop, the lamb’s tongue, and several others, which arrive every six minutes or so, until the pace accelerates again to about once a minute through to the brown cheese pie. The pace picks up and slows down like this until the end of the night. Every part of the evening is choreographed. The dining room occupies the second floor of an old barn, and to get to it, you ascend steep wooden stairs with no railing, past a full-length fur coat installed on the wall. Aging joints of meat hang from the wall, near to an enormous harness for unidentified livestock. The look is spartan-luxe, as if designed for a big man by another big man, which makes the pops of delicacy – the long stems on the wine glasses, the narrow vases of wild herbs – striking. Pinspot lamps are tucked discreetly in the rafters, shining tightly on the prettiest and most rustic pieces of decor. Like the food, the room is crafted to feel sylvan and wild, somehow more essential and real than your own life. It is theatre, but when it’s working you don’t care. * * * There is something faintly absurd about all this, which is exactly what makes it appealing to so many people. One of the premises that has elevated Nilsson’s work to international acclaim is that food is art and therefore deserving of painstaking care, auteurship, intellectualisation, and occasional worship. To some, this truth seems evident, but it is hardly a given – for hundreds of years, food had no such place in culture. (And, of course, even now only the privileged can afford to engage with it this way.) Writing for the New York Times in 2012, the critic William Deresiewicz issued a corrective: Both food and art, “begin by addressing the senses, but that is where food stops … an apple is not a story, even if we can tell a story about it. A curry is not an idea, even if its creation is the result of one.” One of Nilsson’s charms is that he acknowledges that his level of care and craftsmanship is extreme (“ridiculous, if you think of food as fuel”) while still making it seem like a reasonable, desirable, even practical approach. Though he is a tall and substantial man, Nilsson’s round, pink cheeks and winning smile emphasise his other boyish qualities: enthusiasm, curiosity, cheerful amiability, impatience. “You can see the shining in his eye if he is happy,” Zeller told me. “And the other way around as well.” Nilsson grew up in the nearby city of Östersund and it seems as though his ambitions for food were always titanic. When he was 15, he wrote himself a letter planning out the next 20 years of his life and promising that he would run the best restaurant in the world. He left home that year to go to cooking school in Åre, the ski resort town just over the mountain from Fäviken. After school, he moved to Paris and took a position at l’Astrance, a small Michelin-starred restaurant run by Pascal Barbot. He spent three years there, and then returned to Sweden, where he became so frustrated with the limited selection of produce and the feeling that he could not capture an original point of view with his food that he quit cooking altogether. He enrolled in sommelier school, thinking he might write about wine. Through local connections, he met the owners of the Fäviken property, who asked him to come and organise their wine collection. Gradually, he found his way into the kitchen, and in 2008, he took over officially, revamping what had been a small moose-and-potatoes restaurant into a stranger, more ambitious project. Nilsson’s mind is connective, kinetic, multi-track. He once, in the kitchen, interrupted his own rapid-fire corrections of the five things going wrong with a course to ask whether I had noticed the pair of reindeer grazing at the edge of the woods, a thousand yards out the window. He talks with equal ease and interest about butchery, American regionalism, book publishing, the economics of dairy production, the history of Swedish socialism and the molecular life cycle of a raspberry. In his spare time, he likes to invent new ingredients or new ways of preparing food. One summer, he became fixated on making soft-serve ice cream. How to use only natural ingredients – milk, eggs, etc – and still get the texture? He figured out that the problem was that most soft-serve machines come preprogrammed to settings that would ruin natural custard, so he found a highly specialised machine from Japan, flew it over, and tested ingredients and settings several dozen times until he had the perfect, soft vanilla. These experiments are primarily a way to keep himself entertained. They also, often, come from a sense that the status quo can – and therefore should – be improved upon. This was the impetus for Nilsson’s biggest extracurricular project: his charcuterie company, Undersåkers Charkuteriefabrik. Several years ago, Nilsson learned that the only pig farm in the area, which had been owned by the same family for generations, was bankrupt and set to close. He brokered an arrangement: Fäviken would buy the pig farmer’s entire annual output, purchase and convert a charcuterie factory 20 minutes away from the restaurant, and begin industrial manufacturing of cured meats to be distributed to grocery stores all over the country. “The idea was to make everyday charcuterie that was just better than other everyday charcuterie,” said Nilsson. They would also open a roving hot dog truck, the Korvkiosk, which would drive around Stockholm selling Swedish hot dogs known as korv and, because it pleased Nilsson, soft-serve ice cream. As we walked through the factory one afternoon, Nilsson exuded excitement and conviction. He is the only chef of his calibre doing this kind of mass food production, and he is quick to acknowledge that fine dining does not prepare you for commercial production. So why do it? It couldn’t be to build a brand: neither Nilsson nor Fäviken are mentioned anywhere on the packaging or marketing materials. The answer combines Nilsson’s brand of idealism and intense practicality. For one thing, he wants to counteract the exodus of people leaving Jämtland in search of work. “I think it should be possible to live in these parts of the world, the rural parts,” he said. “Also I don’t think that there is any benefit to producing most foods for consumption somewhere else and shipping them back. It doesn’t make sense to me.” Unlike many chefs, he is uninterested in opening more and more restaurants. “But I like doing this,” he said, facing the factory in front of us. “I would like to do more of this. The best way of pushing [the world] in a direction that you want is to make the change yourself rather than go to food conferences and make little statements that people don’t really care about.” A relentless commitment to the idea that the right choice is also practical in the long run is the hallmark of how Nilsson works. If you can increase the creative productivity of your restaurant by closing it eight weeks a year, you should do it. If you can keep open an excellent producer with local history and make good food available to more people, you should do it. Change, he hopes, begins with the revelatory first-hand experience of true quality. If you do something the right way, people might take notice and – maybe – want to do the same. * * * The night of the trial run began, as each service does, with a checklist. Jakob, who acts as each evening’s traffic cop, stands before the staff holding a piece of paper with the name of every ingredient on the menu, from king crab legs down to the oils and garnishes. Every time he names an ingredient, the chef responsible for that piece of the meal affirms, “Yes.” “Shallot?” “Yes.” “Seeds?” “Yes.” And so on. The first time I saw this, Nilsson, who was whispering to me about the American electorate and Swedish regional politics, paused to explain that this ritual is the restaurant’s system of accountability. “When they say yes, it means they take responsibility for the ingredient from its beginning to its current state, and then all the way to the diner’s mouth.” Fifteen minutes later, Zeller was still reading off the list: “Lupin curd? Marigold flowers? Ice cream? And the machine? And the basket?” At seven o’clock, the guests began to arrive and a silence fell in the kitchen. The chefs curled over their stations, and one of the apprentices began laying out the wide, wooden serving boards over the pass in preparation for the first course. Nilsson interrupted him to point out that one of the boards was not completely dry. The apprentice, a skinny young man with a toothbrush moustache, apologised and went away, returning with four trays to choose from. Nilsson said, his voice a little tighter, that it makes no sense to bring four trays over. “Just choose two correct ones.” The young man paused. “And you can’t freeze, you need to be able to take correction and keep working.” “Yes,” whispered the apprentice. Service began half an hour late, and the first few dishes brought pandemonium: ingredients were not ready at the same time and chefs kept bumping into each other, scrambling to figure out who was responsible for small details, such as cloths for wiping, spatulas, chives. An hour passed, then two. They struggled on through the courses – the asparagus was not set in the exact same place on each plate. The sourdough pancake was too big. The lupin curd gratin was a touch watery. Everything was too slow – the big red numbers of the clock counted to zero and when the alarm beeped the zero remained, blinking, and still the plates did not go. As the night wore on, Nilsson’s mood darkened and his body hunched. His brow travelled downward on his face until it was set in a deep furrow. He took over plating. “Who is supposed to be wiping this after me?” he called. “Why are you not here?” An apprentice stepped up with a towel and thrust it towards the plate. Nilsson slapped it away. “But do not get in the way.” No one could do anything right, and the general consensus in the room seemed to be that this was their fault rather than Nilsson’s. His occasionally vicious impatience is offset in other moments by his quick return to genuine friendliness with his staff, most of whom are his age. “I like that it must be very good all the time,” said Zeller later. “When he thinks something’s not right, he says ‘Is this the best you can do? Ask yourself what is the best.’” Watching Nilsson in the kitchen, or anywhere, one gets the strong impression that this is the only level he can stomach. After a particularly rough episode involving a pork chop, he called a chef over. “OK, now you have a moment. Do you have any questions? Are you prepared to do everything perfectly for the rest of service?” The young man began shuffling his notes, looking for his list of responsibilities. “I need to check.” “Yes or no?” “I believe so” “Yes. Or no.” Pause. “Yes.” “OK.” Nilsson then disappeared and popped back up in front of me, holding a glass of water. “I just realised you’ve gone all night with nothing to drink!” He grinned and settled in next to me, suddenly calm and chatty. “This is pretty good. We’ve had messier services.” He told me about the first night of spring season last year, which had been even worse: late dishes, skipped courses, imperfect execution. Only the next day did he find out that two emissaries from the Michelin guide had been there. The meal, messy as it may have been by Fäviken standards, earned the restaurant two stars. The goal is for everyone to be on the road home by 11pm, but by that time the staff were just finishing service and preparing for their postmortem. The guests, happy and full, were finding their way from the dining room to the front yard to wrap themselves up and sit around a fire. In the kitchen, Nilsson took the team through the errors and success of the evening in the even, encouraging tones of a coach. The list of corrections, Nilsson admitted, was longer than it would normally be, but this was OK – they would do it all again tomorrow. * * * “Food can never be worth this,” Nilsson said. It was the morning of the trial run, and he was sitting in the greenhouse he built in his garden in Mörsil, a small town 16 miles south of Fäviken, where he lives with his wife and three young children. We had been talking about the £250 cost of the Fäviken meal, and the even greater expense one has to lay out in airfare to get to the restaurant. One unsavory aspect of the notion that food is an expression of values – a notion Fäviken embodies – is that it divides the world into virtuous and unvirtuous eaters in a way that is unavoidably tied to class. The ethical food choices (“green”, “local”, “farm-to-table”, “non-GMO”) are luxuries. It may be true that we would all be better off if everyone shared Fäviken’s values when it comes to food, but few individuals are wealthy enough to make that choice, let alone eat at Nilsson’s restaurant. Did it bother him? Nilsson’s answer was predictably practical: the meal is expensive because excellent produce and an expert, well-treated staff is expensive. But he was uninterested in defending the cost on principle. “The idea of paying that much for a meal is a little ridiculous in a way. The food can never really be worth it. But what’s interesting is that the experience can be.” I finally ate the Fäviken meal on my last night in Jämtland. In the dining room arrived a pageant of dishes that was an almost hallucinatory assault on the senses. It was spectacular, but what was it that made this food meaningful? Was it the virtuosity? Was it the knowledge of what that virtuosity demanded? Everyone in the room had travelled hundreds or thousands of miles to be there. They ate their way through the courses carefully, comparing reality to expectation, appraising the experience as they would a painting by David Hockney. By Nilsson’s calculation, maybe only 5,000 customers have ever actually been to Fäviken. At the moment, he seems most excited about the way Fäviken’s principles might be extended beyond the restaurant. “This is an age when a chef is required to be someone who has opinions and participates in a public space,” he said. “You have to be more than just your restaurant.” He reaches a much wider audience through the media, but finds that an “inefficient” way of changing things because those people cannot taste his food. The food, he thinks, is the catalysing experience, the challenge: if you notice how much better this is than any other food you have had before, will you think to ask why? If you know the right way to do things, will you pursue it? This is why he is so enthusiastic about the Charkuteriefabrik, which can have 50,000 customers a week across Sweden. “They don’t get as much information as you do at Faviken,” said Nilsson, “but the food product itself, the same quality, it carries our message to them.” After his New York Times polemic against “food as art”, the outcry was so great that William Deresiewicz wrote a response. In it, he argued that food may be less the new art than the new religion. It is, he said, a way to “bring us into relationship with reality”. In the post-industrial age, in the post-electronic age, eating is one of the only remaining aesthetic experiences that is not reproducible. “You have to be there, have to be present, have to be in contact with the thing itself.” Nilsson once said something similar in an interview, when he described what it was like to eat food by Michel Bras, one of his great masters: “A plate comes alive when he makes it, and it vibrates. Do you understand? It actually vibrates, especially if you’re open to that kind of experience. And I am.” This experience may come from food that looks like a masterpiece, but Nilsson doesn’t think it has to. For me, that moment came after I had bid Fäviken goodbye, driven through the sunlit night to the nearest airport, and flown to Stockholm. I sought out Nilsson’s Korvkiosk, which was parked outside Trådgarden, a trendy music venue located underneath a major highway bridge. Its blue and yellow neon sign hummed cheerily in the late-breaking dusk as young people milled around it, on their way to and from a concert. A white-aproned cook handed me a skinny, slightly curved hot dog in a piece of fluffy yellow brioche, wrapped in paper. The meat was rough on the outside, pocked from charring, and dressed with a little ketchup. It was everything the Faviken meal was not: familiar, humble, a little bit ugly. I ate it walking. It was perfect. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here. This article was amended on 23 June 2016.

50,article,lifeandstyle/2016/may/25/pea-milk-non-dairy-ripple-france-environment,Food,2016-05-25,Drink pea milk and save the world: but what if the peas are shipped from France?,https://gu.com/p/4jbca,Lifestyle,Drink pea milk and save the world: but what if the peas are shipped from France?,<p>Ripple claims its non-dairy milk made from yellow split peas is more eco-friendly than its competitors – despite the main ingredient being shipped from overseas</p>,990,"On a recent Thursday night at trendy West Hollywood vegan outpost Gracias Madres, bartenders served up cocktails, including George Clooney’s Casamigos tequila, cocoa and … pea milk. Yes, pea milk, a liquid derived from yellow split peas, is the latest non-dairy milk to hit grocery store shelves. It joins hemp milk, brown rice milk and cashew drinks on the growing list of other alternatives in the now booming business of dairy alternatives. Non-dairy milk sales rose 9% in 2015 to $1.9bn, while dairy milk sales fell 7% in 2015 to $17.8bn and are expected to drop another 11% through 2020, according to a study released in April by market research firm Mintel. To stand out in this increasingly crowded market, Ripple, the pea milk purveyor, isn’t shying away from grandiose claims. “Drinking Ripple is an easy way to lower your carbon footprint,” its website boasts. Ripple also takes aim at competitors, particularly almond milk. “Unlike almonds, which require lots of water; or cattle, which contribute to deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions; peas have a small environmental footprint,” the website states. “Yellow peas grow in areas that receive lots of rain, so they need little or no irrigation.” In a world of plant-based, organic, non-GMO, non-dairy, gluten-free milk, can merely drinking a product save the planet? Or is it just greenwashing? In Ripple’s case, the answer is a little bit of both. For instance, amid its eco-friendly marketing, company’s website fails to mention its peas are from France. “We just couldn’t find good quality peas in North America,” co-founder Neil Renninger told the Guardian. The peas, supplied by French company Roquette, are transported to Rock City, Illinois, for processing in a facility that makes soy milk, he said. That a company that prides itself on being environmentally friendly, shipping its main ingredient thousands of miles on a barge would seem to go against its principles. “The problem I have with claims about sustainability like [Ripple’s], they don’t empower the consumer. They actually tend to disempower the consumer,” said David A Cleveland, an environmental studies professor at the University of California Santa Barbara who specializes in food miles. “They make a lot of one-off claims: ‘Our product has eight grams of protein.’ Well, so does soy milk. It’s advertising, not transparency.” But the issue of internationally transported peas doesn’t deter Ripple’s investors. It’s raised at least $13.6m mostly from “impact funds” focused on sustainability, an investor said. Catha Groot, a director at Eagle Cliff Partners, says sustainability is the first screening for the fund’s investments, which are typically $500,000 to $2m in early stages. Admitting that the transatlantic supply is not ideal, she compares pea milk to the cricket industry, in which her firm is also considering an investment. “A lot of startups are thinking of producing food out of crickets as a sustainable source of protein. But something like 95% of crickets are grown in Thailand right now,” Groot said. “In certain cases I think you start by creating a market and by creating a market, producers can justify getting going in the US or somewhere that makes more sense.” Ripple maintains that transport by cargo ships from Europe to Newark, New Jersey, then by rail to Chicago, and then by trucks from Chicago to Rock City, uses lower carbon emissions than the most likely scenario of trucking almonds from California to Chicago, where Ripple says most almond milk is processed, a company spokeswoman wrote in an email. In addition, according to a recent story in Mashable, the company is also looking to find a domestic farm source. But that may be misleading, says Cleveland, who recently embarked on a study comparing the carbon footprint of plant-based milks but stopped when he realized it was impossible to compare disparate products and processes. “Basically Ripple’s whole promotion seems to be cherry-picking facts to distract people from looking at the big picture,” he said. “They don’t talk about the impact of cane sugar, sunflower oil or algal oil, which are also ingredients of the pea milk. What is the processing? If we want to talk about sustainability, companies need to be transparent. There’s a lot of variation out there – all peas aren’t made the same. What’s required are verified data on the impacts of the entire life cycle of the actual ingredients in their products, not generic statements. People need to be treated like they’re intelligent so they can actually make decisions.” For its part, the almond industry has weathered harsh criticism in recent years for requiring as much as as much as 1.1 gallons of water to grow an almond, especially as California endured an epic drought in the last few years. As almond prices rose, some farmers looked to cash in and boosted their crops. Califia Farms, a beverage company that produces almond milk and also uses yellow split peas from Canada, CEO and co-founder Greg Steltenpohl told the Guardian. “The problem is you can’t bounce back and forth between how much it costs in water to grow a pea versus the water and energy component of a finished drink,” he said, taking issue with Ripple’s almond milk numbers. “People either need to rely on one convention and have transparency with it or put the claims on really bigger differences. Our position is that it’s less than dairy milk.” Cleveland agrees. Despite the disparities in measuring the environmental cost of almonds, peas, hemp or soy, Cleveland agrees with Steltenpohl and Ripple about one thing: all of the plant-based beverages are much better for the planet than dairy milk from cows, which produces copious amounts of methane. In any case, the quibbling about sustainability may be moot. At the end of the day, milk drinkers don’t choose based on carbon footprints, says Mintel’s Sisel. “Taste trumps everything.” • The headline of this article was amended on 25 May 2016 to clarify that Ripple ships its peas from France via barge, not plane.",https://media.guim.co.uk/3d377aba8f965d85d0fd136cc3550a6083ac169d/0_4_2208_1325/500.jpg,0.07625855327468231

No, not the famously charming Four Weddings and a Funeral actor, but the far more controversial self-described “Scottish optimist” who is chairman and chief executive of US agrochemical company Monsanto, AKA “the most evil company in the world”. It’s a big weekend for Grant and Monsanto, a company that has been fighting against adverse publicity since its production of deadly herbicide Agent Orange in the 1960s and, more recently, its role at the forefront of genetically engineered crops. Now it is battling an unsolicited multibillion-dollar takeover from the German chemicals company Bayer that would create the dominant force in the world’s food supply. It’s a role reversal for Grant, who had overseen Monsanto – which also makes the controversial and probably carcinogenic Roundup weedkiller – during a series of takeovers by the agrochemical giant. Last month, one such attempt hit a roadblock when Monsanto dropped its long pursuit of the Swiss seed and pesticide maker Syngenta, losing to ChemChina. Grant told investors that Monsanto was better off alone. But, analysts say, Grant had left the firm vulnerable to a takeover itself. Earning forecasts had been cut, and the company was entangled in legal disputes across the world, sending its shares down almost 20% before news of the Bayer approach. “It’s a relentless string of bad news,” Jonas Oxgaard, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, told Bloomberg. “It’s almost like they forgot to sacrifice a goat to the gods.” The news will get worse this weekend, when hundreds of thousands of activists join a day of coordinated marches against Monsanto in more than 400 cities across the world. In New York, campaigners promoted the march with a billboard in Times Square showing a topless model and the slogan “Keep GMOs out of your genes”. Grant, 57, is used to controversy. Born in Larkhall, near Glasgow, he has worked at Monsanto since he was 23, first in Scotland and in Asia before moving to the US and becoming president and CEO in 2003. He regularly faces protests from campaigners outside events, and even stars of the silver screen have been known to give him an earful. Just before Christmas, Oscar-nominated actor Mark Ruffalo accosted Grant in green room of CBS studios to tell him: “You are poisoning people. You are killing small farms. You are killing bees. What you are doing is dead wrong.” Writing about the encounter, Ruffalo said he felt he had to approach Grant because he was “beside myself watching this guy who is responsible for so much misery and sickness throughout the world slime his way through his interview. I could not hold my tongue.” Grant’s reply: “What I think we are doing is good.” When protests are expected, Grant likes to be prepared. On the mornings of the company’s always-fiery annual meetings, Grant, who is paid more than $11m (£7.6m), makes arrangements for protesting shareholders to meet scientists and himself before taking their questions publicly at the meeting. At this year’s meeting, Zen Honeycutt, founder of Moms Across America, who described him on her website as “the CEO of the Most Evil Company in the World”, told Grant: “I’m imploring you to choose a new direction. Stop poisoning our children,” in a reference to claimed links between Roundup and autism and cancer. Pointing out that he was a father of three, Grant, who holds molecular biology and agricultural degrees from Glasgow and Edinburgh universities, said various studies had shown there was “no linkage” between glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, and any human illnesses. However, the European Union this week delayed a vote on whether to continue to allow Roundup sales beyond June due to concerns that it could be carcinogenic. Concerns were led by France and Germany, and those countries are likely to lead a fight against the Bayer-Monsanto tie-up, which some fear could lead to more GMO crops and potentially dangerous pesticides entering Europe. “Germans view Monsanto as the main example of American corporate evil,” Heike Moldenhauer, a biotechnology expert at German environmental group BUND, told Bloomberg. “It may not be such a good idea to take over Monsanto, as that means incorporating its bad reputation, which would also make Bayer more vulnerable.” Campaigners are also worried that the proposed takeover, which was made public by Monsanto late into the night on Wednesday just hours after a senior executive had dismissed rumors of an approach as “wild speculation”, will leave control of the world’s food supply in too few hands. If Monsanto is bought (the price has not been made public, but it is said to be about $42bn) the combined Bayer-Monsanto will control 29% of the world’s seed market and 24% of the pesticide market. “A further concentration of corporate power in the agriculture/chemical sector would be bad news for farmers and consumers,” said Franziska Achterberg, Greenpeace’s EU food policy director. “It would accelerate the decrease in crop diversity while limiting consumer choice. Farmers would become even more dependent on just a handful of global players. They would find it harder to choose what they grow and how they grow it.” Grant says the problem is that consumers have become too distant from the food they eat, with just 2% of the world’s population involved in agriculture, and the food industry needs to do a better job of educating them about the challenges ahead. He told the Fortune Brainstorm E conference in California this week that to feed an ever-growing population, food production needed to double by 2050 while using roughly the same land area and trying to reduce water use. After playing defense, his aim now is to convince millennials of the need for more GM crops, which require less natural resources to grow. He’s started by hiring more young people. “We have an enormous community of millennials, and they’re there because they want to be there,” he said. If you’re interested in plant biology, the “party is at Monsanto”.",https://media.guim.co.uk/bb710754b0bc9cd7118169e0b89d3a61539300ee/0_187_5400_3240/500.jpg,0.023633392751039803

Hulking trucks are loading pre-burned cane from the Hawaiian Corporate and Sugar Company (HC&amp;S)’s 144th crop into the rust-colored factory where it will be rolled, shredded, squeezed and boiled into molasses. Passenger jets rumbling over the cane fields are a reminder that tourism has overtaken sugar in recent years, and assumed the role of largest industry in Maui. For more than 150 years, the big agricultural corporations that produce sugar have been top dogs in the island’s economic life and its political governance. As the industry winds down, a new generation of activists are dreaming big of replacing sugar not only with a new agricultural model but also a new political settlement. Tiare Lawrence, a native Hawaiian who grew up next to a sugar mill, is an activist who is instrumental in several campaigns fighting what she calls Big Ag – companies such as HC&amp;S and Monsanto. Lawrence watches the sugar factory belching out sweet acrid fumes and reflects on the symbolism that sugar has represented to her homeland and its peoples: “The big agricultural businesses which grew sugar as a mono-crop overthrew our Hawaiian kingdom and they stole a lot of the lands for their crops and the water for their fields. … A lot of families want to return home and farm but they need water to do that, and HC&amp;S still keep most of the water for themselves.” Recent controversies over diverting water from rural East Maui’s streams, using pesticides, and burning cane fields, which exacerbate respiratory illnesses, have hung over HC&amp;S. But with 36,000 acres of land in the middle of Maui’s fertile saddle, they aren’t planning on going anywhere soon. The company says it hopes it can still find a way to profit from their land holdings. Commenting on the end of their sugar business, Stanley M Kuriyama, executive chairman of the parent company, Alexander and Baldwin (A&amp;B) said: “We have made every effort to avoid having to take this action. However, the roughly $30m agribusiness operating loss we expect to incur in 2015, and the forecast for continued significant losses, clearly are not sustainable, and we must now move forward with a new concept for our lands that allows us to keep them in productive agricultural use.” Kaniela Ing, a Democratic state representative for Maui who chairs the office of Hawaiian affairs, might be expected to have sympathy for the 650 people losing their jobs at the end of this year, but he is focused on Maui’s future agricultural economy, which he thinks should include hemp. “We don’t want one mono-crop like sugar to be replaced by another like GMO corn. In reality we want diverse agriculture that is organic, rotational and can replenish the soil, and hemp is a good part of that solution.” Access to Maui’s water resources is another big issue. Farmers on East Maui are trying to prevent A&amp;B from making permanent the water use permits that have kept sugar cane bountiful and would be needed for their future diversification plans. On the west side, farmers are trying to reclaim access to streams that have been dammed and diverted for others including the sugar company. Hokuao Pellegrino’s eco farm sits right next to one of the streams; it used to roar down the nearby mountain and out into the ocean but is now more sedate. He claims that the water and sugar companies have been water-banking for years and preventing farmers growing taro, a starchy staple for islanders. “The demise of sugar is their own fault. They will tell you it is because of us fighting them over the water but it’s nothing to do with the water, it’s everything to do with their business model and their archaic farming practices. The health of their soil is terrible, it has no nutrient base. They don’t fallow, they don’t rotate crops, they just burn, till, plant, burn, till, plant.” The post-sugar agricultural vision for Maui is being hotly debated and Monsanto, which is appealing a moratorium on the production of GMO crops on Maui, is thought to be casting an avaricious eye on the 36,000 acres about to come up for grabs. Despite HC&amp;S claims that they are researching diverse agricultural model to replace sugar, the fear among many who see the island’s future as being organic and closer to the traditional Hawaiian concept of Aina (“that which feeds us”) is that Monsanto will end up leasing the redundant fields and growing GMO corn. Big Ag’s role in the illegal overthrow of the Hawaiian kingdom in 1893 is not being easily forgotten either. Since Bill Clinton’s 1993 apology there has been pressure building for some kind of return of sovereignty to the indigenous people, but it has been a protracted and controversial process. “It turns out that under the monarchy we were citizens, we had a bill of rights, so this isn’t about being a native Hawaiian who was here prior to Captain Cook. It isn’t about race or ethnicity, it is about nationality,” said Keoki Sousa, 72, who can be found most mornings paddling 500-meter sprints in the ocean. “My Portuguese ancestors were citizens, my Scottish and Hawaiian ancestors were citizens of the kingdom. The US government frames the whole debate it in terms of race and that suits them because they want us to settle for federal recognition like Native American tribes which is a dead-end in my view.” Ing is pragmatic about how sovereignty might be returned to Hawaii and he regards the greater teaching of Hawaiian language in schools and a new cultural sense of self among many young Hawaiians as a harbinger of a new form of nationhood. However, when it comes to the sugar industry his view is resolute. “This is is an opportunity,” he said, “for these historically greedy missionary families who created the sugar industry to … give back what is owed to the people of Maui.” “This is not too complicated. When you take something from someone the moral thing to do is to give it back.”",https://media.guim.co.uk/2f2c996b88e15724b543ad9a2bd5ba9ce2908ed3/0_0_3000_1800/500.jpg,0.09494374385678733

I advocate buying second-hand, but I leased new. I encourage walking and biking and public transportation, and I do take advantage of these options on a regular basis, yet there I was, taking the keys and driving away with a shiny new ride and a sinking sense of discomfort. Likewise, I recently met an environmental lawyer (and a car-less one too, I might add). He came to his profession amid a deep and decades-long affinity for the lakes and rivers which make Canada beautiful, and a strong desire to protect them. Yet the same work, in which he makes great strides to protect these natural landscapes, also prevents him from enjoying them. He works 50 to 70 hours a week in a downtown office, spending hours staring at a pixelated computer screen rather than the starry sky. When he tells me about it, he sounds vaguely helpless. He’s torn between the change he wants to create, and his ability to see the natural world for more than the odd weekend between cases. This tension is familiar in the lives of most environmentalists. Some own cars; some still eat meat. The more famous in our midst regularly fly great distances to speak about the horrific impact of carbon emissions – such as the 53lb of CO2 released by their airplanes with each and every mile traveled. This unbearable hypocrisy is a struggle for the individual and a delight for the critic, yet it seems both necessary and inescapable. All of us exist within the very system we hope to change. I use a laptop, a smartphone, internet, electricity. Most of the publications I write anti-consumerism articles for are propped up and paid for by advertisements. This hypocrisy is a delicate balancing act. It speaks to the seemingly inescapable reality of this North American machine we’ve built and which now runs our life. In order to avoid it, one needs to escape to the woods, go off the grid. You’ll subtract most of your environmental impact by doing so. I think everyone fantasises about it from time to time (I certainly do), but you’ll also lose priceless human connection and culture, alongside the ability to educate or inspire change in others. The fear of navigating this cognitive dissonance, as well as the fear of armchair critics declaring that you’ve failed is, I believe, at the heart of many people’s reluctance to adopt more green practices. If you begin to use cloth diapers or ride your bike or compost, you are tacitly branding yourself. You’re dipping a toe into the often-mocked world of Portlandia characters, the shrill hippies who speak in acronyms (GMO, BPA, SLS, WTF?), and the righteously indignant environmentalists who rail against big oil while still availing themselves of heated homes and gas-powered transportation. By doing so, you open yourself to harsh criticism; you’re asked to justify your decision to change anything when you’re not committing to change everything. It can be intimidating: suddenly you’re expected to have all the answers. “Why bother recycling when you still drive?” “How can you wear leather when you don’t eat meat?” “Aren’t those annual flights erasing the impact of anything else you do?” My reluctant decision to continue owning a car came about as a result of a handful of carefully considered factors: the limited public transportation options in my city, six months of Canadian winter, car shares which can’t accommodate a car seat for my daughter, and a custody agreement which requires me to drive her to see her dad three hours away, twice a month. To be honest, it makes me feel bad, but I’ve also realized that choosing to try means also accepting that you’ll fail, at least some of the time. You can either accept the status quo, or you can work towards something better. Doing so often looks less like an off-grid hut in the woods and more like finding a way to exist in an uncomfortably unsustainable society while also trying to change it. I think George Monbiot summed it up best: “Hypocrisy is the gap between your aspirations and your actions. Greens have high aspirations – they want to live more ethically – and they will always fall short. But the alternative to hypocrisy isn’t moral purity (no one manages that), but cynicism. Give me hypocrisy any day.”",https://media.guim.co.uk/14a5f587616d70de4627047d6c53f8171c6df6ac/0_142_4367_2623/500.jpg,0.13294654620741583

That, and GMO-labelling initiatives, are all great, but canned foods still aren’t fresh, local or sustainable</p>",569,"If a company wants customers to buy its products, it must make products customers want to buy. Americans these days don’t want artificial and unsustainably produced ingredients in the food they buy and eat. For the makers of highly processed foods – ultraprocessed in today’s terminology – there isn’t a lot that they can do to make the products appear fresh and natural. But Campbell’s is certainly trying. A few months after announcing that it will phase out genetically modified organisms (GMOs), the iconic soup company said on Friday that it will remove Bisphenol-A (BPA) from its cans by next year. BPA, you will recall, is a chemical typically used in polycarbonate plastic containers and in the epoxy linings of food cans. It’s also an endocrine disrupter, which means it can interfere with the work our hormones are doing. Some research finds BPA to have effects on childhood development and reproduction. Although the FDA doesn’t believe evidence of potential harm is sufficient to ban BPA from the food supply, the agency discourages use of BPA-polycarbonate or epoxy resins in baby bottles, sippy cups or packaging for infant formulas. For the past year or so, other retailers have been working hard to phase out BPA and to reassure customers that their cans and packages are safe. All of these companies sell highly processed foods in an era when the public is demanding – and voting with their dollars – for fresh, natural, organic, locally grown and sustainably produced ingredients. They can’t provide those things, but they can tout the bad, or unpopular, things that aren’t part of their product, the “no’s”: no unnatural additives, no artificial colors or flavors, no high fructose corn syrup, no trans fat, no gluten and, yes, no GMOs or BPA. Let me add something about companies labeling their products GMO-free. In my view, the food biotechnology industry created this market – and greatly promoted the market for organics, which do not allow GMOs – by refusing to label which of its products contain GMOs and getting the FDA to go along with that decision. Whether or not GMOs are harmful, transparency in food marketing is hugely important to increasing segments of the public. People don’t trust the food industry to act in the public interest; transparency increases trust. Vermont voted last year to mandate GMO labeling in the state – the US Senate rejected a bill in mid-March attempting to undermine it – and food conglomerates such as Campbell’s, General Mills, ConAgra, Kellogg and Mars have committed to labeling their products as containing GMO. In addition to removing BPA from packaging and GMO from products, at least 11 other companies have announced recently that say they are phasing out as many artificial additives as possible, as quickly as they can. Taco Bell, for example, will get rid of Yellow Dye #6, high fructose corn syrup, palm oil and artificial preservatives, and replace them with “natural” ingredients. Huge food companies such as Kraft, Nestlé (no relation) and General Mills are heading in the same direction. All this may well benefit consumers to an extent. It also makes perfect sense from a business perspective: the “no’s” sell. But what everyone needs to remember is that foods labeled “free from” still have calories and may well contain excessive salt and sugars. The healthiest diets contain vegetables and lots of other relatively unprocessed foods. No amount of subtraction from highly processed foods is going to change that.",https://media.guim.co.uk/1f88c65a7d9d5ed67231752811bf3f21ed45a34c/0_0_5120_3071/500.jpg,0.05243697478991597

Now, advocacy groups are waiting to see if the costly investment will pay off</p>",1034,"Consumers around the country will soon know just by looking at the packaging of popular brands such as Cocoa Puffs cereal or Yoplait yogurt whether or not they contain genetically modified ingredients. (The answer: they both do.) That’s because their maker, General Mills, plans to make that information visible on its products nationwide, even though the move is costly and could lower sales. General Mills announced its labeling decision last Friday, and other major food companies have since followed, including Kellogg, ConAgra and candy maker Mars. Campbell Soup publicized the same decision in January. The companies are all responding to a Vermont law requiring the labeling of genetically modified foods starting in July, and to pressure from consumers and advocacy groups to reveal more information about controversial ingredients. “We can’t label our products for only one state without significantly driving up costs for our consumers – and we simply will not do that,” said Jeff Harmening, vice president and chief operating officer for US Retail at General Mills, in a statement. Between 70% and 80% of packaged food in the US contains ingredients from genetically modified organisms (GMO), according to the Grocery Manufacturers Association, an industry trade group. A genetically modified organism is created in a laboratory by taking genes from one species and inserting these genes into another to breed certain characteristics. In the US, genetic engineering is primarily used on corn, soybeans and cotton to make these crops more pest and disease resistant and drought tolerant. These crops are cheaper to grow and help keep food prices low. Debate about the safety of GMOs has remained contentious ever since they were first introduced into the food supply in the 1990s. Opponents say GMOs could cause health problems to humans and wildlife. The Federal Drug Administration (FDA), along with hundreds of scientific studies, maintain that these ingredients are safe for human consumption. “To be clear, this is not a question of safety,” said Thomas Hushen, a spokesperson for Campbell Soup Company. “GMOs are safe – the science tells us so – and we continue to believe the technology will play a critical role in feeding the world on a sustainable basis.” The dispute over the safety of using GMOs has evolved into a battle over labeling. Big food companies have historically fought mandatory labeling out of concerns that the new labels will scare off customers. They worry that genetic manipulation creates an impression that the food is unnatural or unhealthy, an image that anti-GMO groups try to reinforce in public campaigns. Meanwhile, anti-GMO advocacy groups, such as Center For Food Safety, and food makers who say they don’t use GMOs, including Plum Organics and Nature’s Path, also cast the fight as an issue of transparency, and accuse food makers of hiding important information from the public. The cost of adding a few words Vermont is the first state to require mandatory labeling, and more than 20 other states are considering similar laws. While food makers previously fought efforts to create a national labeling rule, they now prefer to deal with one federal regulation rather than a patchwork of state laws. Adding GMO labels to products they sell across the country will also be simpler and cheaper than doing so only for foods destined for Vermont, the food makers said. “The Vermont law is an example of a state law which is impractical and creates unnecessary confusion for consumers,” Hushen said. “We are seeking a national, mandatory approach which is clear and simple for consumers and creates a level playing field for food companies.” None of the food companies divulged the exact costs of changing their packaging to show the new wording. Mike Siemienas, spokesman for General Mills, told the Guardian that adding the new label will cost millions of dollars. One study from Emory University estimated the costs to be a one-time expense of $1,104.43 per product, which the authors calculated using past federal government estimates and factoring in inflation. But, according to some researchers, food makers won’t likely increase the price of their products to offset the cost of relabeling, for fear of losing customers. Food companies could incur even more expenses if they don’t follow the Vermont law. The state could fine them $1,000 a day per day. Certain foods are exempt, however, such as meat and dairy, products verified as non-GMO and items that contain less than 0.9% of genetically modified ingredients. The fight over consumers Safety will remain a big question for consumers because many of them aren’t likely to be familiar with genetically engineered food ingredients, said William Lesser, a professor at Cornell’s Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management. The labels that will show up on packages certainly won’t have any adequate explanation. There are no national rules for what the label has to say. Kellogg, for instance, says its wording will be: “produced with genetic engineering”. Campbell posted a mock-up online of what a new label will look like on a can of its SpaghettiOs. The label says: “partially produced with genetic engineering”. The increasing consumer demand for healthier foods, or at least products that appear wholesome, adds a new dimension to the GMO controversy, said Michelle Greenwald, a professor at Columbia Business School. GMO labels will turn away some shoppers because genetic manipulation evokes something unnatural, she said. The packaged-food industry has already seen a drop in sales in recent years because of changing consumer preferences. That will also make it tricky to determine whether any declining sales are directly connected to GMO labeling. Hans Taparia, an assistant professor at the New York University Stern School of Business and co-founder of an organic food business, said food companies are banding together to roll out GMO labels around the same time in order to minimize any negative impact to their sales. The hope is that consumers will get used to seeing the labels and won’t pause and question their existence. “GMOs is not a topic front and center for the consumer to begin with, in spite of the lobbying,” said Taparia. “The fact it’s happening across so many brands at the same time, it’s probably going to take the wind out of the sails of the non-GMO movement.”",http://media.guim.co.uk/7ec4a27be99bb9733ae6e4bf3616f4aa489bf85b/0_256_3884_2331/500.jpg,0.10121899496899499
56,article,technology/2016/mar/18/apple-first-amendment-defense-big-pharma-tobacco-tech-companies,Technology,2016-03-18,"Big pharma, tobacco, tech - how the first amendment is being abused",https://gu.com/p/4hkch,News,"Big pharma, tobacco, tech - how the first amendment is being abused",<p>Apple is not the first corporation to deploy the free speech argument to support their position – corporations have been co-opting the principle since the 1970s</p>,906,"The first amendment to the US constitution – guarantor of freedom of speech and of the press, as well as the freedom of religion and assembly – is a sacred creed to many Americans. For most of its history, it was understood principally as a guardian of individual liberty and a protector of public discourse. Increasingly, and not accidentally, the business community is using the first amendment to block economic regulation. Last week, the US Department of Justice and the Federal Drug Administration surrendered to big pharma, and gave up on trying to enforce a rule that had prohibited pharmaceutical companies from marketing their drugs for purposes that have not been expressly approved. This marketing restriction had long been a sort of policy compromise that let doctors prescribe drugs for novel uses, but restrained drug companies from marketing those uses until fully vetted. But industry prevailed on the argument that the rule violated the marketers’ freedom of speech, and this is only the most recent development in a growing trend to restrict economic regulation in the name of corporate free speech. US courts grow more sympathetic to the “civil liberties” of corporations, and no businesses stand to gain more than tech companies. Over the past few years, industry has successfully beaten down tobacco warning labels and corporate supply chain reporting requirements. Trade associations are currently battling GMO food labeling, obesity warning labels for sugary drinks, and surely will soon take up arms against new nutrition labels. In all these cases, the business community has argued that the government has overstepped by compelling corporations to speak against their will. The aggrieved companies have made use of precedents that protect individuals from swearing loyalty oaths or pledging allegiance to the flag. They have argued, in essence, that corporations have a kind of conscience, and that when government mandates speech of anything more than the clearly rote and descriptive – such as “this way out” – it threatens the integrity of that conscience. It wasn’t until 1976 that the supreme court first held that commercial speech was entitled to free speech protection. Professor John Coates has found that since then, the beneficiaries of first amendment litigation have shifted decidedly towards corporations and away from individuals. The pace of the litigation has picked up speed in the past five years as free enterprise thinktanks, such as the Washington Legal Foundation, came to see that corporations could assert the first amendment against regulations that either restricted or compelled their speech, such as disclosure requirements. First amendment scholar Frederick Schauer has called this “First Amendment opportunism”, while Tim Wu has described “how corporations hijacked the First Amendment”. This corporate colonization is proceeding from two directions. First is the expansion of the legal fiction that corporations are people. The more endowed with individual liberties a corporation becomes, the more that disclosure requirements and product labels come to look like compelled testimony. Second, the scope of protected speech is growing. When the supreme court first recognized protection of commercial speech, it was at a decidedly lower level than protection of individual speech, “commensurate with its subordinate position in the scale of First Amendment values”. Courts are extending protections to more kinds of speech, with the current US supreme court under Chief Justice John Roberts issuing the most expansive first amendment rulings ever. The most recent supreme court case to deal with the issue of corporate speech held that physicians’ drug-prescribing data was protected by the first amendment and could not be regulated for the sake of patient privacy. Following on this, some scholars such as Jane Bambauer have argued that data = speech, making privacy and other sorts of regulation difficult to sustain over constitutional objection. It is not much of a leap from data = speech to code = speech. And that is what Apple has argued in its ongoing battle with the FBI over unlocking the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone. Apple claims that the government’s order that the company produce code “amounts to compelled speech and viewpoint discrimination in violation of the first amendment”. Apple characterizes the encryption that is required to make the code function as bearing its “signature”, likening it to the kind of personal authentication that might underlie a confession. The Electronic Frontier Foundation supports and explains Apple’s position. The idea is that the Apple signature required for the software “conveys its strong endorsement of the signed code” and constitutes “an affirmation of belief” along the lines of a pledge of allegiance. If this kind of argument prevails, it would mean that a company could configure its software to require signed code for any substantial modification. As a result, any regulation requiring such a modification would transgress the conscience of the company by forcing its signature. Such mandated modifications might involve making a device handicapped-accessible, defending against a cybersecurity threat, enabling interoperability, or complying with an emergency response protocol. All such regulation would become fields of constitutional battle. Apple is not the only technology company reaching for the first amendment as a cudgel. Telecommunications carriers have also asserted it as an argument against net neutrality regulations. In these cases, the companies have stronger arguments against regulation. The attempt to constitutionalize these regulatory fights is bound to further blur the line between individual liberties and corporate license. And in a world that is increasingly run on data and regulated through information, it could gut reasonable regulation and perhaps lead to more draconian governmental intrusions.",http://media.guim.co.uk/0d12a91b6ee6470395fb6d23f15407f3907a7217/0_0_3500_2101/500.jpg,0.16891443504815595

It grows as a fluffy white plant and is processed into towels and flannels – clean stuff. Upsettingly, it has a lengthy ecological rap sheet that means it is the filthiest of all fibres. While it covers just 2.5% of the planet’s total agricultural area, the cotton crop uses 7% of all pesticides and 16% of all insecticides. There are entire chemical companies making neurotoxic formulas just to support this crop. And it takes nearly 4,000 litres of water to make a single pair of jeans. It’s almost enough to make us yearn for the entirely polyester wardrobes of the 1970s or even drive us to hemp – a fibre often touted as the solution, though in reality it is blended with cotton. Luckily, organic cotton, grown to stringent international standards where few agrichemicals are permitted, is readily available. A recent study on the long-term effects of growing it in India claimed big environmental savings and a boon for the farmers who converted. But other reports suggest that organic cotton can’t keep up with demand. Alternative standards promising cleaner cotton have leapt into the gap: Fairtrade, Cleaner Cotton, e3 (GMO seed-free cotton), Cotton made in Africa (CmiA) and the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI). With a stated aim of turning a third of all the world’s cotton sustainable by 2050, the latter seems the most ambitious. Brokered by WWF among retailers and the many middlemen and agents in the supply chain, BCI cotton is grown in Brazil, Mali, Kenya and Pakistan. There are six basic principles that include minimising chemicals and using water efficiently. BCI may not have organic’s rigour, but retailers like it: Ikea is now sourcing all of its cotton through the system. The big picture: Indonesia on fire Nothing screams ‘emergency on planet Earth’ like these pictures from Indonesia. For over two months thousands of fires have been raging as a consequence of the slash-and-burn farming techniques for palm oil plantations (palm oil is contained in 50% of supermarket products). The fires have produced more carbon emissions than Japan does in a year, sometimes surpassing the daily emissions output of the United States. Well dressed: Ikat fashio with a consience Using a blend of cotton and silk, the art of ikat weaving in south and southeast India is as fascinating as the finished designs it produces. Each yarn is coloured separately, marked in paint based on the design, then woven together to give the fabric a delicate look, with motifs appearing to fade at the edges. It is impossible to mass produce the woven fabric and no two garments are exactly the same. That’s why it was important for Smita Kumar and Haseena Lathif to include ikat weave designs in their new sustainable fashion ecommerce site, DFYnorm.com. For anyone keen to find something new and unexpected for your next wardrobe hit, you will find it here. Kumar and Lathif tracked down ikat weavers in Pochampally, India, to make their tailored ikat jacket design. It’s a match made in heaven.

But are we facing another GM food-style furore?,https://gu.com/p/4gf9n,News,Gene editing could create medicines and self-fertilising crops. But are we facing another GM food-style furore?,The technique could transform life for farmers and Parkinson’s sufferers. But critics insist it remains unproven – and the EU may end up blocking it,1777,"Outside Norwich, in a refrigerated cupboard in the basement of the John Innes Centre, racks of glass tubes filled with bright green shoots have been arranged in neat, carefully labelled layers. They look like salad pots at a fast-food outlet. These young barley plants are special, however, and not for sale. They have been grown from seeds whose DNA has been subtly altered by a technique known as gene editing and they hold dramatic promise, scientists at the crop research centre believe. Their makeup is being tweaked in an attempt to create a strain of barley that would make its own ammonium fertiliser from nitrogen in the soil: this would be a major boost for farmers who lack rich soil or money to buy artificial fertilisers. The art and science of gene – or genome – editing is making waves. Last week it generated headlines when researchers were given the go-ahead to use the technique to alter human embryos in a project aimed at better understanding the causes of miscarriages. Now it is set to have an equally revolutionary impact on agriculture – though for gene-edited crops, the science faces a serious obstacle. In a few weeks, European commission regulators are set to publish a report that will decide whether gene-edited crops should be considered to be genetically modified organisms. If the commission report backs such a verdict, the stringent EU legislation and complex regulations that have almost completely blocked the growing of GM (genetically modified) crops in Europe would be extended to those created through gene-editing – despite the relative simplicity of the technique and the vast potential it holds. “It would be a real step backwards,” said Professor Wendy Harwood, leader of the gene-edited barley research project. “It would turn projects that cost a few thousand pounds into ones that would require millions of pounds of funding to fulfil the requirements of the complex EU bureaucracy that is used to regulate GM crop growing in Europe. Only big biotechnology companies would be able to afford to make gene-edited crops.” It’s a worrying prospect for scientists, and many now fear that the commission ruling will go against them. “I am very pessimistic,” said Professor Michael Bevan, another John Innes researcher. “The EU food standards agency has already been making pronouncements that they are going to class anything that is ‘not natural’ as GM. If they go ahead with such a decision, they will cut off many approaches for creating new foods and crops.” Gene-editing techniques work like the find-and-replace function on a word processor. First, they locate a gene to be edited, then they make the necessary change to it, either by deleting or repairing it or, in some cases, by inserting a new gene from another species. The technology has made genetic modification a dramatically simpler process to operate and is transforming medicine. But the technology also has considerable agricultural potential. Instead of inserting a completely new gene from another organism into a plant’s chromosomes – genetic modification – the new technique of gene-editing usually only involves fiddling with the crop’s existing DNA. “You can tell if a crop has been genetically modified, but it is impossible to tell if a plant has been subject to gene editing,” added Harwood. “It is closer to old-fashioned breeding techniques than it is to genetic modification technology.” The green movement disagrees. It views gene editing as a technique that is hardly different from the genetic engineering techniques used to make GM crops. Hence its support for the inclusion of gene-edited crops within the EU’s GM regulatory framework. “Gene editing changes the genetic code using material from outside the target organism,” said Franziska Achterberger of Greenpeace. “Much like older genetic modification techniques, it also entails numerous risks and uncertainties. The engineering process is not well-understood and can result in unexpected and unpredictable effects on the environment and human and animal health.” But most scientists argue that if regulations covering GM crops are extended to those created by gene editing – a technique that has emerged only in the past two or three years – the impact would be profound and harmful. Stringent EU rules and the efforts of green activists have ensured GM crops have become, in Europe, as rare as sunflowers in the desert. Only one genetically modified strain is now grown commercially within the whole of the EU. This is Bt maize, engineered to produce toxins derived from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). This poison kills the European corn borer worm, a substantial maize pest, and so the GM version of the crop needs less insecticide than standard, non-GM strains. This dearth of GM crops has not stopped genetically modified foods from appearing in the UK, however. Much soya-based animal feed imported into the UK is genetically modified. As a result, most non-organic pork and chicken meat in our supermarkets comes from animals that have been reared on imported GM feed. Nor have UK scientists given up trying to create new GM crops. Potatoes that can resist blight and aphid-resistant wheat have been developed and field trials launched, sometimes sparking violent protest. Harwood’s trial field of GM barley was destroyed by protesters several years ago. “A year’s work was ruined in a few minutes,” she recalled. Now Harwood has moved on to use gene editing and is working on a project, backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to create cereal crops that make their own nitrogen fertilisers. “Nitrogen fixing is complex but we are uncovering how it works by switching off individual barley genes using gene editing and so working out a pathway that could allow cereals to make their own ammonium fertiliser. The point is that gene editing makes this a very simple process – and a very promising one.” Other gene-editing work at the John Innes Centre includes research by Professor Cathie Martin, who is working on creating strains of beetroot that could produce L-Dopa, a drug used to treat Parkinson’s disease. “Beetroot make L-Dopa, but other genes then turn this compound into dyes,” said Martin. “It is the process by which the vegetable gets its deep purple colour. “However, we are working on ways to gene edit beetroot to turn off those pathways and so let the L-Dopa accumulate inside it. In this way, we would make a white beetroot filled with drugs to treat Parkinson’s disease. For poorer countries this would be a particularly important, cheap source of a drug that might be too expensive to buy.” The crucial point, adds Martin, is that the creation of an L-Dopa beetroot is possible by standard breeding techniques, but would take far longer than it would using gene editing, provided this were not entangled in complex EU regulations. “The two techniques produce indistinguishable results, but one – gene editing – is much quicker to implement,” she added. Scientists acknowledge that in some cases – when it is used to insert a completely new gene – gene editing could be seen as genetic modification. But in many cases it involves merely deleting a few bases of DNA from a plant’s chromosome. “That type of gene editing should not be covered by GMO regulations,” said Professor Huw Jones of Aberystwyth University. “A blanket imposition of GMO regulations for gene editing would simply be wrong.” The green movement is unconvinced. “The various gene-editing technologies are still GM, and we are clear they fall within the definition of GM in existing EU law,” said Lord Melchett, policy director of the Soil Association and one of the key players in the UK organic food industry. “Gene editing carries with it the same potential for unforeseeable disruption of the genome as other GM technology, meaning that these interventions into the genome can lead to unpredictable and unexpected impacts on the performance and safety of crops.” Whatever the European commission decides will trigger considerable controversy. Most analysts expect either a company or an NGO to take legal action over the issue – which will end up being resolved at the European court of justice. The long struggle to legitimise the use of modern genetics on the farm goes on. Gene editing: should Britain embrace it? Yes Huw Jones, professor of translational genomics, Aberystwyth University Gene-editing tools such as Crispr have huge potential for research and for practical applications in healthcare and agriculture. This promise will be realised only if the European commission grasps the nettle and sets out a regulatory framework that is logical, proportionate to the risks and has broad support from the public, researchers and the plant-breeding industry. Basic gene editing makes mutations that are indistinguishable from those found in conventional breeding so it makes no sense to call these GMOs. Better to regulate them simply as “novel foods”. The commission has a unique opportunity to democratise biotechnology. It is currently dominated by a few multinational companies which, understandably, concentrate on profitable traits in the major global crops. Reducing overly burdensome costs and streamlining regulation for gene-edited plants with no foreign DNA would not only be logical, but allow smaller plant breeders and research organisations to use these benign methods for public-good breeding projects in locally important crops, and focus on less-profitable traits for sustainable agriculture and nutritional quality. We now have the editing tools to translate the wealth of available genomics information into safe and nutritious food. I urge the commission to stimulate democratic innovation in plant breeding by excluding simple gene editing from current GMO legislation. No Liz O’Neill, Director of GM Freeze If this group of genetic engineering techniques escape classification as GM, they could be completely unregulated. The crops they produce could find their way into our fields and on to our plates without environmental or food safety risk assessments. They would not be traceable and, without labelling, consumers would have no way to identify and avoid them should they wish to do so. We hear a lot about the precision of the new methods, but they are all vulnerable to off-target effects of one kind or another and precision isn’t the same as predictability. We know that genes interact with each other in complex ways. Changing the way that one gene is expressed can have an effect on a completely different part of the genome. So even if one is successful in altering DNA in exactly the way intended, unexpected effects can still occur. These techniques have no history of safe use and, because genetic pollution is almost impossible to “mop up”, any problems they do cause will be incredibly difficult to put right. GM Freeze wants our food to be produced responsibly, fairly and sustainably, and allowing these techniques to slip through the regulatory safety net on a legal technicality would do the exact opposite.",http://media.guim.co.uk/35f70d6a9559b02e000047ed37c6d6e36dc9f68d/0_0_5100_3061/500.jpg,0.05249726177437021
59,article,world/2016/feb/04/alert-theres-a-dangerous-new-viral-outbreak-zika-conspiracy-theories,World news,2016-02-04,Alert! There's a dangerous new viral outbreak: Zika conspiracy theories,https://gu.com/p/4gdhq,News,Alert! There's a dangerous new viral outbreak: Zika conspiracy theories,"<p>Most conspiracy theories are harmless, but rumours that GM mosquitoes may inadvertently have caused Brazil’s epidemic could potentially cost lives</p>",898,"Conspiracy theories are not unlike viruses. Mostly they circulate harmlessly on the fringes of society, but every now and then a mutation for increased transmissibility can lead to a mainstream outbreak with seriously damaging consequences in the real world. It’s ironic then that a conspiracy theory about a real virus - the Zika epidemic currently affecting Brazil - is currently exhibiting just such break-out behaviour. The first outing I can find came via an obscure post on Reddit on 25 January. The location should have rung warning bells: it was in a sub-Reddit category titled “conspiracies”, sandwiched between 9/11 truther rants, and was written anonymously under the giveaway pseudonym “redditsucksatbanning”. It alleged that the UK-based small company Oxitec, which began releasing genetically engineered male-sterile mosquitoes in 2011 in north-eastern Brazil in order to combat dengue disease, may have inadvertently caused the Zika outbreak. Oxitec’s approach involves releasing non-biting males - which have been genetically engineered to carry a gene that is lethal to their offspring - to mate with wild females. A scientific paper about the trials, conducted in the Brazilian city of Juazeiro in late 2011, confirmed that the local population of disease-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes crashed by more than 90% during the trial, making Oxitec’s approach a far more promising form of control than conventional insecticide spraying. Aedes mosquitoes carry both dengue and Zika, so the same strategy could help tackle both diseases. The Reddit post claimed to spot a correlation between the site of the GM mosquito releases and the location of the first Zika outbreaks in Brazil. This allegation was repeated on the fringe news site AntiMedia on 28 January, three days later. It included a handy map with a big red arrow indicating the mosquito release site in an area suspiciously close to the main Zika-affected sites. Oops. There are two cities called Juazeiro in Brazil, and AntiMedia’s big red arrow was pointing at the wrong one, as the myth-busting science blogger Christie Wilcox quickly spotted. The Juazeiro where the GM mosquito releases had actually taken place was 300km away. Both cities are in turn rather a long way from the main Zika outbreak areas, which are located on the coast. The timing was wrong too. Zika was first reported in Brazil in 2015, while the Oxitec mosquito releases began four years earlier. Moreover, Zika is thought to have come to Brazil from a 2013 outbreak in French Polynesia, which in turn spread from a 2007 outbreak in Micronesia. So the GM mosquitoes were effectively being blamed for causing a disease many thousands of miles away and several years before they were even released. Russia’s international channel RT - always keen to push anti-GMO memes in order to advance Putin’s war against the West - was next to push the story on 30 January, adding pseudo-expert quotes from anti-biotech campaigners next to a republication of the erroneous maps identifying the wrong Brazilian city as the site of the mosquito release. Next up was the Daily Mail, which picked up the story on 31 January. “Are scientists to blame for Zika virus?” it asked, in a typically suggestive rhetorical question. By then social media was beginning to buzz - friends of mine reported seeing the story posted on their Facebook timelines. It was then republished in further mutated form on 1 February by the environmental journalist Oliver Tickell, editor of the Ecologist website, under a new headline: “Pandora’s box: how GM mosquitos [sic] could have caused Brazil’s microcephaly disaster”. Tickell quoted an “expert”, Dr Mae Wan Ho, fresh with a new theory. Dr Ho proposed that the DNA sequence used in genetically engineering Oxitec’s mosquitoes might somehow have jumped into the Zika virus and caused it to mutate into a more pathogenic form. Sounds plausible? The article seems impressively technical, quoting Dr Ho waxing lyrical on “integrated transposon vectors” and other sciencey-sounding language. The Ecologist failed to note Dr Ho’s real credentials, however. She is a decades-long anti-GMO activist who today divides her time between pushing anti-vaccine misinformation about MMR, bizarre ideas about about mobile phones causing cancer, and pseudo-scientific woo about homeopathy and “holistic” Chinese medicine. Plus she made an elementary mistake: the mosquitoes couldn’t inadvertently insert additional DNA into the Zika virus genome, because Zika has no DNA - it’s an RNA virus. That’s a different type of molecule, Dr Ho. Moreover, the DNA sequence in question is 8400 bases long, almost as long as the entire Zika virus genome. Dr Ho’s purported mechanism is a biological impossibility and the Ecologist story is science fiction. The real-world damage this kind of nonsense can cause is serious. Oxitec’s GM mosquito approach could potentially shield millions of Brazilians not just from Zika but from dengue too. It could even protect the Rio Olympics. But this won’t be allowed to happen if the conspiracy theory continues to snowball: already the Brazilian authorities are delaying approval for Oxitec to scale up deployment. There are historical precedents too. Myths circulating in Nigeria severely hampered efforts to eradicate polio during the early 2000s. Worse, HIV/Aids denialism during the Mbeki government’s tenure in South Africa is estimated to have caused over 300,000 preventable deaths. Mbeki reportedly caught the Aids denial virus off the internet. I can only hope that no-one in the Brazilian government reads the Daily Mail or the Ecologist, or countless innocent lives may yet be lost.",http://media.guim.co.uk/8b7961c59da78458187744cc198325662cd275f4/0_387_6016_3612/500.jpg,0.06053252303252304

The best we can do now is cross our fingers and hope that they turn out to be relatively harmless</p>,945,"Campbell’s Soup, the definitive canned food company in American history, has decided to start indicating which ingredients in their products are genetically modified on the labels of its cans. This is a pretty big deal, it seems. The announcement sets Campbell’s in oppostion to such powerful companies as Monsanto, PepsiCo and Kellogg, which have long resisted calls to be more transparent about GMO ingredients in the face of persistent questions about possible effects they might have on human health and the environment. They’ve spent millions of dollars in lobbying efforts to defeat GMO-labeling ballot measures in states such as Oregon, Colorado, Washington and California. The food makers say that labeling would add unnecessary costs. Nevertheless, the labeling movement has gained ground in recent years, as the notion of organic sustainability has wormed its way into the public consciousness. Vermont became the first US state to require GMO labeling in 2014. Campbell’s willingness to label is, I suppose, good news. Greater transparency is generally better in all facets of life and society. At the same time, this particular step towards transparency feels like it’s coming about 20 years too late. At least for old hippies like me. I was infuriated back in 1992, when the FDA issued its decision allowing genetically altered vegetables to be sold unlabeled, indistinguishable from any others a consumer would find in the produce section at the market. I remember thinking this was one of the most flabbergasting decisions our government had made during my sentient lifetime. I was enraged, and ranted about it to anyone within earshot. That’s when I gave up on the prospect of living “purely” in a world that was changing faster than I could keep up with. Makes sense. I was 21 years old. (Sidenote: I have come to think that resignation is better, really. Purity is a stupid idea.) My basic stance was what Dr Michael W Fox, author of Superpigs and Wondercorn, a book about the ethics of biotechnology, told Molly O’Neill for a story she wrote about the issue for the New York Times. “The marketplace should be the voting booth where the public should be able to cast a ballot either in favor of eating whole, natural foods or in favor of eating gene-altered, analogue food.” If, as the Bush Administration has recommended, genetically altered food is not labeled, and the public is none the wiser, Dr. Fox reasons, how can the public vote? He also worries about what happens to the active nutrients, the vitamins and enzymes whose development is suspended along with the ripening process in some genetically altered tomatoes. He worries about the delicate biochemical relationship between the physiology of humans and the foods they eat that has evolved over ages. As things are, the onus is on food companies to ensure consumer safety. The FDA website provides valuable “guidance to the industry” under the heading “Voluntary Labeling Indicating Whether Foods Have or Have Not Been Derived from Genetically Engineered Plants”. Last year, you might remember, the big news in this field was about the introduction of genetically modified salmon into the market. A company with the perfect dystopian name of AquaAdvantage developed salmon that could grow to full maturity in half the time that it took normal salmon. This was the first time a GMO animal was available for sale, as opposed to vegetables. That got some antennas perking up. (Or, well, ears. Humans don’t have antennas growing out of their heads yet.) Though I think a lot of the attention was due to the fact that genetically-improved salmon brought to mind images from the 1995 Renny Harlin movie Deep Blue Sea, wherein a mishap in the process of genetically modifying sharks leads to supersize, hyper-intelligent sharks that threaten to destroy mankind. Those sharks were really scary! Remember when one of them ate Samuel L Jackson? God, I love that movie. ’Cause concerning what we’ve been eating, as opposed to what might be eating us, the damage is done. How many tomatoes have you eaten since 1992? How many dishes of pasta with tomato sauce made by big companies? How much ketchup have you dipped fries into? Did you ever read Henrik Ibsen’s An Enemy of the People? It’s a really interesting play about a scientific report that indicates that a town’s water supply is being slowly poisoned. What are the doctors’ responsibilities in such a situation? What about the politicians’? What about the business leaders’? (Come to think of it, a lot these same ideas were explored in Jaws. It bring up questions about our responsibilities to the truth and doing good in the world when the truth as we know it is so mutable and ephemeral. “A normally constituted truth lives, let us say, as a rule seventeen or eighteen, or at most twenty years,” Ibsen wrote in his play, “seldom longer.” We’ve been eating this stuff for 24 years already. The best we can do now is keep our fingers crossed and hope that genetically modified organisms turn out to be relatively harmless in light their scientific and/or economic benefits. Who knows, maybe the costs the big food companies save by not labeling genetically modified food can be invested into developing practices that are more sustainable in the long run? Maybe genetically engineered salmon will help us end starvation? And if, in a hundred years or so, human beings have skin tone the color of the pants rich people wear on Nantucket and breathe through gills that have opened up on our necks, well, maybe that won’t be any worse than the way we look and breathe today. And it worked for Kevin Costner in Waterworld.",https://media.guim.co.uk/5516910128e5877fdf4d3f82d5b02044cd6f3dac/0_0_3500_2101/500.jpg,0.12818836864889496

But there is another key piece to science, and that is the people who produce it. When we ignore these people – or omit key facts that cast researchers or their work in a negative light – we miss important stories. In October, I wrote a long piece about a plant scientist and prominent GMO advocate named Kevin Folta. Folta works at the University of Florida and researches plant genetics and small fruit crops, such as strawberries. At the time, he was also active in science communication, particularly with respect to GMOs. My piece covered, among other things, some questionable choices Folta had made as part of this scientific outreach. These included undisclosed ties to the biotech giant Monsanto, which were uncovered by a controversial FoI act request instigated by the anti-GMO group US Right to Know. Relevant, too, is the fact that Folta published a pseudonymous podcast, a platform he used to interview his peers – even going as far as covertly interviewing himself – about science, including GMOs. The reaction to the piece was swift and intense. I expected it; I’ve covered genetic engineering for a few years now and I’m familiar with the fights, which get nasty. But I found one trend particularly worrying. A vocal but small group of pro-biotech researchers and science writers told me that I was ruining their cause and silencing scientists by discouraging scientific outreach. Others called me anti-science. A few weeks after the story published, when Folta announced that he was taking a break from his outreach – specifically his blog, his podcast and his Twitter account, endeavors separate from his scientific research – I got angry messages demanding a response about my role in his departure. To me, this showed a twisted view of science journalism. Should political journalists stick to positive profiles of politicians? Should business writers only consider the positives from a company’s actions? Should those who write about literature ignore the intent of the pieces they cover? Of course not. And the same goes for science. This debate is nothing new. In a 2009 essay in Nature, Boyce Rensberger, the former director of the Knight Science Journalism Fellowship program at the MIT, traced the history of the field “from cheerleaders to watchdogs”. In the 1930s and 1940s, Rensberger wrote, science journalists sought to “persuade the public to accept science as the salvation of society”. Great emphasis was put “on the wonders of science and respect for scientists, rather than on any analysis of the work being done or any anticipation of its effects on society”. There are dangers to this approach. Take for example, as Rensberger did, William Laurence, a New York Times science reporter who was also on the US government’s payroll to write about the Manhattan Project. Laurence wrote positive accounts of the atomic bomb as a reporter as well as press releases for the government, and he called Japan’s reports of radiation sickness “propaganda”. For these efforts, he won a Pulitzer in 1946. Such conversations about science journalism and its proper role persist to this day. Part of the problem is a continued misunderstanding of what science journalism is, and how it differs from other forms of science communication. At its best science communication, like any nonfiction writing, tries to portray truth. Science communicators do this by explaining how a natural phenomenon works, or highlighting how scientists learned something new. But how that truth is portrayed – and what is included or left out – depends on the writer’s intentions. It’s a broad genre, says Dan Fagin, a science journalist and director of New York University’s Science, health &amp; environmental reporting program: “It’s really any kind of communicating of science, and that can have all sorts of agendas. It can encourage people to become scientists, or encourage scientists to talk about science, or encourage a particular policy, or advance the interests of whichever group is paying for the communication.” Science journalism is different. “Science journalism’s ultimate loyalty, when practiced properly, is to the closest possible depiction of reality, period,” Fagin says. “And no other agendas should interfere with that.” Science journalists may write about science, but it’s also our job to look beyond wonders, hypotheses and data. It is to look at the people doing the science and whether they have conflicts of interest, or trace where their money is coming from. It is to look at power structures, to see who is included in the work and who is excluded or marginalized, whether because of gender or race or any other identity. All these factors matter because they influence who has access to the production of science, and who has influence over its production. It matters, too, in cases like Folta’s – where readers deserve the full context of his scientific communication, including how he approached it and who supported it. “As journalists we fail to do justice to what science is by somehow artificially presenting it as an inhuman, dispassionate inquiry. It’s human. People make human decisions,” says Deborah Blum, a science journalist and current director of Knight Science Journalism Program at MIT. “And anyone who works in the process of science who is honest about that will say that. If we’re any good at what we do, we present science in a full human context.” This doesn’t mean science journalists are always gunning for scientists, or that every interview is a gotcha or fodder for an exposé. Most science journalists I’ve talked to were drawn to this work because they love science; some even used to be scientists and decided to leave the bench for the reporter’s notebook. But we should maintain our skepticism (a hard task, to balance skepticism with general delight) and shouldn’t gloss over misdeeds or questionable behavior. More worryingly, sweeping aside poor research or dubious activities can also erode the public’s trust in science. “If your goal as a writer is to get people to question their assumptions and grapple with the world as it really exists, and not as they want it to exist, then doing things like hiding your affiliations or writing a piece in support of someone without acknowledging that you have a previous public or personal relationship is going to make it harder for people to understand the world as it is,” says Seth Mnookin, associate director of the graduate program in science writing at MIT. All this isn’t to say that science communication – and specifically science advocacy or activism, with all its agendas – is inherently bad. But the intentions of the writer should be clear. “My opinion remains that reality matters no matter how complicated it may be,” says Andrew Revkin, a writer whose blog, Dot Earth, shifted from news to the opinion section at the New York Times in 2010 and who teaches environmental communications at Pace University. “To me, it’s all about transparency. If you have an agenda, state your agenda,” he adds. “And if you’re claiming to be objective, then demonstrate the objectivity.” Our media ecosystem blurs these distinctions even more, with bylines of both journalists and advocates appearing at the same media outlets. “There are a lot more voices, and it is a lot more confusing to all of us who the advocates are and who the independent journalists,” says Kelly McBride, vice-president of academic programs at the Poynter Institute. Regardless of this blurring, the fact remains that the production of scientific knowledge thrives on criticism and debate – look no further than the peer review process and the dreaded, though perhaps mythical, third reviewer who is notoriously harsh or the heated conversations in the Q&amp;A sessions at scientific conferences for proof.

Much to the annoyance of opponents of genetically engineered foods, the FDA did not require AquaBounty, the Massachusetts-based company that developed the fish, to label the salmon as a lab creation. In a draft guideline on labeling genetically engineered salmon, the FDA reasoned that there is no material difference between the genetically engineered salmon and its run-of-the-mill cousins, but it dropped rather heavy hints regarding voluntary labeling, even suggesting specific wording that avoids the demonized letters “GMO” in favor of terms like “bioengineering” or “modern biotechnology”. Nevertheless, AquaBounty has said it has no plan to label its fish. This is a mistake, for both the company and for consumers. Labeling is a zombie issue, one that refuses to die and serves as a proxy for ongoing food ideology battles over products ranging from genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, to certified organic food. Before Congress approved its $1.1tn spending bill last Friday, agricultural industry groups pushed hard (albeit unsuccessfully) for a provision that would block state labeling laws. Of course, groups who opposed genetically engineered food pushed back just as hard. The bill, which Obama has signed into law, does require the FDA to forbid any sale of genetically engineered salmon until it finalizes its labeling guideline. But, since the bill will sunset in September 2016, and AquaBounty has said it could take two years to set up commercial production, the ban is unlikely to affect its business. On the day that the FDA announced its approval of the salmon, Tamar Haspel, a food columnist for the Washington Post, appealed to AquaBounty for voluntary labeling. “If the fish has all the advantages the company claims it does, say it loud. And let everyone – pro and con – vote with their wallets,” she said. On the surface at least, there’s a lot to recommend AquaBounty’s salmon. It’s genetically engineered to grow to market size faster than wild or conventionally farmed salmon. Its feed conversion ratio, the amount of fish food that is converted to meat, is around 10% better than its non-engineered cousins, so it uses up fewer resources. It is also reared in land-based production facilities in Canada and Panama, which are a better option than the awful, ecologically damaging sea pens where most farmed salmon are raised. Critics say that genetically engineered fish could threaten the wild salmon population if they escape into a nearby stream. AquaBounty’s fish are unlikely to escape from their indoor tanks, and the company says that it only grows sterile female fish. And, even if a genetically engineered, non-sterile fish manages to get into a nearby stream, it won’t likely pose a threat to the wild population. Research has shown that salmon with the growth gene are less successful at mating than wild salmon. Assuming all the protective measures are sound – and AquaBounty would be shooting itself in the foot if they weren’t – the company’s salmon really does seem like a sound ecological food choice. But Haspel’s suggestion that the fish could therefore be labeled in a positive way didn’t fit into the well-worn narrative of the debate, in which environmentalists who oppose genetically modified food line up to attack the biotech industry and both sides view labels as warning signs. The debate is about both the wording and the concern that consumers would see any label as a warning. But the beauty of voluntary labeling is that companies can choose what they want to say, as long as it is not false or misleading. For example, a label could say that the fish is “produced using biotechnology to have a lower environmental impact than conventional farmed salmon”. Voluntary labeling also circumvents a key complaint from opponents of mandatory labels: that government intervention implies there is something to be worried about. It does not seem so far-fetched that some consumers would want to buy genetically engineered foods, and would need labels to make that choice. In that context, it’s somewhat annoying that AquaBounty is unwilling to allow people to choose. Given that it spent 20 years waiting for regulatory approval, it’s easy to see why the company is concerned about consumer rejection. But unless it does something to address public criticism, it will continue to face opposition. Already, numerous grocery chains, including Costco, Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, Aldi, Target, Kroger and Safeway have pledged not to stock the fish. Yet, as Nathanael Johnson points out in a piece for Grist, an environmental news site, labeling is a way for companies to show that they respect the feelings of their customers. “Companies should respond to ignorance by providing more information, not less. They should dispel fear by making the unknown known.” AquaBounty is not alone in this debate. Other companies with genetically engineered products have been equally label-shy. J R Simplot’s new potatoes, which are designed to resist bruising, should be making their way to the store shelves any day now. In this case, genetic engineering could reduce the amount of potatoes that are tossed away by farmers and consumers because of their blemishes. Yet Simplot only mentions the word “biotechnology” on its website, not in the packaging. For these companies, media attention is a distraction from their mission – selling fish and potatoes. But the AquaBounty salmon in particular has become a rallying point for mandatory labeling proponents, and the decision to not to label has kept attention firmly fixed on the company. So please, AquaBounty, for the sake of all of us who want to move on from this stagnant debate: label the fish.",,0.049484554993029575
63,article,sustainable-business/2015/dec/11/monsanto-hugh-grant-gmo-food-ethical-business-csr,Guardian Sustainable Business,2015-12-11,Can Monsanto's CEO move the debate about GMOs beyond good versus evil?,https://gu.com/p/4epzp,,Can Monsanto's CEO move the debate about GMOs beyond good versus evil?,<p>Hugh Grant talks to the Guardian’s Marc Gunther about the agribusiness giant’s two-front war for a sustainable food supply</p>,1218,"“You have an easy job,” I tell Hugh Grant, the CEO of Monsanto, as we sit down at the W Hotel in New York City. He looks puzzled, so I explain: “I just read on the Internet that Monsanto controls the world’s food supply.” Grant, 57, jokes that it’s all effortless. The idea that Monsanto controls the world’s food is a canard, but there’s no doubt that it’s a major player in the food chain. The St Louis-based agribusiness giant produced 35.5% of the corn seeds and 28% of the soybean seeds planted in the US in 2014, with sales topping $15.8bn last year. Success hasn’t been easy: the agriculture business is competitive, and farmers are constantly looking for ways to increase yields, says Grant, who has been with Monsanto for 34 years. “We have to win their business every year.” Monsanto has become a favorite target for opponents of genetically modified organisms, or GMOs. Food and Water Watch, for example, has created a webpage titled Five Things Monsanto Doesn’t Want You to Know About GMOs. It argues that GMOs have failed to live up to their hype, require more chemical use than comparable non-GMO plants and have been insufficiently researched and studied. In the battle between Monsanto and its critics, the US grocery industry has been caught in the crossfire. To respond to demands for transparency, food brands have just announced an initiative called Smart Label, that will enable consumers to learn more about what goes into their food – including whether ingredients were genetically modified. This comes just a couple of weeks after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first genetically-engineered animal intended for food, a fast-growing farmed Atlantic salmon. “I look forward to tasting some,” Grant says. GMOs and climate change The issue of climate change and GMOs is timely. While I was meeting with Grant in New York, the US Department of Agriculture released a new scientific assessment of “the risks that climate change poses to global food security and the challenges facing farmers and consumers in adapting to changing climate conditions”. Monsanto is working on two fronts in the climate wars: mitigation and adaptation. In terms of the first goal, it announced last week that it would make its operations carbon neutral by 2021. Part of this mitigation will involve encouraging farmers to plant cover crops and practice no-till or low-till agriculture, which enriches soil and releases less CO2 than full tilling. Monsanto plans to publicize its results, share best practices and encourage others to improve on its techniques. “As the years go by we’ll get smarter,” Grant says. He’d eventually like to see farmers of arable crops get paid in the form of carbon offsets for sequestering CO2, just as forestry projects do. Adaptation, meanwhile, is underway in both the US and the developing world. For example, since 2012, Monsanto has been selling a drought-tolerant biotech corn seed to farmers – mostly in the western US – who are struggling with drier weather that has been attributed to climate change. “Trying to find drought tolerance through traditional breeding has been elusive,” Grant says. Feeding the world But what about farmers most in need? Critics say that the big seed companies have not done enough to help farmers in the developing world. Grant doesn’t disagree, but he says that regulations and tradition have kept not only genetically modified crops but hybrid seed out of much of Africa. “Where does it get warm first? Where does it get dusty first?” he asks. “The cruel irony is that the places that need these technologies the most are the most vulnerable to climate change.” What Grant doesn’t say – he doesn’t have to – is that most African farmers are too poor to be a source of substantial profits to big global biotech firms. Nevertheless, Monsanto has developed drought-tolerant hybrid seeds for white maize, a staple grown mostly by smallholder farmers that is made into porridge in Africa and tortillas in Mexico. It’s a philanthropic effort, which the company has undertaken in partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Howard G. Buffett Foundation, US AID, African governments and AATF, an African NGO. Early results are promising. Critics – including the Guardian’s John Vidal – question whether the US should export its agricultural methods to Africa. But Grant notes that, while US corn farmers generate yields of 150 to 160 bushels per acre, farmers in Brazil, Mexico and India get about 100 bushels per acre and those in Africa produce only about 20 bushels. There’s enormous room for improvement in Africa, he says. This brings us to the feed-the-world argument that is central to Monsanto’s messaging. With a growing global population and an emerging middle class in China and India, the world is going to need a lot more food, Grant says. And he’s not the only person making this prediction: the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN has estimated that we need to grow 60% more food by 2050. “We need to produce more on less land and use less stuff, stuff meaning fertilizer and water,” Grant says. Precision agriculture, cover crops, drip irrigation and a “more intimate knowledge of microbes in soil” will all help, he says, adding that biotech will also be an essential tool. Changing the way we eat Others argue that there are better ways to address the problem of food security. About one-third of all the food produced for consumption is wasted, the UN Environment Programme says. Producing meat is more resource intensive than growing vegetables. In other words, growing corn and soy to feed to livestock is wasteful because those crops can feed more people directly. The same is true for growing corn to produce ethanol. The demand for more crops wouldn’t be as great if more people adopted plant-based diets or reduced their beef consumption. “It’s true that if we cut back on food waste, that would help, and it’s true if we all ate less meat, that would help,” Grant says. But all the evidence, he argues, indicates that people in the developing world want to eat more meat, not less. About GMOs, Grant would like to see the debates become more science-based: “Everybody’s got an opinion. A lot of people don’t have facts. Absent the facts, it’s a very confusing conversation,” he says. He’s hoping that the decision by brands to disclose information about food products – including whether they contain GMOs – by using barcodes and websites will satisfy demands for transparency about GMOs. But critics are already saying that barcodes will be of little or no help to the elderly, the poor and people without smartphones. Grant says he has no problem with consumers who prefer to avoid genetically engineered foods, or farmers who prefer to grow organic crops. Outside our hotel window is the Union Square farmers market, where even on a drizzly day New Yorkers line up to buy local and organic produce. Some packaged food companies are struggling even as organic foods and food carrying the non-GMO label are rapidly growing their sales. Is this a concern for Monsanto? “I have no problem with it, whatsoever,” Grant says. It’s the polarization of the debate about food that frustrates him. “I’d love to see us get to a point where it’s not an either/or. It’s an and.”",https://media.guim.co.uk/c2297bee3c62e8db85e1294be203aca7e1f1319f/0_90_3504_2103/500.jpg,0.1514395878912008

But the experts made clear that altering the DNA of human embryos for clinical purposes was unacceptable given the unknown risks today and noted that even the most compelling cases to use the procedure were limited. The international summit in Washington was organised by the national academies of the US, UK and China to take stock of powerful new tools that can make precision changes to the code of life, by correcting, removing and adding DNA to an organism’s genome. One gene editing technique, known as Crispr-Cas9, is so simple to use that the number of experiments using it in labs around the world has increased dramatically in the past two years. The rapid adoption of the powerful tool prompted scientists to gather at the summit and thrash out guidelines for its responsible use in the future. The statement from the organising committee follows three days of discussion among scientists, lawyers and ethics experts, who considered: the potential for therapies in adult tissues, such as blood cells and muscles; the ethics of modifying embryos for research only; and most importantly whether altering the DNA of human embryos to prevent inherited diseases was acceptable and useful. Earlier this year, the UK parliament voted to allow a procedure called mitochondrial transfer in human embryos, an experimental therapy that aims to prevent rare genetic diseases from being passed on from mother to child. The law forbids any other form of genetic modification of embryos, unless it is for research only, in which case the donated embryos must be destroyed after 14 days. In principle, gene editing could be used to prevent couples from passing on a genetic disorder to their children. If the genetic fault is known early on, the couple could have IVF to create embryos and have the faulty genes corrected at that stage. But so-called germline therapy affects not only the unborn child, but his or her future generations. If the procedure causes unexpected harm, undoing the damage may not be straightforward. Outlining their position, the summit committee said: “It would be irresponsible to proceed with any clinical use of germline editing unless and until the relevant safety and efficacy issues have been resolved, based on appropriate understanding and balancing of risks, potential benefits, and alternatives, and there is broad societal consensus about the appropriateness of the proposed application.” Critics of germline therapy argue that any couple at risk of passing on a genetic disorder to their children could avoid the outcome by going through IVF and having their embryos screened for problematic genes, by using donated sperm or eggs, or adopting. Future uses could see germline editing used to lower people’s chances of developing Alzheimer’s disease and other conditions by removing high risk genes. The committee recommended scientists push ahead with gene editing for other therapies that would not affect future generations. The tool may one day help scientists correct the genes that cause sickle-cell anaemia in blood cells, and improve the ability of the immune system to attack cancer cells. But even this work had potential dangers, the statement cautioned. “There is a need to understand the risks, such as inaccurate editing, and the potential benefits of each proposed genetic modification,” it says. Paul Knoepfler, a cell biologist at the University of California, Davis, and author of the forthcoming GMO Sapiens: The Life-changing Science of Designer Babies, said that while he agreed with the need for more basic research and progress towards therapies in adult tissues, he hoped for a stronger line on changes to human embryos for clinical purposes. “I’m disappointed that the organisers did not propose at least a temporary moratorium on germline human genetic modification,” he told the Guardian. “It’s not clear to me what the downside of a temporary moratorium would have been. “Several of the organisers clearly and in some cases strongly advocated for a ‘pause’ in germline editing in the last few months. What changed? I don’t believe that stating that germline human editing attempts would be irresponsible – although I think that is true – is strong enough.” The committee conceded that safety issues have not been well explored and that many countries have legal or regulatory bans on germline modification. But it added that the question of whether it should be allowed should be reconsidered at future meetings. “As scientific knowledge advances and societal views evolve, the clinical use of germline editing should be revisited on a regular basis,” the statement read.",https://media.guim.co.uk/9cef4f62c7abbc9aabb049c8beb1d173d8d44b5b/0_287_3890_2334/500.jpg,0.08339277871886568
65,article,science/political-science/2015/nov/19/lamar-smith-harassing-climate-scientists,Science,2015-11-19,The House Science Committee Chair is harassing climate scientists,https://gu.com/p/4ebxx,News,The House Science Committee Chair is harassing US climate scientists,<p>Lamar Smith has targeted government climate change researchers with a subpoena that demands all their notes and correspondence relating to a recent study<br></p>,777,"If you don’t like a particular scientific study, attack the scientists who produced it. It’s a tried and true method of manufacturing controversy around inconvenient scientific analysis. And now, Lamar Smith, Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, is using the sledgehammer of a congressional subpoena to bully National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) scientists for their research on climate change. At issue is a paper published in Science earlier this year by NOAA scientists contradicting claims that the rate of global warming had recently slowed. The NOAA study is based on routine updates NOAA made to its surface temperature dataset, one of the many datasets that experts use to measure how fast the climate is changing. Scientists in many fields update datasets all the time to correct for differences in measurement techniques and to add new information. Multiple subsequent scientific papers derived from other data corroborate the NOAA scientists’ conclusions. Chairman Smith, who has consistently dismissed mainstream climate science, sought more information about the study. NOAA scientists provided three separate briefings to Science Committee staff in July and September, answering questions about the research and directing staffers to the data and methodology, all of which was already publicly available. This is all anyone should need to assess the science. Yet on October 13, Chairman Smith issued a broad subpoena to NOAA demanding all correspondence, notes, peer review comments, paper drafts, and more among scientists from the last seven years related to this work. Notably, Smith now has unilateral power to issue subpoenas without the consent of committee Democrats, making the process more vulnerable to politicization. We have seen subpoenas for confidential medical data from the Environmental Protection Agency and undue scrutiny of individual National Science Foundation grants. Reaction to the latest power grab was swift and harsh. Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, the committee’s ranking Democrat, sent a scathing letter condemning the actions as “illegitimate harassment.” The American Meteorological Society echoed this sentiment in its own letter to Chairman Smith. Factcheck.org found that the chairman had made “several inaccurate or misleading claims about climate science” in the course of his investigation. Chairman Smith’s response to the criticism was to double down, mischaracterizing the updating of datasets as “altering data” and scheduling recorded interviews—effectively depositions—with NOAA staff. He has since appealed to the Secretary of Commerce to compel NOAA to comply with his demand. So far, NOAA has stood its ground, rightly refusing to turn over the scientists’ correspondence. “Because the confidentiality of these communications among scientists is essential to frank discourse among scientists, those documents were not provided to the Committee,” NOAA told Inside Climate News. This isn’t the first time that private companies and public officials have tried to access the correspondence of scientists whose research poses a threat to their interests. In what was widely seen as a witch hunt, former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli used a Medicare fraud law to unsuccessfully subpoena the personal correspondence of climate scientists. British Petroleum used subpoenas to access the correspondence of scientists who volunteered their expertise to fix the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster. Coal industry-funded organizations and anti-GMO activists have used open records laws to try to find material that could be used to discredit researchers. Congress using this tactic takes it to a new level. Although none of these investigations found any scientific misconduct, they did waste time and resources and sowed confusion. Some argue that because federal government salaries are taxpayer-funded, the public should have access to scientists’ private conversations. But reasonable people don’t expect government attorneys to hand over the materials they exchange with their clients. They don’t expect members of Congress to turn over their own notes and emails either. No one can work in a climate where every email, meeting record or handwritten note could be publicly scrutinized and taken out of context. Scientists enter government service to serve the public interest. Their research provides vital information to businesses and farmers and elected officials to grow our economy and protect the health and safety of our communities. But to do this they need the ability to collaborate freely with colleagues and experts inside and outside government, without fear of a congressional subpoena for politically unpopular research results. We’re stronger, healthier and more prosperous because we grant scientists independence to go where the data leads them. NOAA should continue to stand strong against actions that would undermine the independence of its scientists and compromise our ability to make policy decisions informed by independent science.

Or at least it was, before it was genetically modified for capabilities far beyond its own. Since E coli’s natural habitat – the darkness of the human intestine – doesn’t warrant light sensitivity, a sensor is added. Another upgrade instructs the bacteria to excrete an enzyme to stain the dish’s agar solution black when hit by light. The image itself is captured through a negative putting only the lit-up bacteria to work – the brighter the light, the darker the spot – and voilà: about a day later, a bacterial photograph. Welcome to the strange world of biohacking, where enthusiasts push the boundaries for life as we know it. Flanagan, the mastermind behind the artworks, hopes to dispel fears still surrounding germs and DIY biology. “There’s still the idea that bacteria are evil, that bacteria makes you sick,” he says. In jeans and a wool sweater over a shirt, the blue latex gloves he wears is to protect the organisms from humans, rather than the other way around. “With the wrong set of circumstances and the wrong bacteria, its true: they can make you sick. But that’s almost like saying that all Americans are bad because some small fraction break laws and do bad things.” Flanagan’s portfolio, kept in a small laboratory refrigerator, includes several portraits and a unicorn: this is GMO at its cutest. He doesn’t think of himself as an artist, but finds that the pictures help demystify to outsiders what he does for a living. ••• For the next generation of hackers, microorganisms have become the new hardware, and DNA strands the new software. Think of E coli as an iPhone, explains Flanagan, onto which you can install a never-ending variety of apps (in this case, designer genomes). The possibilities are limitless: in theory, organisms can be programmed to do just about anything – there are lifesaving pharmaceuticals, self-repairing concrete, glowing plants and synthetic saffron – and for the biohacking community, tapping into their revolutionary potential has become a perceived democratic right. The technology is already becoming accessible to just about anyone. Much like Moore’s law for computers, the cost of sequencing DNA has fallen exponentially: in 2001, a million letters – base pairs – cost $100,000; today it’s around 10 cents. As one physicist put it, the domestication of biotechnology will dominate our lives for the next 50 years at least as much as the domestication of computers did during the previous 50. Had Bill Gates grown up today, he told Wired, he’d be hacking biology instead of computers. In Brooklyn, science, like so many other things, has become artisanal. Behind an anonymous steel door in Fort Greene is Genspace: a fully functional molecular biology lab, complete with exposed brick walls, a cricket terrarium and inspirational Aldous Huxley quotes. This is the first nonprofit community lab in the US. In the freelance era, scientists need incubators and co-working spaces, too. Behind bumper-stickered glass doors, wearing a hoodie over a SXSW T-shirt, Ellen Jorgensen, molecular biologist, TED-talker and Genspace’s founding member, instructs the Biohacker Boot Camp. “Real innovation and creativity is very difficult to achieve when someone else is deciding what the purpose of your work is,” explains Jorgensen. “Here, no one is going to ask you if your project is worthy, or if it’s going to make money, or if it’s going to save the world.” After a clip art-illustrated PowerPoint crash course in molecular biology, her students swab the insides of their cheeks, placing their samples in test tubes to boil and centrifuge until their DNA strands are separated and ready for analysis, to reveal anything from ancestry to disease predisposition. Community labs such as Genspace have mushroomed up across the US. In 2011 a $35,000 campaign opened the doors of Biocurious, “a hackerspace for biotech” and beyond. What began as a Google group, with threads such as “Your opinion on reviving extinct species?”, became a movement. Much of it snowballed from an MIT initiative: the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM), a nonprofit organization and annual competition in biohacking projects ranging from bacterial sunscreen to vegan cow cheese. It opened to the public after popular demand and became the world’s largest synthetic biology community. This year, 280 teams from all continents entered, with Genspace’s team awarded first prize for a custom-made fluorescent organism to monitor the neighborhood’s beloved but outrageously polluted Gowanus canal. Biohackers are an eclectic community, united in utopian goals of providing an alternative to Big Science, ridding itself from the red tapes, patents and the monopolies of academia and industrial labs. In true hacker spirit, they preach open data, build low-cost laboratory equipment and off-the-shelf protocols. Earlier this year, a team of biohackers announced Open Insulin, a crowd-funded campaign to provide a generic, accessible alternative to patented, expensive diabetes drugs. “We have no quarrel with Big Science; we merely recall that Small Science has always been just as critical to the development of the body of human knowledge, and we refuse to see it extinguished,” says the Biopunk Manifesto. “Who are the 20th century equivalents of Benjamin Franklin, Edward Jenner Marie Curie or Thomas Edison?” it asks, noting the troubling decline in citizen science. With a streak of anti-establishment at heart, perhaps DIYbio was bound to be controversial. In the early days, headlines painted doomsday scenarios: were community labs “playing God” creating the next bioweapon? Could engineered organisms escape into the wild, Jurassic Park-style? Could the US president’s DNA be hacked for a personalized bioweapon (yes, really)? Biohackers worldwide remember the tragedy of Steve Kurtz: an arts professor arrested on suspicions of bioterrorism as he called 911 after his wife died of a heart attack and petri dishes with bacteria were found in their New York house during a raid by dozens of agents in hazmat suits. Kurtz was only allowed to return home a week later, declared innocent and not a threat to public safety. Insisting that fears are dramatically overstated, Genspace has come a long way in reversing negative perceptions. As part of the charm offensive, the lab opens its doors for the public at least once a month, for the PCR + pizza night, where newbies are invited to identify plant samples or isolate DNA from their saliva. Genspace adheres to the Center for Disease Control’s Biosafety Level 1, working only with benign organisms (indeed, the strand of E coli used isn’t the one that causes stomach issues). “If you’re working with pathogens, you’re not part of the biohacker community, you’re part of bioterrorist community,” explains Jorgenson. Meredith L Patterson, author of the Biopunk manifesto, puts it more crudely: ”It’s a hell of a lot easier to learn to fly a 747 than it is to learn how to engineer a pathogen.” But the promise of a grassroots bio-revolution still brings some unease: in 2013, a wildly successful crowd-funding campaign which received $484,013 promised to distribute seeds of engineered glow-in-the-dark plants. It provoked outrage (and a Kickstopper campaign) from environmental groups. Earlier this year, a UN report on synthetic biology warned it may adversely impact biodiversity and small-scale agriculture. FlanaGen is undeterred, however: the benefits far offset risks. “Most people have internet, but most people don’t hack banks,” says Shindel, laughing at the idea of accidentally opening Pandora’s box for the next Frankenstein (“We have enough trouble keeping single cell organisms alive!”) Like all technology, synthetic biology is subject to the “dual usage” paradox – everything can be used for good and evil. “I think in 150, 200 years when people look back at synthetic biology, they will do it in the same way we look at electricity. They’ll take it for granted.” Flanagan continues the analogy: electricity is dangerous too, but when his family house burnt down in an electrical fire a few years ago, they didn’t go off-the-grid and “move into a cave”. Benjamin Franklin probably encountered skepticism too, Flanagan says, but where would we be today if he had listened to them? “This is about being on the right side of history. This is inevitable.

Ever since The Population Bomb, the 1968 bestseller by serial-Chicken-Little and anti-natalist Paul Ehrlich, warning that four billion would die of starvation by the end of the 1980s, and the Club of Rome’s 1972 report Limits to Growth that predicted civilizational “overshoot and collapse” within decades, neo-Malthusians have been telling us we need to degrow the economy and retreat from a Western, consumerist, high-technology, unsustainable way of life, or else Hobbesian doom is all but a fortnight away. Updated for the era of the genuinely exacting challenge of global warming and biodiversity loss, a retreat from economic growth is argued to be necessary today because “We cannot have infinite growth on a finite planet”. Yet all this talk of “we” in the developed world (or, as some hair-shirt wags put it, we in the over-developed world), of “our” overconsumption, of an undifferentiated mass of big spenders, ignores the billowingly large class differences that exist in the global north and the decades-long bludgeoning of workers’ standard of living. Throughout the post-war period of powerful trade unions, full employment and a strong welfare state that the French nostalgically call Les Trente Glorieuses, workers’ pay across the West rose in tandem with growth. But since that time, wages and benefits have stagnated or declined in most sectors. If the median US household income had kept pace with the broader economy since 1970, it would now be $92,000 instead of $50,000. From 1990 to 2009, labour’s share of national income declined in twenty-six out of thirty developed economies, according to the OECD. Overall across advanced economies, labour’s share dropped from 66.1 percent to 61.7 percent. And as poor as many are in the developing world, the gap between them and the workers of the global north is less than the gap between the latter and the one percent. That is to say: us ordinary folks in the supposed rich countries are closer in wealth and have far more in common with third-world workers than we do with our own bosses. So who exactly is this “we” that is doing all the overconsuming? Almost everyone I know is just struggling to get by. We don’t need the “Buy Nothing Days” of the trendy anti-consumerist Adbusters magazine, but rather some “Finally-Able-to-Buy-Lots-More Days”. Humans are not like bacteria in a petri dish or a cartoon hamster that gets fatter and fatter until it is a 9-billion-tonne burping, growling Godzilla-rodent, careening through cities eating everything in its path, as a video on from the New Economics Foundation would suggest. Unlike any other species, our per capita rate of material and energy throughput alters as a result of changes in technology and our political economy. Through technological advance, we can use less of something to produce the same amount, or replace one raw material with another. We didn’t “run out” of whale blubber. We replaced it with kerosene. It is true that the right-wing Pollyannas say: “Don’t bother your pretty little head; technology will save us.” The green left Cassandras meanwhile run around screaming: “Technology can’t save us; we’re doomed!” The socialist meanwhile says: “So long as we plan and regulate the economy carefully, we need never run out of anything, no matter how large we grow.” It is not growth, but unfettered free markets that are the problem. Capitalism depends on growth, but growth does not depend on capitalism. Naomi Klein’s jumbling together of the two says more about the contemporary left’s atrophying knowledge of the ABCs of socialist economics than it does about the problem that the current mode of production poses to ecological services. Over the past decade, greens in the European Parliament have repeatedly provided an environmentalist fig leaf to the further privatization and break-up of energy utilities, out of a desire to give independent producers of renewable energy access to the electricity grid. But in the UK, community-owned alternative energy projects represent just five percent of capacity compared to 82 percent represented by private home-owners. Feed-in-tariffs (FiTs) are effectively a subsidy of the middle-class by the poor. They offer subsidies to property owners and companies to install solar panels and wind turbines, with the considerable cost passed on as a surcharge to the utility consumers. In Germany, where FITs are most developed, they have made electricity the most expensive in Europe. The average household now pays an extra €260 a year, while 2,300 energy-intensive companies are exempt from paying the surcharge—and these costs are only expected to rise. And after Berlin began shutting down its nuclear plants, they had to open new plants powered by lignite coal in order to keep the lights on because the sun does not always shine and the wind does not always blow. The country’s carbon emissions have predictably begun to creep back up. Yet this need not be the case. We know now that the main historic concerns about nuclear power are not the worry we once thought they were, in the case of radiation and waste, or a phenomenon that next-generation reactor technology eliminates completely, in the case of meltdown. The number of deaths per terawatt hour from nuclear power even with existing technology is by far the lowest of all energy sources. Nuclear should also be cheap. But some 70-80 percent of its cost is due to substantial up-front construction costs, which take decades to pay off, and make the private sector extremely reluctant to go anywhere near the technology without significant public subsidies. In the US in the 1970s, the private companies that were involved in the American build-out of nuclear saw their finances deteriorate due to mammoth cost overruns and had to hand over significant authority to public utility commissions. Over roughly the same period, France, Sweden and Belgium underwent the most successful and rapid decarbonisation programmes in history. France now produces 78 percent of its electricity from this low-carbon source, and enjoyed reductions in emissions of four percent a year over the course of just a decade. The key to France’s nuclear success was making the transition prior to the advent of neoliberalism in the 1980s. Consistently, energy policy researchers have found that the essential element was France’s muscular étatist framework that permitted centralised decision making; a public-sector electricity monopoly enjoying substantial, concentrated resources (the state engineers of the Corps d’État); and strong political support. Alongside this was an influential public research and development agency, and economies of scale from standardised and large-scale build-out. All this is necessary—just as in the Manhattan Project or the Apollo missions—due to high levels of technological risk, reliance on advanced equipment that requires a lengthy lead time, complex learning, a non-proprietorial attitude to knowledge-sharing, and, above all, large amounts of cheap capital. This is precisely why the strongest backers of nuclear power advocate that, for the time being, it cannot be anything other than public sector driven, and why some of the fiercest opponents of nuclear power are, surprisingly, free-market think-tanks such as the Cato Institute. The scale of public investment, centralization, and regulatory control that is required means nuclear smells too much like socialism. But if it were up to the likes of them, we’d never have landed on the moon. An entrepreneurial, risk-taking, mission-oriented public sector got us into space, and it’ll be the same sort of public sector that saves the planet. The patchwork of hair-shirted, back-to-the-land, anti-industrial and degrowth prescriptions common on the green left should really be described as “eco-austerity”. Green anti-modernism is a cuckoo’s egg in the nest of the left. The truth is that we can stop climate change and deliver expanding wealth for all. The end is not nigh and we do not need to rein in industrial society. If anything, we must accelerate our modernity.

Here are five recent scientific developments that will have an enormous impact on the way people eat. The WHO v red meat The World Health Organisation announced last week that processed meats were now considered category 1 carcinogens alongside alcohol and cigarettes, but it’s the footnote to that story that will have bigger consequences for the future of our diets. It labelled all red meat a category 2A carcinogen, and from the WHO that is BIG. All the commercials we grew up with touting the iron content and health benefits of lean red meat aren’t going to be quite the same if they have to add “and will probably give you cancer” at the end. Health-conscious paleo dieters may even want to rethink their obsession with grass-fed beef, or risk prioritising their summer beach bodies over avoiding bowel cancer. For most of us (myself included), the taste of a good steak or chop is enough to make us not worry too much about ill health effects, but still, after decades of red meat clawing its way into first-world life as an everyday food, the case against it is building faster than ever. The fat taste Say hello to oleogustus. That’s the proposed name for the “fat taste” that looks set to be added to salt, sweet, sour, bitter and umami to take the number of basic human tastes to six. The idea that humans can taste fat may seem straightforward, but most of what we associate with fat is its texture or aroma. That most of us can taste it without those other aspects is a big deal. Oleogustus gives us the delicious, morish taste of butter and it helps us tell if oils have turned rancid. Still not impressed? Well, the last time we added to our list of basic tastes was more than 100 years ago, when Japanese scientist Kikunae Ikeda discovered umami, the savoury “fifth taste” that revolutionised the food industry from potato chips to stock cubes. Oleogustus probably won’t be as revolutionary as umami, but it might lead to better-tasting butter, or more convincing natural or artificial flavours. It might give us richer, creamier-tasting milk, or even Willy Wonka-esque pills that taste like a three-course dinner. Your microbiome If you’ve ever felt not quite yourself, it might be because, scientifically speaking, you’re actually not. Everyone carries around billions of bacterial cells in their stomach and intestines – some bad, but many good – and these cells substantially outnumber our own human ones. Together they are known as our microbiome, and there’s a growing consensus in science that they plays an enormous role in our health. Irrespective of how healthy we try to be, our microbiome may be responsible for whether we are skinny or fat, how prone we are to diabetes, or our food allergies. A course of antibiotics you took as a child to fix a simple lurgy might have inadvertently knocked about your gut bacteria and set you up for a lifetime of weight gain and health problems. The more important the microbiome becomes, the less we will want bacteria-killing preservatives, and we will probably want to return to more traditional fermented foods common in relatively healthy countries such as Japan and Korea. It may even mean a huge boom in supercharged probiotics. Imagine a daily glass of bacteria-filled milk that could help you lose weight or manage serious illnesses such as diabetes or heart disease. GMO safety Since their introduction to our food systems in 1996, genetically modified organisms have been controversial. Most opposition has been around the idea that we don’t know enough about the long terms effects of GMOs to consider them safe. In late 2014, a study at the University of California, Davis, analysed 29 years of data from more than 100 billion livestock animals eating trillions of meals of GMO feed. It broadly concluded that GMO feed was safe and nutritionally identical to non-GMO feed. Of course this was not a study on humans, but up to 90% of GMOs produced are used as animal feed, so it is hugely relevant. The study further suggested there were no adverse affects from humans who consumed meat and other products from the GMO-fed animals. Whether you consider this to be conclusive proof that GMOs are safe or not, it’s a huge step towards eroding the fear that we don’t know enough about them. This may make it less likely that GMO-containing foods will be subject to mandatory labelling and more likely that we will see more GMO foods for human consumption. And if we get really comfortable with GMOs, who knows? Anyone for glow-in-the-dark fish and chips? Throwing out the ‘food pyramid’ Many of us grew up being taught some version of the “food pyramid” – a simple visual guide that promoted breads and cereals as the foundation of a healthy diet, with fats at the pointy end. It wasn’t perfect, but was persuasive for generations of people striving for a healthier diet. Now the 20th century food pyramid is a relic of the past. The US dumped its pyramid for the MyPlate guide in 2011. Australia’s Healthy Eating Pyramid has undergone a drastic revision, with fruit and vegetables replacing carbohydrates as the basis of a balanced meal. In June, Public Health England’s scientific advisory committee on nutrition released the results of its seven-year study into carbohydrates and health. Those results put sugar squarely in the crosshairs, and it is becoming increasingly apparent that rather than fat, the more problematic elements of our diet involve refined sugars and other processed carbohydrates. It has already prompted calls for amendments to the UK’s Eatwell Plate. The rise of anti-sugar thinking has all but obliterated the influence of low-fat-high-sugar “health” foods of the late 20th century, but our dependence on processed carbohydrates has been much harder to shake. How we end up doing so may well be the most significant impact on the way humans eat that we have seen in a thousand years. Substituted dishes such as cauliflower “rice”, zucchini “spaghetti” and bunless hamburgers mimic the form, if not the function, of a traditional carbohydrate-based diet. But these stop-gap dishes are unlikely to persist for too long, and as we become more comfortable with reducing the influence of refined carbohydrates in our diet, traditional foods that go back centuries may find themselves out of date. So much of the way we think about food is with carbohydrates at the base. Pasta, rice, bread and potatoes were the foundation for our idea of health, but also for our culinary culture. What will modern Italian food look like if pasta is marginalised? What about a packed lunch if sandwiches are considered less than ideal? Reducing refined carbohydrates isn’t just for health nuts any more, and that means big changes are coming to the very core of our cuisine.",https://media.guim.co.uk/2a56ec5a7c589988b0342aef0b6e8cd2d31d87c2/0_135_3993_2396/500.jpg,0.13106060606060607

No wonder urban professionals are finding satisfaction in making crafts</p>,837,"Finding your business groove is sometimes serendipitous. Just ask Shweta Tripathi, owner of the Brooklyn-based floral design business BeeSpoke. Tripathi, a marketing manager who had started experiencing burnout, decided she needed a change. “I couldn’t recall not feeling exhausted,” she says. So she quit her job, traveled the world for six months and took indulgent classes once she was back home in New York, in an effort to center herself. She tried juggling. French cooking. And a floral arranging class at Ovando, a high-end New York florist, where she ultimately found her new purpose. At the class, Tripathi followed instructions to style carnations, orchids and roses in a vase. She felt electrified. “My hands were shaking,” she says. “I couldn’t put those flowers in the vase fast enough.” Her instructor and classmates praised her, as did her followers on Instagram, where she started sharing her arrangements. Her resulting company, “BeeSpoke,” is named for the noble, focused pollinators of 30% of our crops and 90% of our plants – and the notion that flowers speak to us. “When giving flowers, you are saying, ‘I love you,’ ‘I miss you’ or ‘welcome to my home,’” Tripathi says. “So I transport that endearing message.” Referrals and email newsletters generate one to seven orders, at $200 to $300 a pop, weekly from friends and family for weddings, anniversaries and dinner parties. And an art director friend commissioned Tripathi to create boutonnieres for two Men’s Warehouse photo shoots with two issues of The Knot magazine. “My name is out there now,” she says. Pursuit of the perfect candle Serendipity partnered with a quest for perfection inspired Seattle-based Thalita Baccarin to launch Apotheke 206, a line of eco-friendly soy-based candles. Baccarin had always loved handcrafted candles, but found many lacking in terms of burn and scent. So she made her own – after two years of consulting websites and books and perfecting her fragrances from home. The candlemaking market appears crowded: the National Candle Association estimates approximately $2bn US retail sales annually, excluding accessories. But Baccarin says she believes her niche products, priced at $12 to $25, connect with Washington customers who value nature and locally made goods. She uses American-made materials, including non-GMO, US-grown soy as well as reusable jars made by American Union workers. Regionalizing her scents and names also helps, with offerings like “Washington Forest,” a woodsy, sweet blend with pine, balsam and orange notes. After launching late in 2014, Baccarin, who also works as a University of Washington program coordinator, produces weekly orders of 60 to 250 candles during gift-giving season for six Seattle stores. She sells at a farmers’ market monthly and takes online orders, all with minimal marketing efforts beyond her visits to shops. “I’m amazed I’ve gained so much traction and so quickly with my venture,” she says. Challenges exist, of course. Making candles is messy and requires space, ventilation and supplies, like a protective plastic tarp for her floor. Also, meeting orders alongside working her university job means constant daily work. Even so, Baccarin believes any struggle she feels worth it. “At the end of the day,” she says, “you feel so fulfilled you’ve achieved your mission.” Combining art and architecture Other visually driven hustlers, like Manhattan-based Anna Pietrzak, balance a creative day job and an artistic side venture. She designs international projects with a large architecture firm, and has also promoted her own art and photography through her website, online stores and an exhibit in a reputable Chelsea gallery. Her series Moments of Movement, on life in New York, met great success. And in 2012, when she submitted the entire series to a competition in Poland, she won the gold medal for two pieces. Pietrzak has been savvy with social media to boost publicity. By uploading images of her work to the online art community Society6, she submitted pieces to its zine, then did an interview with the app maker Morpholio. Advice for artistically driven entrepreneurs Understand that toughness is necessary for seemingly delicate crafts. The New York Flower Market, where Tripathi buys her blooms, requires rising early and aggressively haggling for high-quality flowers. Also, customers’ expectations often mean turning around a $250 order within 12 hours. “Arranging flowers is Zen-like work, but functioning in this space is not,” Tripathi says. Don’t dwell on the competition. A market research report tracks 36,000 florists in the US, but through unconventional designs, colors and styling, Tripathi created a niche. Baccarin advises: “Really focus on what makes your brand different.” Find a supportive employer and promote yourself. In her current marketing role, Tripathi easily combines biweekly trips to the flower market and arranging from home. Her boss even orders arrangements for her dinner parties. Know that ignoring an idea for a venture ultimately could take more energy than launching one. “Starting a project feels intimidating to a visual artist,” Pietrzak says, “but once you gain momentum, it’s easier.” Content on this page is brought to you by Squarespace.

70,article,sustainable-business/2015/oct/23/chipotles-corporate-social-responsibility-mcdonalds-gmo,Guardian Sustainable Business,2015-10-23,Chipotle's silence on sustainability practices make it a target for CSR advocates,https://gu.com/p/4dcez,,Chipotle's silence on sustainability practices make it a target for CSR advocates,<p>Chipotle is copping flack on all sides for refusing to demonstrate that its claims regarding GMOs and other sustainable practices are supported by fact and action</p>,866,"Sometimes life does imitate art. Last year, Chipotle Mexican Grill, the fast-growing burrito and taco chain, produced an internet comedy series called Farmed and Dangerous to satirize industrial agriculture. The villain, a sneering character named Buck Marshall, who runs a fictional outfit called the Industrial Food Image Bureau, was inspired by real-life PR operative Rick Berman. Last month, Berman struck back. In a number of brutal ads and on a website dubbed Chubby Chipotle (“Food with hypocrisy”), Berman charged that Chipotle engages in deceptive marketing and sells unhealthy food. Berman runs the Washington-based Center for Consumer Freedom, an industry-backed group that opposes what it calls “a growing cabal of activists” including the “self-anointed ‘food police’, health campaigners, trial lawyers, personal-finance do-gooders, animal-rights misanthropes and meddling bureaucrats”. Chipotle is getting heat from critics on the left as well. Trial lawyers recently filed a class-action lawsuit alleging that Chipotle’s claim that it does not serve genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, is “deceptive and misleading”. Meantime, socially responsible investors (or, in Berman’s argot, “personal-finance do-gooders”) have called upon Chipotle to publish a sustainability report so shareholders can see if its marketing claims are backed up with facts. As if that’s not enough, Chipotle’s ban on GMOs sparked a media backlash from publications ranging from the Washington Post to Mother Jones. In an editorial, the Chicago Tribune said: “Chipotle has embraced the fear-mongering of some food, environmental and health activists who have turned ‘GMO’ into a dirty word.” What’s going on here? To begin with, an upstart has morphed into a big target. Chipotle, which began life as a Denver taqueria started by a classically-trained chef in 1993, has grown rapidly into a fast-casual chain with more than 1,850 restaurants, revenues of $4.1bn last year and a market value of $23bn. (Its rapid growth was partly driven by an investment from McDonald’s, which once owned 90% of Chipotle, but that’s another story.) Some critics are reacting to Chipotle’s aggressive marketing around its claim to serve “food with integrity”. “With every burrito we roll or bowl we fill, we’re working to cultivate a better world,” the company says. Finally, Chipotle has become vulnerable because the company hasn’t demonstrated that its claims are supported by actions. The company isn’t as transparent as competitors including, among others, McDonald’s, which, for all its shortcomings, has published corporate responsibility reports since 2002. Darden Restaurants, Dunkin Brands and Starbucks also report on their impacts. Adam Kanzer, managing director at conscientious investment company Domini Social Investments, which filed a shareholder resolution with Chipotle asking it to report on its sustainability practices, says he finds much to admire about the company: “I’m always happy to see a company that’s publicly challenging the status quo.” But he says Chipotle ought to back up its messaging with data: “What percentage of their supply is organic? What are they doing about farmworkers in their supply chain? Does the drought in California pose any risks? What’s their position on the minimum wage?” In its most recent proxy statement, Chipotle says it made a deliberate decision not to publish a corporate responsibility report, instead devoting its resources to practices that improve sustainability. The company said: “We believe Chipotle is driving more positive change in the nation’s food supply than any other restaurant company.” Chris Arnold, public relations director at Chipotle, says the shareholder proposals from Domini and Trillium Asset Management “lost by a good margin”, which indicates that most shareholders are satisfied with the information they get from the company. The resolutions attracted about 31% of the vote. About the Rick Berman “Chubby Chipotle” campaign, Arnold was unconcerned. Berman, he said, speaks for “a cadre of anonymous big food donors” who take a “remarkably cowardly approach” by hiding behind a nonprofit called the Center for Consumer Freedom. Berman’s office didn’t respond to messages seeking comment. “Exactly what choice or freedom are we infringing upon?” Arnold asks. “I’d argue we providing a choice that, prior to Chipotle, didn’t exist.” Chipotle, he says, provides higher quality ingredients, such as meat and poultry raised without antibiotics, that were hitherto only available in more expensive eateries. A new report from Friends of the Earth and other environmental groups gave only two restaurant chains – Chipotle and Panera Bread – top grades regarding antibiotic use. As for the charge that Chipotle’s sells high-calorie burritos and tacos, Arnold didn’t disagree. But, as he noted, the company website includes a nutrition calculator with all the information that any consumer could want. What’s more, focusing on calories obscures the fact that most Chipotle meals include beans, vegetables, fiber and protein from minimally processed foods, as this analysis notes. Chipotle is also transparent about its “G-M-Over It” policy, noting on its website that the chain’s soft drinks contain high fructose corn syrup, which almost always comes from GMO corn. It also acknowledges that its meat and dairy products are likely to come from animals given GMO feed. Odds are, Chipotle will remain a target for corporate social responsibility campaigners. Kanzer says social investors expect to refile a resolution asking for a CSR report. And so long as Chipotle continues to brand itself as superior to its rivals, those rivals are likely to push back.",https://media.guim.co.uk/74aa6c332f67d5ae6f72c48a3e855d2686e57c15/0_32_3000_1798/500.jpg,0.09228671328671331

Come at me, debunkers’ </p>",524,"We live in unsettling times. Old certainties crumble daily: Jeremy Corbyn leads the Labour party; colouring books for adults are bestsellers; man-buns exist. And now, most disorienting of all, it’s apparently not even true that you’re supposed to drink eight glasses of water a day. This bombshell comes from Aaron Carroll, a US paediatrician who’s researched hydration and who rounded up the evidence in the New York Times: the notion that most of us walk around dehydrated, he showed, is a myth. The web, which loves a good debunking only slightly less than a good shaming, went wild. So I know I’m courting fury by revealing that I still follow the eight-glass rule, and that I think you should, too. Come at me, debunkers! Although on second thoughts, could you hold on a minute while I run to the bathroom? Here’s the argument for my radical stance: there is no suggestion eight glasses is bad; you’ll probably drink fewer sugary drinks; and those toilet trips will stop you sitting, unhealthily, at your desk all day. Plus following any such rule makes you more attentive to what you’re putting into your system. In other words: the eight-glass rule is wrong, on its own terms, but still useful. And I’m convinced all sorts of “rules for living” work this way. Diets are an obvious example: on the rare occasions they work, it’s probably because you’re thinking carefully about food, rather than any specifics. (All manner of eating regimes based on dodgy science – wheat-free, GMO-free, paleo – could thus prove healthy if they result in you consuming less crap.) Or take relationships: “once a cheater, always a cheater” plainly isn’t universally true – but in the early stages of dating, it could be an excellent strategy for filtering out jerks. Barack Obama’s trick for avoiding “decision fatigue” – he always picks from a blue or grey suit – doesn’t derive its value from those specific colours, or garments; the point is that, with the rule in place, he needn’t think further about clothes. Drink eight glasses of water a day, and nothing else, and you’ll never have to wonder if you’re dehydrated, or drinking too much Coke: for as long as you follow the rule, those worries are off your agenda. And scientific research is only so much help in deciding which rules to follow. Christmas came early for debunkophiles in August, when a major effort to rerun 100 psychology studies found more than 60% couldn’t be replicated. For researchers, this is worrying – but for those of us who enjoy plundering psychology research for ideas on better living, it probably isn’t. Even the very strongest studies are true only for the general population, or some subset of it, whereas you’re uniquely you – so a conclusive finding that running alleviates depression, for example, isn’t much personal use if running always makes you feel worse. Conversely, a debunked finding about, say, the benefits of rising early could still prove transformational – for you. And you’d surely be rather strange if you abandoned that fruitful habit solely to “stay scientific”. Anyway, you can’t stay in bed: you’ve got a busy day of water-drinking ahead. oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com",https://media.guim.co.uk/24adf936646a6b9e73f079e86ef2c1ea261ba570/246_0_1158_695/500.jpg,0.1109045815295815
72,article,uk-news/2015/sep/09/food-giant-withdrew-misleading-ad-for-sugar-substitute,UK news,2015-09-09,Food giant withdraws misleading ad for sugar substitute,https://gu.com/p/4c7jv,News,Food giant withdraws misleading ad for sugar substitute,<p>Truvia has been marketed as a natural product by British Sugar but it is chemically processed and contains a synthetic bulking agent</p>,656,"Food giant British Sugar has withdrawn an advertisement extolling the natural virtues of its sugar substitute after a member of the public complained that it was misleading. The controversy is the latest to surround Truvia, which was developed by Coca-Cola and Cargill and contains extract from the stevia leaf – although this accounts for less than 1% of the finished product. Cargill, which brought Truvia to the UK through a partnership with British Sugar’s retail brand Silver Spoon, has already paid out over $6m (£3.9m) in the US to settle lawsuits alleging it misled shoppers by describing the product as “natural”, although it did not admit liability. However, in May an advertisement was published in the UK describing Truvia as “natural deliciousness” and “from nature for sweetness”. After seeing it in the newspaper, Guardian reader Chris Hughes, from Leicester, lodged a complaint with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) and Silver Spoon agreed not to republish the offending claims. An ASA spokesman said: “We received a complaint about a press ad by British Sugar plc that promoted Truvia. The complainant challenged whether the claim that the product was ‘natural’ was misleading and could be substantiated. “We approached the advertiser with the concerns that had been raised. They gave us an assurance that they would withdraw the ad and not use the claim in their future campaigns for the product. On that basis we closed the case informally.” The fact that the matter was resolved informally meant that the simple fact that a complaint was made against British Sugar/Silver Spoon was registered on the ASA website but no details of it. It is the second time the product has been the subject of an informally resolved ASA case. In April last year, British Sugar/Silver Spoon agreed to withdraw a TV advertisement after a single complaint claiming it misleadingly implied that the Stevia plant was the major constituent of the product and that Truvia was a natural product. The claims relating to the naturalness or otherwise of Truvia are particularly sensitive as the product’s emergence was partly to do with the high chemical content of existing artificial sweeteners such as saccharin and sucralose, and in particular consumer concerns surrounding aspartame. Following the US settlement, Cargill retained the right to describe Truvia as “natural”, albeit with an asterisk inviting customers to seek out more information about how it is made on the product’s website. The plaintiffs had argued that although the product contained stevia leaf, it was chemically processed and the bulking agent erythritol is synthetically made. Erythritol has also attracted controversy. It was approved for use as a food additive by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2001 but last year a study published in Plos One (Public Library of Science) found that it killed fruit flies. Questions have also been raised about the manufacturers’ claims that Truvia is not genetically modified. The Truvia website says the dextrose used to make erythritol “is derived from the starch component of US-grown corn. Both GM corn and non-GM corn are grown in the US today. Cargill does not segregate the corn used to manufacture the dextrose used in the erythritol process”. It says it is labelled non-GMO because “erythritol itself is not derived from a genetically modified source, and does not contain any genetically modified proteins”. Hughes, 67, a retired lorry driver and office worker, said: “Cargill had to change their US marketing, now they’re trying it on in Europe. They’ve promised the ASA to drop the ad and change their wording, but the ASA hasn’t published this information because it’s an ‘informal resolution’. “Consumers should have better protection. They shouldn’t have to rely solely on the vigilance of the press.” A Silver Spoon spokesman said: “At the time of the complaint the print advertising campaign had come to an end, so we simply decided to not to run this particular advert again. The ASA are happy with our response.”",https://media.guim.co.uk/2c5441037f4db850a2f62dbdf7ac80a545931a9d/0_0_729_437/500.jpg,0.018595238095238095

The baby was born minutes before with a severe heart malformation that would require complex surgery. What worried her as she waited for the ambulance plane to take the infant from Waimea, on the island of Kauai, to the main children’s hospital in Honolulu, on another Hawaiian island, was that it was the fourth one shehad seen in three years. In all of Waimea, there have been at least nine in five years, she says, shaking her head. That’s more than 10 times the national rate, according to analysis by local doctors. Nelson, a Californian, and other local doctors find themselves in the eye of a storm swirling for the past three years around the Hawaiian archipelago over whether a major cash crop on four of the six main islands, corn that’s been genetically modified to resist pesticides, is a source of prosperity, as the companies claim – or of birth defects and illnesses, as the doctors and many others suspect. After four separate attempts to rein in the companies over the past two years all failed, an estimated 10,000 people marched on 9 August through Honolulu’s Waikiki tourist district. Some held signs like, “We Deserve the Right to Know: Stop Poisoning Paradise” and “Save Hawaii – Stop GMOs” (Genetically Modified Organisms), while others protested different issues. “The turnout and the number of groups marching showed how many people are very frustrated with the situation,” says native Hawaiian activist Walter Ritte of the island of Molokai. Seventeen times more restricted-use insecticides Waimea, a small town of low, pastel wood houses built in south-west Kauai for plantation workers in the 19th century, now sustains its economy mostly from a trickle of tourists on their way to a spectacular canyon. Perhaps 200 people work full-time for the four giant chemical companies that grow the corn – all of it exported – on some 12,000 acres leased mostly from the state. In Kauai, chemical companies Dow, BASF, Syngenta and DuPont spray 17 times more restricted-use insecticides per acre than on ordinary cornfields in the US mainland, according to the most detailed study of the sector, by the Center for Food Safety. Just in Kauai, 18 tons – including atrazine, paraquat (both banned in Europe) and chlorpyrifos – were applied in 2012. The World Health Organization this year announced that glyphosate, sold as Roundup, the most common of the non-restricted herbicides, is “probably carcinogenic in humans”. The cornfields lie above Waimea as the land, developed in the 1870s for the Kekaha Sugar Company plantation, slopes gently up toward arid, craggy hilltops. Most fields are reddish-brown and perfectly furrowed. Some parts are bright green: that’s when the corn is actually grown. Both parts are sprayed frequently, sometimes every couple of days. Most of the fields lie fallow at any given time as they await the next crop, but they are still sprayed with pesticides to keep anything from growing. “To grow either seed crops or test crops, you need soil that’s essentially sterile,” says professor Hector Valenzuela of the University of Hawaii department of tropical plant and soil science. When the spraying is underway and the wind blows downhill from the fields to the town – a time no spraying should occur – residents complain of stinging eyes, headaches and vomiting. “Your eyes and lungs hurt, you feel dizzy and nauseous. It’s awful,” says middle school special education teacher Howard Hurst, who was present at two evacuations. “Here, 10% of the students get special-ed services, but the state average is 6.3%,” he says. “It’s hard to think the pesticides don’t play a role.” At these times, many crowd the waiting rooms of the town’s main hospital, which was run until recently by Dow AgroSciences’ former chief lobbyist in Honolulu. It lies beside the middle school, both 1,700ft from Syngenta fields. The hospital, built by the old sugar plantation, has never studied the effects of the pesticides on its patients. The chemical companies that grow the corn in land previously used for sugar refuse to disclose with any precision which chemicals they use, where and in what amounts, but they insist the pesticides are safe, and most state and local politicians concur. “The Hawai‘i legislature has never given the slightest indication that it intended to regulate genetically engineered crops,” wrote lawyer Paul Achitoff of Earthjustice in a recent court case. As for the birth defects spike, “We have not seen any credible source of statistical health information to support the claims,” said Bennette Misalucha, executive director of Hawaii Crop Improvement Association, the chemical companies trade association, in a written statement distributed by a publicist. She declined to be interviewed. Nelson, the pediatrician, points out that American Academy of Pediatrics’ report, Pesticide Exposure in Children, found “an association between pesticides and adverse birth outcomes, including physical birth defects”. Noting that local schools have been evacuated twice and children sent to hospital because of pesticide drift, Nelson says doctors need prior disclosure of sprayings: “It’s hard to treat a child when you don’t know which chemical he’s been exposed to.” Her concerns and those of most of her colleagues have grown as the chemical companies doubled to 25,000 acres in a decade the area in Hawaii they devote to growing new varieties of herbicide-resistant corn. Today, about 90% of industrial GMO corn grown in the US was originally developed in Hawaii, with the island of Kauai hosting the biggest area. The balmy weather yields three crops a year instead of one, allowing the companies to bring a new strain to market in a third of the time. Once it’s ready, the same fields are used to raise seed corn, which is sent to contract farms on the mainland. It is their output, called by critics a pesticide delivery system, that is sold to the US farmers, along with the pesticides manufactured by the breeder that each strain has been modified to tolerate. Corn’s uses are as industrial as its cultivation: less than 1% is eaten. About 40% is turned into ethanol for cars, 36% becomes cattle feed, 10% is used by the food industry and the rest is exported. ‘We just want to gather information’ At a Starbucks just outside Honolulu, Sidney Johnson, a pediatric surgeon at the Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children who oversees all children born in Hawaii with major birth defects and operates on many, says he’s been thinking about pesticides a lot lately. The reason: he’s noticed that the number of babies born here with their abdominal organs outside, a rare condition known as gastroschisis, has grown from three a year in the 1980s to about a dozen now. “We have cleanest water and air in the world,” he says. So he’s working with a medical student on a study of his hospital’s records to determine whether the parents of the gastroschisis infants were living near fields that were being sprayed around the time of conception and early pregnancy. He plans to extend the study to parents of babies suffering from heart defects. “You kind of wonder why this wasn’t done before,” he says. “Data from other states show there might be a link, and Hawaii might be the best place to prove it.” Unbeknownst to Johnson, another two physicians have been heading in the same direction, but with some constraints. They’re members of a state-county commission appointed this year to “determine if there are human harms coming from these pesticides”, as its chairman, a professional facilitator named Peter Adler, tells a meeting of angry local residents in Waimea earlier this month. Several express skepticism that the panel is anything but another exercise in obfuscation. The panel of nine part-time volunteers also includes two scientists from the chemical companies and several of their critics. “We just want to gather information and make some recommendations,” Adler tells the crowd of about 60 people. “We won’t be doing any original research.” But one of the two doctors, a retired pediatrician named Lee Evslin, plans to do just that. “I want see if any health trends stand out among people that might have been exposed to pesticides,” he says in an interview. “It won’t be a full epidemiological study, but it will probably be more complete than anything that’s been done before.” The panel itself, called the Joint Fact-Finding Study Group on Genetically Modified Crops and Pesticides on Kauaʻi, is the only achievement of three years of failed attempts to force the companies to disclose in advance what they spray and to create buffer zones – which they do in 11 other states, where food crops receive much less pesticides per acre. The pushback from the expansion of the GMO acreage first emerged when Gary Hooser of Kauai, a former state senate majority leader who failed in a bid for lieutenant governor in 2010, ran for his old seat on the Kauai County council in 2012. “Everywhere I went, people were concerned about GMOs and pesticides. They were saying, ‘Gary, we gotta do something’,” he recounts over coffee at the trendy Ha Coffee Bar in Lihue, the island’s capital. “Some were worried about the GMO process itself and others by the threats of the pesticides, and it became one of the dominant political issues.” Once elected, Hooser, who has a ruddy complexion, piercing blue eyes and arrived in Hawaii as a teenager from California, approached the companies for information about exactly what they were spraying and in what amounts. He was rebuffed. In the process of what he called “doing my homework”, he discovered that the companies, unlike regular farmers, were operating under a decades-old Environmental Protection Agency permit to discharge toxic chemicals in water that had been grandfathered from the days of the sugar plantation, when the amounts and toxicities of pesticides were much lower. The state has asked for a federal exemption for the companies so they can avoid modern standards of compliance. He also found that the companies, unlike regular farmers, don’t pay the 4% state excise tax. Some weren’t even asked to pay property taxes, worth $125,000 a year. After pressure from Hooser and the county tax office, the companies paid two years’ worth of back taxes. So with the backing of three other members of the seven-member Kauai council, he drafted a law requiring the companies to disclose yearly what they had grown and where, and to announce in advance which pesticides they proposed to spray, where and when. The law initially also imposed a moratorium on the chemical companies expanding their acreage while their environmental impact was assessed. After a series of hearings packed by company employees and their families wearing blue and opponents wearing red, the bill was watered down by eliminating the moratorium and reducing the scope of the environmental study. The ordinance then passed, but the companies sued in federal court, where a judge ruled that the state’s law on pesticides precluded the counties from regulating them. After the ruling, the state and the county created the joint fact-finding panel officially committed to conducting no new research. Hooser is confident the ruling will be overturned on appeal: the Hawaii constitution “specifically requires” the state and the counties to protect the communities and their environment. In his appeal, Achitoff of Earthjustice argued that Hawaii’s general pesticide law does not “demonstrate that the legislature intended to force the county to sit and watch while its schoolchildren are being sent to the hospital so long as state agencies do not remedy the problem.” In the Big Island, which is called Hawaii and hosts no GMO corn, a similar process unfolded later in 2013: the county council passed a law that effectively banned the chemical companies from moving in, and it was struck down in federal court for the same reasons. A ban on genetically modified taro, a food root deemed sacred in Hawaiian mythology, was allowed to stand. In Maui County, which includes the islands of Maui and Molokai, both with large GMO corn fields, a group of residents calling themselves the Shaka Movement sidestepped the company-friendly council and launched a ballot initiative that called for a moratorium on all GMO farming until a full environmental impact statement is completed there. The companies, primarily Monsanto, spent $7.2m on the campaign ($327.95 per “no” vote, reported to be the most expensive political campaign in Hawaii history) and still lost. Again, they sued in federal court, and, a judge found that the Maui County initiative was preempted by federal law. Those rulings are also being appealed. In the state legislature in Honolulu, Senator Josh Green, a Democrat who then chaired the health committee, earlier this year attempted a fourth effort at curbing the pesticide spraying. In the legislature, he said, it’s an open secret that most heads of the agriculture committee have had “a closer relationship with the agro-chemical companies than with the environmental groups”. Green, an emergency room doctor who was raised in Pennsylvania, drafted legislation to mandate some prior disclosure and some buffer zones. “I thought that was a reasonable compromise,” he says. Still, he also drafted a weaker bill as a failsafe. “If even that one doesn’t pass, it’s going to be obvious that the state doesn’t have the political will to stand up to the chemical companies,” he said in a phone interview at the time. “That would be terrible.” The chairman of the senate agricultural committee, Cliff Tsuji, didn’t even bring the weaker bill to a vote, even though Hawaii’s governor had pledged to sign any bill that created buffer zones. Asked by email what he would do now, Green replied with a quip: “Drink scotch.” This article was amended on 12 October 2015. An earlier version stated that a Center for Food Safety report found pesticides were used in Kauai at 17 times the US mainland average for cornfields. It was restricted-use insecticides, not all pesticides. Also, atrazine and paraquat are among the chemicals sprayed in Kauai but don’t constitute a majority. This has been corrected.

We’re tentatively trying pollock to take the pressure off depleted stocks. But you’ve identified a real problem. We’re not so great at pet food, where globally 2.48m tonnes of “forage fish”, around a 10th of the global catch, ends up. That’s fish like herring, sardines and anchovies shovelled into the bellies of the world’s moggies. Talk about fat cats – even the global harp and grey seal population only gets through 1.7m tonnes. The average Stateside pet eats 13.6kg of fish a year – double that consumed by the average American human. But it gets much worse. Recent investigations have revealed that 50 countries are crewing ships through human trafficking. That includes the large industrial Thai fleet. Once you read about it, it’s hard to forget the details of the horrific abuses suffered by Rohingya, Cambodian and Myanmar migrants sold into slavery. One investigation found men kept in cages to prevent escape. These poor people are forced to spend years at sea working in purse- seine fisheries. The investigations link these horrific fleets to products we buy – especially pet food. Slavery taints thousands of products, given that forage fish are rendered for fish oil and fishmeal. In fact your own consumption of fish oil through supplements may well be negligible compared to your indirect consumption through other means. Despite efforts to develop fish meal and oil substitutes from algae, agricultural by-products and other nonfish sources, nearly 40% of total global aquaculture uses fish oil and fishmeal to feed other fish, including non-carnivorous species like shrimp or tilapia. So forage fish ends up in the food chains of millions of livestock. The exposure of slave-crewed ships will, I hope, push the giant pet food conglomerates to trace their supply chains more carefully. We must keep the pressure on. According to global fisheries expert Giovanni Turchini, a good thing you can do is resist the urge to turn your cat into a greedy gourmet. Upscale wet cat food stuffed full of “luxury” fish should be off the menu. Our feline friends are very happy with less problematic by-products from the fish filleting industry – ironically found in own-brand canned food perceived as downmarket. Trout offal, anybody?

75,article,technology/2015/aug/05/internet-of-things-connected-cows-agriculture-food-production,Technology,2015-08-05,The internet of food: why your steak might have come from a connected cow,https://gu.com/p/4amnc,News,The internet of food: why your steak might have come from a connected cow,<p>Smart sensors are being used to improve agriculture from farming lettuce to producing beef – and even protecting bees</p>,1772,"The cleverest thing in your smart fridge may not be an automated re-ordering button, web-connected camera that tweets when your milk is off, or some other silly convenience system, but the food itself. Agriculture has been quick to trial internet of things (IoT) technologies: already, sensor-controlled rooms are growing altered lettuce, cows are connected to improve milk, and the all-important bee is getting a boost from automated heaters. For food production, the IoT makes sense. Not only does it have the potential to cut costs and boost food production – with a report by Beecham Research predicting that the use of IoT techniques for farming could boost food production by 70% by 2050 – but the use of sensors can also improve animal welfare and reduce the use of resources such as water. Plus, unlike the other areas of our lives where the internet of things is creeping in, there’s no privacy concerns – unless you’re worried about cows being surveilled. Agriculture is one area of the IoT where there’s little downside, and a host of benefits. The internet of things next trick? Improving lettuce ... As it turns out, lettuce isn’t good for everyone. It’s high in potassium, so can be unhealthy for people to eat when on dialysis or suffering chronic kidney disease. To make salads for those with kidney problems, Fujitsu and Microsoft teamed up to grow high-tech lettuce. As odd as it sounds, the project highlights how sensors can be used to help agricultural plants grow faster and better, creating higher yields as well as unique specialisations – if they can do this with lettuce, imagine what they can do with wine grapes. “The hardware sensors are similar to what you see in any semiconductor plant,” said Enrique Andaluz, Director of Strategic Business Development for Worldwide Discrete Manufacturing at Microsoft. Indeed, Fujitsu’s test bed is a chip plant that’s been converted to grow IoT-managed plants. “The information is picked from building sensors that control temperature, humidity, CO2, light intensity and other factors that affect the ‘perfect conditions’ to grow crops.” That data is handed to Microsoft’s Azure cloud, where it’s analysed for reports and to send alerts about its care. All this data means it’s possible to fine tune the conditions to grow low-potassium lettuce. “To reduce the level of potassium at home, you typically cook the raw vegetables to change their internal chemical composition,” said Andaluz. And who wants cooked lettuce? “Fujitsu has been able to produce a raw lettuce with less than 80% of potassium content as compared to traditional grown lettuce.” Thanks to the IoT, crunchy salads for all. Connected cows Up there with smart fridges, connected cows are a staple of IoT stories, and with good reason – the idea of web-connected cows is hilarious. The cows aren’t simply tweeting their position to online followers, however. Under a project run by Dr Jonathan Amory at Writtle College, sensors are tracking dairy cows to help farmers spot illnesses earlier, creating an early-warning system for disease that hopefully cuts suffering for the animals and improves milk yields. The researchers say lameness and diseases such as mastitis cost the dairy industry as much as £100m annually in the UK alone. “Lots of diseases are tricky to spot and time consuming to monitor formally, so having a tool which could flag up cows with possible problems sooner and allow earlier treatment would be really valuable,” said Zoe Barker, the post-doctoral research assistant who runs the project, and is now an expert in sticking sensors to cows. For this research, she said the cows were given a collar that included a positioning sensor, with an accelerometer and magnetometer – though, sadly, no adorable little cow bell. The collars were fitted to a group of more than a hundred cows for six months, with the sensors returning a position on the beasts every 10 seconds, generating data sheets with a million rows of data for each day. Why does it matter where cows are? Simply put, a cow that’s lying down away from the others is more likely to be sick. “We felt that position was important to understand not only the behaviour of the individual cows but also their social behaviour,” Barker said. “Without position, it’s not possible to know how the cows are interacting with each other and how this changes with health status or other management influences.” The researchers had to adapt a system that had been used previously to track carts in mines and to follow firefighters – beasts on a farm is a very different environment indeed. “Once we sorted the optimum tightness of the neck collars, we reduced the number of whole collars lost by the cows in their shed,” she said. “A bigger issue was the cows ripping the plastic box we were using to house an external battery, and ripping the sensor off of the collar and losing that somewhere in the house.” Cows weren’t the only problem. “In addition to our destructive cows, the large amount of metal in a modern cow shed caused a moderate reduction in accuracy due to the potential for deflection of radio waves on the metal,” she added. The huge quantity of collected data now needs to be analysed – mathematicians are creating algorithms, and Barker is in the middle of writing up her paper on the project now – but the hope is it can be used to predict when cows get sick, she said. “If we can create the predictive model then we will be able to detect the changes in individual cow behaviour and social behaviour changes that are associated with the onset of disease, and therefore inform the farmer,” she said. “For diseases such as lameness, where the onset is slow and where clinical symptoms may be masked for a time, we can flag up the issue sooner. Sooner treatment usually means less severe symptoms, less pain, faster recovery and less risk of having a repeat treatment.” These aren’t the only connected cows trodding fields. Alongside its smart lettuce, Fujitsu has given cattle step trackers. “By using pedometers in the cows and bulls farmers are able to predict the best time for mating and to determine whether cattle has healthy living conditions,” said Microsoft’s Andaluz. “For instance, now we know that when cows are in heat, they walk longer distances at a faster pace. By analysing the data on the cow pedometer, it is now easier to find that unique moment for both the cow and the bull to be put next to each other to increase impregnation chances. This translates [to a] 50% increase of meat production as well as to the eliminate risk of disseminating diseases due to prompt diagnosis of diseases in the farm.” Plus, you can find out how many cows pass the 10,000 step count goal. The internet of bees Agriculture is doomed without bees, and so are we. Without bees to pollinate, crops don’t continue and we can’t feed our connected cows. But bees are in trouble. Their numbers have been in sharp decline, and no one is entirely sure why. One explanation for colony collapse disorder (CCD), as the disaster is known, is a type of mite – and researchers at the University of Minnesota and a firm called Eltopia have a solution that pops the plague like popcorn while keeping bees and hives safe. Eltopia chief executive Will McHugh started his career on his family cherry farm, working with local bee keepers on tech even then to alter how the trees were pollinated. While working on that project, the keepers mentioned a mite that was attacking their bees. Those mites can be killed by heat, which doesn’t bother the bees but does melt the wax that makes up their hives. So MacHugh and his fellow researchers developed a way to heat up specific spots in a hive from the inside, rather than heating the entire structure, using circuitry that’s screen-printed on to a hive base, called the foundation. “We have printed circuitry on PLA (corn-based) plastic film that is coated with beeswax and impressed with a honeycomb pattern upon which the worker bees can draw out the comb,” said co-founder Aaron Seelye. “The ink is a special type that can both act as a temperature sensor one moment, and a heater the next. By taking cues from the environment, we can interrupt the reproductive cycle of the Varroa Mite, which is widely considered the leading cause of CCD.” There are points when the mites can be interrupted by temperature changes. When worker bees see that viable larvae are in a spot in the honeycomb, they top it with a wax cap to protect the offspring. That means the temperature stabilises – and when that happens, Eltopia’s MiteNot tech kicks into gear. “What our electronics do is two things: they monitor temperature and they produce heat,” he said. When the temperature stabilises, sensors spot it, and the electronics automatically start generating heat, killing the mites without harming the bees. “If you heat the mites up to 107 degrees or 108 degrees, all the mites die,” MacHugh said. “The bees actually kind of like it. The mites, because they’re so much smaller, it almost pops them like popcorn.” Alongside killing off the troublesome mites, the system also collects other data. “In conjunction with this application, we’re working on things such as audio sensors, temperature and humidity, and durable scale, to tell honey gain [or] loss in a given timeframe),” added Seelye. MacHugh pointed out that it’s “too early in the game” to say if Eltopia’s MiteNot is solving the CCD problem, as the technology has only been rolled out in the last month or so, and it’s not clear whether mites are entirely to blame for the mass deaths of bees. “Removing [or] reducing the mites as a parasitic influence on the colony can only serve to do good for the overall health of our bee colonies, which are a critical component of our food supply,” added Seelye. But Eltopia’s technology could be a first step in changing how we keep pests off the plants we intend to eat. MacHugh pointed out that much of the discussion around food supply centres on pesticides. “There’s a real battle in agriculture – over organic v inorganic, pesticides v GMO, etc,” he said. “I would just say that we’re really focused on not giving in to those arguments and coming up with a solution that’s sustainable.” He stressed he has nothing against pesticides – they were engineered for reason – but it’s understandable that some people don’t want their food covered in chemicals, either. “And it turns out we may not need them.”",,0.06934560809560808
76,article,sustainable-business/2015/jul/21/supply-chain-transparency-chipotle-panera-aspen-foods-barber-foods,Guardian Sustainable Business,2015-07-21,Latest chicken recalls highlight a big gap in supply chain transparency,https://gu.com/p/4azqe,,Latest chicken recalls highlight a big gap in supply chain transparency,"<p>Where does our food come from? Often, big food brands don’t really know, and that can be a problem</p>",765,"The US Department of Agriculture announced two major recalls last week – by Aspen Foods and Barber Foods – due to possible salmonella contamination. Together, the recalls affected nearly 4m pounds of chicken sold in the US. Sadly, this is just the latest in a series of food crises, and it points to a larger issue in the food retail industry: a lack of supply chain transparency. While many brands and food retailers like Chipotle and Panera have adopted new transparency practices in recent years to improve consumer safety, compliance and supply chain efficiencies, there’s still much work to be done. Consumers want more transparency Multiple studies, including several Consumer Reports surveys and a recent survey by Trace One, have found that consumers are demanding more information about where their products come from and how those products affect their health. Trace One’s survey found that91% of consumers said it is important to them to know where their food comes from, while only 7% said they wholeheartedly trust the quality and safety of the food they consume. This tells us that people don’t trust the brands they buy, but that they want to. In a recent conversation, Andrew Winston, a transparency and retail expert and the author of The Big Pivot, said something that really struck me: consumers expect brands to “do the right thing” more than ever now. But the “right thing” is a vague charge. What Andrew means, I believe, is that a consumer’s definition of the “right thing” depends on what is meaningful to that particular person. Some shoppers might expect retailers to provide information about GMO ingredients, while others might expect information about how workers are treated. The food retail community needs to arm consumers – and, thereby, itself – with a wealth of information so that they can decide if a product meets their own personal needs. To do this, companies must first know their supply chains and their many supply chain partners. Supply chain communication breaks down Most big companies know the suppliers in the first tier of their supply chain, but many don’t know any companies in the second, third, fourth or fifth tiers. This means they probably do not know where their ingredients are sourced from, and in which country that farm or plant is located. Without access to this information, they certainly don’t know if those products are safe and won’t be able to act quickly if a crisis arises. Big brands and retailers are realizing that they need to fill the gaps in their supply chain, because it’s their reputation at stake should something go wrong. As Winston puts it: “Anything that happens in your supply chain, anywhere, is on you.” Having full visibility of the supply chain is about more than just avoiding crises. By communicating with partners across the supply chain, companies can ensure compliance, increase productivity and grow more efficient. What’s more, these companies will be better positioned to tell a great story about the care they put into how their products are made. It’s time to open up Often, companies are afraid to share their stories for fear of opening themselves up to public scrutiny. But openly discussing challenges can lead to better solutions. One example, highlighted in Winston’s book, comes from Johnson &amp; Johnson. In 2009, the company was having trouble gathering waste materials from Brazilian landfills. Working with the communities that lived on landfills, the company helped a cooperative to gather those materials, and in turn, Johnson &amp; Johnson was supplied with recycled materials for Band-Aids. As a result, Johnson &amp; Johnson has a more stable supply of recycled content and a good story to tell its consumers. Yes, there is also risk in being transparent, especially when alerting consumers to contamination, but if a company is making solid progress towards a better product despite its challenges, consumers will recognize and reward that openness. A Nielsen study found that 55% of global consumers are willing to pay more for products and services from companies that are committed to positive social and environmental impact. The bottom line is that retailers and brands can’t afford not to be transparent. In a perfect world, retailers and manufacturers wouldn’t have to get to the point of recalling a product before realizing this. The reality is that food crises are inevitable. But with the right communication and awareness between supply chain partners, the potential for these safety lapses – and the damages – will dramatically decrease. And with greater transparency, retailers and manufacturers can more quickly alert consumers to a recall, decreasing both the number of people impacted and the cost.",,0.1906332093832094
77,article,music/2015/jun/28/the-monsanto-years-neil-young-promise-of-the-real-album-review,Music,2015-06-28,Neil Young: The Monsanto Years review – quasi-punk love songs for the planet,https://gu.com/p/4a3dj,Arts,Neil Young: The Monsanto Years review – quasi-punk love songs for the planet,(Reprise),446,"Most pop concerns itself with romantic love. Three songs into his latest album, prolific Canadian songwriter Neil Young exudes frustration at how his metier has become so safe. “People wanna hear about love,” he croons ruefully, backed by a new band in which two of Willie Nelson’s sons star. Young, though, wants to sing about seeds and bankers “too rich for jail”. He wants to talk about how family-run shops are being driven out of business. Young’s not entirely deaf to people’s need for succour – love songs “make us feel all right”, after all. But The Monsanto Years – the elder statesman’s 36th album – is the latest in a line of releases in which Young lays bare his dismay at how we are hurtling towards some arid hell in a gas-guzzler. Young recently upbraided billionaire Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump for his unauthorised use of Young’s song Rockin’ in the Free World for his campaign launch – a PR gift for the musician that could not have been better timed. This is Young in quasi-punk mode, curt of chord, brief of noodle, filled with purpose, marshalling tunes – and whistling, and harmonicas – in the service of the singer’s public service. Often, The Monsanto Years hits home squarely. If I Don’t Know, the album closer, is a moving meta-song, in which Young examines his efforts to get people to give a shit, while his guitar gently weeps. “If the melodies stay pretty/And the songs are not too long,” he reasons, he might restore some respect to the Earth. Country and folk have long tackled injustice. Here, the rambling Workin’ Man tells of farmer Vernon Bowman, sued for taking seed from GMO soy without paying Monsanto a royalty. Young’s issue isn’t with intellectual property rights – musicians like royalties – but with how agriculture has been taken over by corporate McSeed, further impoverishing farmers (a Young concern since Farm Aid). By contrast, you question the lasting artistic merit of ditties such as A Rock Star Bucks a Coffee Shop, which squares up to Monsanto (and Starbucks) with all the elegance of a combine harvester. Love, though, isn’t absent here. Young’s record company might, indeed, consider remarketing Young’s protest music as an album of love songs. You could argue that this whole enterprise is a love song for Young’s partner, the activist-actor Daryl Hannah. She appears on the cover with Young in a parody of Grant Wood’s iconic painting American Gothic that is as pointed as a pitchfork. Songs such as Wolf Moon, a loping duet between the wheeze of harmonica and Young’s falsetto, however, are love songs for the elements. Young is laid low by their beauty and resilience, vowing to defend them.",,0.1891300220247588
78,article,sustainable-business/2015/jun/26/packaged-food-organic-natural-general-mills-kraft-campbells,Guardian Sustainable Business,2015-06-26,"Big food is going green, but will consumers buy in?",https://gu.com/p/4a4m4,,"Big food is going green, but will consumers buy in?","<p data-dropid=""0"">Kraft has taken synthetic dyes out of its macaroni and cheese and General Mills is cutting out artificial sweeteners. Will giant food manufacturers’ sustainability plays pay off – or do too many shoppers think big is bad?<br></p>",1225,"The news this week that General Mills pledged to remove synthetic ingredients from its cereals, following similar commitments from companies such as Nestle, Hershey, Kraft and Pepsi, appears to be a sign of the times. For the first time since packaged foods took the American homes by storm in the 1950s, large food brands are losing market share to small, specialty and organic companies. In response, big brands are taking big steps. Aside from cutting artificial ingredients, some are entering the organic market: General Mills bought organic pasta, meals and snacks company Annie’s Homegrown last year, while Campbell’s acquired organic baby food company Plum Organics in 2013 and launched an organic soup line in February. Big brands will need to continue this trend if they hope to regain baby boomers and attract new millennial buyers. A 2014 report from financial analyst firm Jefferies, Food: the Curse of the Large Brand, found that large consumer packaged goods brands have lost market share in 42 of the 54 most relevant food categories over five years. The shift has been driven, in large part, by demographic changes. By 2020, millennials above 25 years old are expected to comprise roughly 19% of the US population, up from just over 5% in 2010, and make up one third of the adults, according to the Census Bureau. In Trouble in Aisle 5, a 2012 Jefferies report on consumer tastes shifting away from big brands (pdf), analyst Scott Mushkin (now at market research firm Wolfe Research) wrote that the age of 25 is an important milestone because it’s when “income and household formation start to accelerate, creating the catalyst for increased consumption”. The millennial generation’s coming of age could have a big impact on packaged-foods companies. That’s because millennials have consistently shown a preference for locally grown, healthy foods. At the same time, baby boomers have been growing more discriminating about their diet, increasingly opting for foods geared towards bolstering either brain health or physical activity. According to a recent survey by market research firm Alix Partners, 82% of baby boomers and 72% of millennials believe eating healthily is “extremely important”. Both trends – the rise of millennials and the changing habits of boomers – are tipping the scales away from traditionally produced packaged foods. Do shoppers see big as bad? These changes seem to spell good news for both health-conscious consumers and sustainable food producers. But big food companies face at least two big challenges that could get in the way of continuing change: consumer perception and supply chain issues. For some consumers, it doesn’t matter if General Mills converts half its product line to organic; they simply won’t buy items from a large company. Campbell’s CEO Denise Morrison echoed this in a presentation at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York meeting in New York City earlier this year. “There is mounting distrust of so-called ‘big food’, the large food companies and legacy brands on which millions of consumers have relied on for so long,” she said. Big brands are aware of this consumer distrust, and are trying everything they can to address it. “We have been talking for some time about the seismic shifts impacting the food industry,” Campbell’s spokeswoman Megan Haney said in an interview. “[We] understand that increasing numbers of consumers are seeking authentic, genuine food experiences, and that consumers are skeptical of the ability of large, long-established food companies to deliver them.” According to Laurie Demeritt, CEO of the food market research firm The Hartman Group, however, part of the problem is that many big packaged goods companies still don’t understand the nuances of consumer behavior. “The first thing for [consumer packaged goods] companies to understand is that the level at which a consumer cares about organic or ‘free of “X” ingredient’ really varies from category to category,” Demeritt said. “ Someone who buys all organic produce might care less when it comes to crackers and cookies. Or if they care about organic crackers, it might be only the ones they give their kids, not their husbands.” For years, she said, she has been talking to packaged goods companies about adding organic lines to their offerings. However, they balked at the idea, concerned that consumers would think less of their nonorganic products by comparison. “I think they’ve moved away from that, but it still exists to a certain extent,” Demeritt said. “They have to understand that even if consumers are moving in this direction in general, they might still buy your sugary colorful cereal and see no disconnect there.” But the outlook for big companies is far from hopeless, she said. “Consumers are demanding more information about how ingredients are sourced, how animals are treated and employee practices, but they don’t outright believe all big companies are bad,” she said. “About 10%-12% of consumers feel like that, but the vast majority does not. They want to know your story and what you’re doing, and so long as you’re authentic and communicate, then great. They are not just going to outright not like you because you’re big; that’s a fallacy.” Most consumers have no idea which companies own which product lines, she added. So even if there is initial backlash around a big company such as General Mills buying a small company like Annie’s, it tends to have very little impact on sales. “One thing that’s very clear to us is that people have no clue who owns what,” Demeritt said. “Kellogg’s has owned Kashi for 15 years and people still don’t know. Even if you ask them if they care and they say yes, they probably don’t know. When there is an acquisition they go, ‘Oh no!’ But then they continue to buy the products they like.” Are there enough organic ingredients to go around? Big packaged goods companies that are shifting towards more sustainable products also face another daunting problem: access to ingredients. Currently, the demand for organic ingredients vastly exceeds the supply, said Kellee James, founder and CEO of Mercaris, a market data service and trading platform for organic, non-GMO and other specialty agricultural commodities. “The big companies are struggling with it; the small startup food companies are struggling with it.” Campbell’s set about securing ingredients for its new organic soup line long before launch, Hanes said. “We took a long-term view to ensure supply. Being a mainstream brand, the launch required large quantities of ingredients, so we entered into long-term agreements with organic farmers to guarantee supply. Some farmers are planting organic crops specifically for our use.” Eileen Gordon, CEO of the food crowdfunding platform Barnraiser, suggested another way that packaged goods companies concerned about organic ingredients could improve the supply: get involved in production. “Somebody has to fill the funding gap of converting from conventional to organic, and right now there’s no place farmers can turn for that sort of funding,” she said. “If a big company were to do that, and then come out with new organic products, then I would applaud them and say just because they’re big doesn’t mean they’re bad.” • This article was amended on 29 June and 30 June 2015.

79,article,music/2015/jun/23/raging-in-the-free-world-neil-young-monsanto-years-starbucks-geffen,Music,2015-06-23,Raging in the free world: the many furies of Neil Young,https://gu.com/p/4a3td,Arts,Raging in the free world: the many furies of Neil Young,<p>The rocker’s latest album – The Monsanto Years – rails against the GM food giant and Starbucks. But what else has he been angry about in his long career?</p>,1626,"Digital sound quality Few things make Neil Young as apoplectic as modern digital sound quality. In particular, his fury is directed at the MP3 download and its accomplice in crime, the iPod. Listening to music held on a tiny digital file through headphones or computer speakers accounts – says Shakey – for contemporary music’s “loss of soul”. Thus, Young poured his money into the Pono system, a “high-resolution” music service that he claimed would “rescue the art form that I’ve been practising for the last 50 years”. He previewed the launch with an album described by the Guardian’s reviewer as “arguably the lowest-fidelity album ever made by a major artist … muffled, distorted and buried beneath layers of crackle and hiss”. A Letter Home was created in the least expensive studio-like environment ever – a restored 1947 Voice-O-Graph booth (a fairground attraction which allowed users to take home a vinyl record of their voice). When the PonoPlayer finally arrived this January, the 24-bit, 192 kHz-sound, wallet-draining system was variously described as “making a dramatic difference” to the way we hear music or “junk science” – which presumably made Shakey apoplectic too. Motoring Young isn’t the only environmentally aware human being bemoaning the cost to the earth of motoring’s reliance on fossil fuels and gas-guzzling cars. He has however, once again put his money where his mouth is, and developed the Lincvolt, a 1959 Lincoln Continental converted to run on biofuels or electricity. The goal – cue trumpet fanfare – is to “inspire a generation by creating a clean automobile-propulsion technology … to reduce the demand for petro-fuels enough to eliminate the need for war over energy supplies, thereby enhancing the security of nations throughout the world”.l Shakey helpfully explains: “You can plug it in at night and drive about 50 miles during the day if you drive very carefully, maybe about 35-40 if you drive like a maniac. And that’s kinda what I do.” Alas, after one of the car’s team left the charging system plugged in too long, the first such vehicle overheated and burned to the ground, taking an estimated $850,000 worth of Young’s memorabilia collection with it. Now that’s an expensive ride. David Crosby Given that Young has played with David Crosby for decades in Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, eyebrows were raised last year when he declared that the quartet would never tour together ever again. Crosby then confirmed the situation, revealing: “Neil is very angry with me.” On this occasion, the precise source of Shakey’s ire remains unknown, although Croz perhaps upset him by wading into tricky personal waters during the media frenzy surrounding Young’s 2014 divorce from long-time wife, Pegi, and subsequent dalliance with actor Daryl Hannah. “I happen to know that he’s hanging out with somebody that’s a purely poisonous predator now — and that’s karma,” said the Croz. “He’s gonna get hurt.” Crosby later issued a heartfelt apology – presumably after he was hurting too. Donald Trump Despite earlier being photographed together – all smiles, at a Pono launch – Shakey was decidedly less than impressed when the climate-change-denying Republican kicked off the already beleaguered Trump-for-President campaign to the unlikely sound of Rockin’ in the Free World. Young initially issued a statement saying that use of his song was “not authorized”. Neil, being Neil, wouldn’t let it drop, and in a lengthy tirade on Facebook, the Canadian citizen widened his attack to take in not just Trump, but the entire US political system and corporate America. “Corporations don’t have children. They don’t have feelings or soul. They don’t depend on uncontaminated water, clean air or healthy food to survive,” he blasted. They don’t have the best tunes now either – since Young has subsequently given Rockin’ in the Free World to Trump’s avowed rival, Democrat Bernie Sanders. Rude fans Heckling is rarer at concerts nowadays, but it’s a brave fan who risks provoking the Young death glare. At a concert in Dallas, the star had just begun to tell the audience a story about the instrument he was about to play when an impatient fan had the indignity to suggest he, y’know, just get on and play it. “I don’t think I am gonna play it,” said Young at first, triggering widespread laughter. However, other fans then joined in. “How about you talk and I’ll listen?” offered our rock’n’roller, quipping: “I’m trying to recall the last time I did what somebody told me what to do.” His ire was still simmering, however, during the subsequent Harvest Moon, a soft, tender ballad of which Young declared, “Funny. That song is not supposed to be angry,” while glaring at the crowd. Starbucks Young is not best pleased at the world’s largest coffee chain either, as he made a statement on his website last year declaring “Goodbye Starbucks” and urging fans to follow his lead in boycotting the chain. This time, Shakey’s ire had been stoked by the corporate giant aligning itself with GM food company Monsanto in a lawsuit against the state of Vermont. Although the globalised coffee company later insisted that they had nothing to do with this at all, and “has not taken a position on the issue of GMO labelling”,Young insisted: “You have the right to know what’s in your coffee”. He comparing the tiny rural state’s battle with the corporations as being like David versus Goliath, declaring Monsanto “the biggest villain of them all”. Perhaps the most striking aspect of this particular ruckus was Shakey’s admission that he “used to line up and get my latte every day”. The image of the great raging rocker queueing for a steamed milk concoction is not easily shaken off. The Iraq war Given his deeply held peace-and-love ideals, it would have been a surprise had Shakey not railed against the Iraq war, and he did not disappoint. In 2006, three years into the US-led invasion, Young was so upset by the triumphal tone of some newspaper coverage of wounded soldiers being flown to Germany that he cried. He also, true to form, got out his guitar, penning multiple songs criticising the Bush regime’s policy of warfare and associated human cost, culminating in one of his most withering protest songs ever, Let’s Impeach the President. Young admitted that it had been years since he’d crafted such angry music and in fact he’d deliberately held back – but had been moved to write by the lack of younger artists doing the same. He was probably furious at them as well. The Kent State shootings Perhaps the most famous and effective example of Young’s anger giving birth to a song came in 1970, after he saw photos in Life magazine of the fatal shootings by the Ohio National Guard of four unarmed students at Kent State University, during a protest against US involvement in Cambodia. That same evening, Young entered Record Plant Studio 3 in Hollywood and recorded one of the all-time great protest songs, Ohio, in just a few takes. Musically more sad than angry but lyrically ferocious even by his standards, the hit for Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young began: “Tin soldiers and Nixon coming / We’re finally on our own / This summer I hear the drumming / Four dead in Ohio.” Crosby, who reportedly cried at the recording, later described Young’s deliberate, withering reference of the president of the world’s most powerful nation by name as the “the bravest thing I ever heard”. Presumably Shakey wasn’t so angry at Croz in those days. The Keystone XL oil pipeline There was very little chance that Young would don a party hat over a proposed addition to an oil pipeline running all the way from Alberta in Canada to the southern US state of Texas. And still, this incident seems to have made our man more furious that ever. The rocker declared such pipelines “scabs on our lives” in November 2014, and compared the impact of the pipeline on Alberta’s oil sands to that of the Japanese city of Hiroshima after the US dropped the atomic bomb during the second world war. This brought another protest song, 2014’s Who’s Gonna Stand Up, and the lyric: “Ban fossil fuel and draw the line / Before we build one more pipeline.” Meanwhile, for his role in the episode, Canadian president Stephen Harper is “an embarrassment to many Canadians”, “a very poor imitation of George Bush”. Ouch. Geffen Records This is a well-worn story, but it’s always worth another airing. In the early 80s, Young signed to David Geffen’s new label, which expected – not unreasonably – that it would take delivery of more of the classic American rock records that Young had made in the 1970s, such as Harvest and Tonight’s the Night. Instead, executives were rather alarmed when the first Young record for Geffen came in the electronic form of 1982’s Trans, an experimental synthesiser album which Young later explained was a reflection of his attempts to communicate with his young son, who was born with cerebral palsy. When Shakey then turned in Everybody’s Rockin’ – a rockabilly collection – this was just too much for the incensed label, which sued him for the unprecedented and rather hilarious crime of delivering “unrepresentative” music – ie not sounding like Neil Young. Young counter-sued, claiming that his contract allowed artistic freedom, and won an apology. He recorded two more albums for Geffen, before returning to Reprise and delivering – yep, you guessed it, classic-sounding rock. Never let it be said that the angry great man doesn’t have a fantastically dry sense of humour. Meanwhile, anyone fearing for his blood pressure should take heed of his 2010 song Angry World, in which he assures us: “Some see life as a broken promise / Some see life as an endless fight … It’s an angry world, and everything is gonna be all right.”",,0.08074558239031922

The shot across the boughs by a former commission vice-president follows publication of a Wikileaks trawl of 17 negotiating texts for the Trade in Services Agreement (Tisa), which environmentalists fear could outlaw attempts to set bloc emissions limits for airlines or ships. The European parliament has the power to block trade deals like Tisa and the TransAtlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the EU and US, which MEPs will be giving a separate preliminary opinion on Wednesday. “Our right to regulate must be fully and unequivocally preserved,” Vivian Redding, parliament’s conservative rapporteur on Tisa told the Guardian. “The European parliament will never consent to any international agreements, which bypass it. Trade must be about trade, not about constraining democratic choices.” Redding, who was also a former justice commissioner, said that the texts had to be better crafted to leave no room for interpretation, and warned that the issue was “a clear red line.” “We want better international regulation, not lower domestic regulation. We want an upwards levelling of global standards, not a race-to-the-bottom,” she said. “Our standards are not up for sale. They are no trade barriers.” Like TTIP, the Tisa aims to open up and deregulate markets, but while TTIP only covers EU-US trade, Tisa would take in 51 countries, accounting for 70% of global trade in services, under the rubric of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). An article on domestic regulation in its leaked texts would forbid any standards that constitute “arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade in services.” Earlier this year, China was forced to scrap an export ban on rare earths over a WTO challenge, on similar grounds. Cecile Toubeau, a senior policy officer for the green campaign group Transport and Environment said that the ability to set carbon limits on polluting industries could be next. “Imposing this ‘regulatory obedience’ onto Europe would make domestic initiatives to cut emissions in the aviation and maritime sectors difficult if not outright impossible,” she said. “Our climate policy in these areas would be tied to whatever the ICAO and IMO may (or may not) decide. This is an oppressive measure that Europe should fiercely oppose.” A previous attempt by the EU to bring international airlines into its emissions trading system (ETS) was kicked into the long grass after threats of retaliation from several parties to the Tisa talks. A war of attrition against the scheme led senior EU officials to conclude that there should be no repeat in the maritime emissions sector. Luisa Santos, the director of international relations for the employers’ confederation BusinessEurope, declined to comment on the leak but insisted that there was nothing to fear from the proposed deal. “We know it is the intention of the European commission and its member states to obtain the trade agreement and improve market access, and this can be done without putting the EU’s standards or right to make policy choices at risk,” she said. But a lack of clearly-worded exemptions in the leaked text has fanned MEPs’ concerns. “There is a real risk that our ability to set our own climate laws based on our own values will be made impossible,” the Green MEP Claude Turmes said. “Both TTIP and Tisa are jeapordising European democracy.” Disputes resolution mechanisms – such as TTIP’s controversial ‘ISDS’ – are not yet included in the Tisa texts. If none is added, firms will need to pursue complaints about trade restrictions in fields such as licensing, financial services, telecoms, e-commerce and maritime and aviation transport through their national governments. The threat or reality of such state-to-state legal action at the WTO has previously coincided with the EU’s abandonment of environmental regulations in areas such as tar sands, and the import of GMO products.",,0.023360287511230905

Bangkok-based brand strategist Sirikul Laukaikul argues for a “sufficiency economy”, in which companies help ensure that everyone has enough resources. Read Jennifer Kho’s full account here. Sprint pilots paper from wheat straw Sprint is launching a two-month pilot project to test the use of paper made primarily of wheat straw, an agricultural waste that is typically burned, the company said at Sustainable Brands this week. Using paper made from wheat straw instead of trees could reduce deforestation, as well as cut pollution from burning wheat straw. Read Ucilia Wang’s report from the conference here. Kashi: the struggle to define a company philosophy GSB editor-at-large Marc Gunther had this dispatch about Kashi’s and Kellogg’s: “Inside every box, bag and wrapper,” Kashi’s says on its website, “there’s not just real food, but a real food philosophy at work.” What’s the philosophy? That’s hard to say. Some but not all of Kashi’s products are organic. Some but not all are vegetarian or vegan. The company used to described many of its cereals and snack bars as “all natural” but it was forced to stop after settling a class action lawsuit, at a cost of $5m, last year. Once a cereal company known for its whole grains, Kashi now makes snack bars, cookies, crackers, crisps, chicken and pasta entrees, waffles and a variety of pizzas including Indian Tikka Masala and Greek Tzatziki. As for GMOs, don’t ask. Kashi works with the Non-GMO Project to verify that some of its products are GMO-free even as its parent company, Kellogg’s, has spent nearly $2m opposing state-by-state efforts to require labeling of GMOs, according to Just Label It. Jeff Johnson, who is Kashi’s senior director of innovation and new ventures, as well as its “surfing nutritionist at large” – yes, that’s his title – was asked to explain the company’s position on GMOs during a panel at Sustainable Brands. Instead of answering the question, he stated the obvious – that the integration of Kashi into Kellogg’s, which bought the smaller company back in 2000, has not gone smoothly. “I’ve been through all the ups and downs,” Johnson said. “As we got bigger, we drifted from our purpose and made some mistakes. All of us, Kashi and Kellogg, have learned from those and come out stronger.” Kellogg couldn’t even decide where to put Kashi for a while. In 2013, Kashi was moved from San Diego, where it was founded in 1984, to Battle Creek, Michigan, Kellogg’s longtime home base. Last year, Kashi moved back to San Diego. By way of explanation, Johnson said: “We all have parents.” Two new ways to tackle human trafficking Human trafficking and forced labor – often hidden deep in the supply chain – is thorny issue businesses to tackle. Companies that want to address the problem may not know how to do so or where to start. But it’s a huge problem: an estimated 21 million people are part of the forced labor worldwide, according to the International Labor Organization. Ucilia Wang came across two potential solutions at the Sustainable Brands conference this week. The first is a certification program by the Lacey, Washington-based Tronie Foundation, which aims to end human trafficking. Co-founder Rani Hong promoted the foundation’s Freedom Seal program at the conference. To apply for the seal, companies must meet 11 criteria to demonstrate they are taking steps to eliminate forced labor and indentured servitude in their businesses and supply chains. They must also pay an application fee, based on their annual revenue, of $2,500 to $10,000. The certification, which launched last year, hadn’t received applications until after it modified the criteria in February. She hopes to announce the inaugural class of companies to earn the seal on 30 July, the United Nations’ World Day Against Trafficking in Persons. Meanwhile, outdoor apparel retailer Patagonia chronicled its four-year-long effort to document and prevent slavery and other poor labor practices among its suppliers in a blog post published Wednesday. The initiative began with a look at its Taiwanese suppliers, which were hiring laborers through brokers who charge migrant workers for finding them jobs. The fees aren’t illegal, but they create indentured workers. For one thing, brokers have been found to charge above the limits. A labor contract usually lasts three years, yet it could take a worker two years to earn enough to pay off the fees, according to California-based Patagonia. After the contract ends, the workers go home and start the process again. The retailer now requires its Taiwanese suppliers to either pay for any broker fees or to bypass brokers and hire directly. It also requires them to reimburse any current workers who had to pay more than the legal fees if they were hired before 1 June. Wondering how to track and create policies to eliminate human trafficking in your own supply chain? Patagonia has created a set of standards and a guide, and has posted it online for other companies to check out. This post was amended 4 June. A previous version incorrectly stated the Tronie Foundation is based in Washington DC, and that it hadn’t yet received any applications for the Freedom Seal. In fact, the foundation is based in Lacey, Washington, and Hong now says it has received applications since March. It pays to take care of employees, no matter where they live Jennifer Kho has this dispatch from a talk with CEO of Levi Strauss, Chip Berg, on day two of the conference: For every dollar invested in improving the lives of their workers, factories that supply Levi Strauss get $3-$4 back, said CEO Chip Berg in an onstage conversation with GSB editor-at-large Marc Gunther on Wednesday. At least that’s what happened in a two-year pilot program the company conducted as part of its Wellthread collection of socially and environmentally sustainable clothing, he said. “We decided that improving worker wellbeing was really the next level of engagement in our supply chain,” he said. “It’s not a secret – most factories are in developing countries, and most workers are women and low-income.” In its pilot program, which included a factory in Bangladesh, the company offered education on finance, health and wellness, as well as services such as free medical care, free transportation and more. How does education, for example, yield financial returns? For one thing, most women at the factory don’t go to work during their monthly cycle, Bergh said. Health education has resulted in more women coming to work during their periods, meaning they are making more money, demonstrating that women can work all month and lowering absenteeism, which reduces costs for the factory. “We were working to demonstrate there is a business case here,” Bergh said. “We’ve proven the business benefit to factory owners to make these investments to improve workers’ lives.” Now it’s up to the factory owners, he added. “We funded the pilot project, but now that we’ve proved the case, it should be investable by factories.” Adding another incentive for its suppliers, Levi aims to source 80% of its products from sustainable factories by 2020. It will be a challenge given the company sources from 20-25 different countries today, in both the western and eastern hemispheres. “Change is hard and it takes a little bit of courage to take a step like this,” he said. “We were willing to put money where our mouth is to demonstrate the business case... Our hope over time is this will be the new norm in the industry. By the time we’re sourcing 80% from those factories, we will be touching 150,000 workers in the industry and we will have a big impact on those workers and companies.” Has the sharing economy prevented a political uprising? Jennifer Kho spoke with Jerry Michalski, founder of relationship economy coalition Rex, about his views on the sharing economy. “In an economy where it’s very hard to upskill, light, temporary work that you can operate at your convenience is essential,” he said. “It’s a palliative – otherwise we would have revolts in the streets.” In other words, as the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow, having the ability to get flexible work driving for Lyft or Uber, for example, can be a key stopgap for the unemployed or underemployed. But that option isn’t available to the poorest families, which might not have a car that’s fancy enough for Lyft or Uber, Michalski added. Companies like TaskRabbit and Fiverr offer odd jobs that wouldn’t necessarily require a new car, but the pay is low and in many cases, workers haven’t been able to make a living wage. “It’s not enough money,” Michalski said. The lack of job opportunities for unskilled workers, though, isn’t the only reason the sharing economy is booming. Uber’s revenues, for example, are three times the size of the taxi industry’s in San Francisco. And Airbnb has grown to 1m rooms, with revenue of about $423m last year. Part of the reason for all the growth is that sharing economy companies build relationships and community, whereas conventional businesses tend to come across as more transactional and impersonal, Michalski said. Even the language that companies use, with terms such as “consumers” and “prosumers”, doesn’t make it sound as though they are talking about people, he said. To “rehumanize” the relationship between businesses and customers, companies need to show they see their customers as peers. “Don’t call them ‘consumers’,” he said. “’Consumer’ is truly a deprecating word.” Meanwhile, business models such as Airbnb’s help connect people in a different way, he claims. For example, people are staying in his house in Noe Valley right now, and there are no hotels in his neighborhood, so without Airbnb, his guests wouldn’t have been able to stay in that area. “Even though it’s transactional, we haven’t lost the whole community thing,” he says. “We’re letting people into the house that we normally wouldn’t, and we normally wouldn’t get to see those people’s houses that we visit.” The personal connection is what has kept the sharing economy from becoming just a rental economy, he hypothesized, but that could still change. “If we get to the point where you’re using someone’s drill and then hiring someone to pick up the drill, then you’ve lost that” sense of community and it’s just a transaction with delivery, he said. Welcome to the Sustainable Brands conference slow blog In sunny San Diego, California, nearly 2,500 business leaders, experts, investors and NGO advocates are gathering this week to discuss corporate sustainability at the Sustainable Brands San Diego conference. As they share new ideas and initiatives, case studies, and best practices, we’ll collect the best nuggets to share with you here. Closed Loop Fund to announce its first loans GSB editor-at-large Marc Gunther sent this dispatch about recycling: These are challenging times for recycling in the US, partly because our trash isn’t worth as much as it used to be. Low oil prices make it harder for recycled plastic to compete with virgin plastic, which is derived from petroleum. The slowdown in China’s economy has reduced demand for recycled cardboard and paper. David Steiner, the chief executive of Waste Management, the US’s biggest recycling company, recently told NPR: “I don’t think crisis is too strong of a word [for] the recycling industry throughout the United States.” Help might be on the way. Next month, the Closed Loop Fund, a $100m investment fund to promote recycling in the US, plans to announce its first four loans, all aimed at improving recycling infrastructure. The loans will likely go to city projects that are designed to make recycling easier or more convenient for consumers, or to companies that offer ways to improve trash sorting and processing, according to Bridget Croke, the fund’s head of partner relationships. “Recycled material, by and large, should be economical to use – it should be cheaper – but there’s not enough of it coming back into the system,” Croke said this week at the Sustainable Brands conference in San Diego. The US’s overall recycling rate has been stalled at about 34% since the 1990s. Ten of the US’s biggest companies, led by Walmart, announced the Closed Loop Fund in April 2014. Other backers include Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Keurig, companies that, not incidentally, have been blamed for creating too much waste in the form of bottled water and coffee pods. Critics such as Matt Prindiville, associate director for environmental policy advocacy Upstream, call the fund insufficient and say it is a way to head off government regulation of waste. “Our goal is to get it to at least 50%, at least for cans and bottles, by 2018,” said Tim Carey, senior director of sustainability at PepsiCo. The fund has received 45 to 50 applications since last fall, Croke said. “You’d be surprised how hard it is to give away money to a city,” she said. “There’s a lot of red tape.” The fund itself has a “very rigorous due diligence process” aimed at choosing projects that are replicable and scalable,” she added. To its credit, the fund’s leaders have set specific time-based targets. By 2025, they expect the initial $100m in investments will lead to more than 75m tons of greenhouse gas emissions cuts, the diversion of 27m cumulative tons of waste from landfills, the creation of 27,000 new local jobs and more than $1.9bn in savings from municipal waste disposal.",,0.08696651387827861
82,article,lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2015/may/18/rapeseed-to-coconut-oils-every-kitchen-should-have,Food,2015-05-18,From rapeseed to coconut – the oils every kitchen should have,https://gu.com/p/492hk,Lifestyle,From rapeseed to coconut – the oils every kitchen should have,"<p>Olive oil may have become a staple for most home chefs, but there are others worth considering</p>",736,"The demand for rapeseed oil is at an all-time high and no wonder – cold-pressed, extra-virgin rapeseed oil can rival the best olive oils in flavour and versatility, and as far as health benefits go, it far outstrips the Mediterranean staple. Put the latter’s ubiquity down to pure habit: while recipe writers and cooks might default to the latter, there are plenty of serious alternatives. The important things to consider when choosing an oil are the type and percentage of fat it contains, the flavour it brings, and the temperature to which it can be heated before it starts to break down and become unpleasant: its smoke point. Cold-pressed extra-virgin oils are minimally processed and unrefined, leading to more pronounced flavours and lower smoke points: they are great used as is, for dressing a salad or finishing a dish. Conversely, hot-pressed oils are filtered, bleached and deodorised, making them more neutral in taste and better suited to the hottest applications: deep-frying, searing etc. What you want to avoid most keenly are trans or hydrogenated fats – ie shortening – which are man-made enemies of cardiovascular wellbeing. Lastly, wherever possible, go organic for oils that are pesticide and GMO-free. Olive oil The oil, synonymous with the Mediterranean diet, is made by crushing fresh olives, those that curdle your mouth with their unpalatably dry bitterness. Extra-virgin olive oil is fresh-tasting, fruity and grassy, often with peppery notes – perfect for drizzling on salads and finishing soups and pasta dishes. It smokes at around 165-190C/325-375F, so is definitely best for drizzling over finished dishes. Refined, it is much more bland-tasting, and smokes at 240C/465F, so while it’s still not great for deep-frying, it will do handsomely in any Mediterranean-style meal. Olive oil boasts high levels of monounsaturated fat, ie the good kind, promoting healthy cholesterol. Extra-virgin olive oils are pressed within 24 hours of the olives being harvested, ensuring a low acidity rate, and lots of polyphenols: antioxidants that may help in preventing cardiovascular disease. Rapeseed oil Made from the tiny black seeds of Brassica napus, rapeseed or canola oil is one of only two oils grown and bottled in the UK, which is one excellent, locavore reason for using it. It is the lightest of the edible oils, boasting – at 6% – a lower level of saturated fat than any other. Like olive oil, it is high in monounsaturated fats, but has considerably higher levels of vitamin E. It has a delicate, nutty flavour that keeps it versatile. When extra-virgin and cold-pressed, it is delicious in dressings and dips, as well as in baking, frying and general cooking. Groundnut oil Made from pink peanuts and neutral in flavour, this is the oil of choice for the deep-fryers of the world: its smoke point is 230C/450F. Produced primarily in China and India, it is a good all-rounder, high in polyunsaturated, monounsaturated and saturated fats, with a very stable shelf-life. You won’t want to drizzle it neat on anything special, but it will make an excellent fritter. Sunflower oil Hailing predominantly from Russia, Ukraine and Argentina, sunflower oil is made from the eponymous seeds, although the flavour of processed versions won’t tell you as much. It is a neutral-tasting oil, with a relatively high smoke point – 225C/440F – and, when used in moderation, is well suited to general cooking. It boasts high levels of polyunsaturated fats, in particular linoleic acid, which for some is not that good of a thing – opting for high oleic sunflower oil is deemed preferable. In terms of flavour, eco-chef and sustainability advocate Tom Hunt recommends organic sunflower oil for an altogether more toothsome experience. “You really taste the seeds as you know them – it makes a beautiful mayonnaise,” he says. Coconut oil The wunderkind of the wellness world, coconut is having a moment, with every other healthy-eating advocate singing the fruit’s praises. Coconut oil is extremely high in saturated fats, with an enormous 92%. And yet, apparently, this should not deter you from using it, so long as you get it virgin and unrefined. It has an intense aroma, when heated, that belies how sweet and mellow it tastes. Allegra McEvedy uses it frequently but sparingly in cooking, for “its good richness”, while for finishing a dish, she’ll plumb instead for a Mexican avocado oil – fresh and peppery. Coconut oil is rich in lauric acid, a fatty acid that reportedly contributes to reducing cholesterol and it is said to improve metabolism.",,0.23953756613756616
83,article,science/political-science/2015/may/01/science-harassment-and-the-limits-to-transparency,Science,2015-05-01,"Science, harassment and the limits to transparency",https://gu.com/p/482qn,News,"Science, harassment and the limits to transparency","<p>Activists and corporations are increasingly using public information laws to intimidate scientists. Funding disclosures are fair game, argues Michael Halpern. But documents related to the research process should stay off limits.</p>",939,"In 2009, a law firm representing Philip Morris submitted freedom of information requests to the University of Stirling for the work of three scientists - Gerard Hastings, Anne Marie Mackintosh and Linda Bauld – who were studying the impact of tobacco marketing on adolescents. They sought all primary data, questionnaires, handbooks and documents related to the researchers’ work, much of which was confidential. Although the requests were eventually dropped due to negative publicity, responding to and challenging them cost the scientists and the university’s lawyers many weeks of work. “The stress of all this is considerable,” the scientists involved, wrote afterwards. “We are not lawyers and, like most civilians, find the law abstruse and the overt threat of serious punishment extremely disconcerting.” This was no isolated incident. Activists and corporations of all political stripes in a growing number of countries are increasingly harassing and intimidating university scientists, using public information laws which were originally designed for citizens to understand the workings of government. In an editorial in this week’s Science magazine, climate scientist Michael Mann and I explore this problem and ask a pressing question: how do we balance public accountability with the privacy essential for scientific inquiry? The rise of electronic communication means that the process of science is now recorded more than ever before. Conversations that used to happen in person or over the phone take place via email. This allows scientists to collaborate more easily across time zones and continents. It also means that much of the research process is written down and is therefore easier for outsiders to attempt to scrutinize. Scientists who helped fix the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster outlined the problem when their email correspondence was subpoenaed by BP. “Our concern is not simply invasion of privacy, but the erosion of the scientific deliberative process,” they wrote. “Deliberation is an integral part of the scientific method that has existed for more than 2,000 years; e-mail is the 21st century medium by which these deliberations now often occur.” To be sure, transparency is essential to protecting the independence of public institutions, including universities. In 2013, for example, faculty at Florida State University discovered through Florida’s open records law an agreement that inappropriately gave the Charles Koch Foundation control over the hiring of economics professors and curriculum content. University of Kansas students are seeking information about similar alleged Koch influence on their campus. But scrutiny beyond funding disclosure can be significantly disruptive and discourage scientists from pursuing policy relevant research. In too many places, those who disagree with a professor’s research or line of inquiry are seeking all information in his or her university’s possession (even handwritten notes). Regardless of your line of work, can you imagine if every email you wrote, every rough draft, every honest criticism of a colleague’s work was placed in the public domain? You’d never get anything done. Freedom to Bully, a report I wrote earlier this year for the Union of Concerned Scientists, describes this problem in detail, examining cases of environmental chemists and public health scientists and law professors who were at the receiving end of these requests. Since then, the high-profile requests have kept coming. In February, an anti-GMO group asked four universities for extensive correspondence of fourteen biologists. In March, the West Virginia Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case where a mining company is seeking 216,000 documents related to the work of an occupational health scientist at West Virginia University. Although some universities and researchers are pushing back against these pressures, levels of privacy protection vary by region, state and nation. This can create competitive advantages for universities in places that protect faculty communication, to the detriment of peers. Scientists at protected institutions may become hesitant to work with their colleagues at non-protected institutions. The Virginia Supreme Court found in 2014 that excessive disclosure could cause “harm to university-wide research efforts, damage to faculty recruitment and retention, [and] undermining of faculty expectations of privacy and confidentiality.” So what should be disclosed, and what should be kept secret? As a general rule, scientists should make public their sources of funding, and state whether there are any strings attached to that funding. Spending records are fair game. But documents related to the research process should stay off limits. Yet where do you draw the line? It is increasingly apparent that we need common disclosure standards that put all scientific institutions – public and private – on a level playing field. Some suggest that national academies of science should take up this charge, working with learned societies, university associations and others. UCLA’s Statement of the Principles of Scholarly Research and Public Records Requests provides a great starting point. We need to get creative in getting these common disclosure standards adopted. Implementation could become a requirement for university accreditation, for example. The standards could also be embraced by government grant-making bodies, increasing the likelihood that state laws will be modernized to protect faculty correspondence. In the meantime, scientific institutions should strengthen their resilience to intrusive requests, which means being proactive and prepared. Public universities should articulate their practices for responding to open records requests. They should equip faculty and staff with an understanding of how open records laws can be misused, and advise them on how to use email responsibly. And they should defend their employees from invasive requests. Otherwise, scientists will waste far too much time and money on litigation that should be spent on science and discovery. Public trust in science will inevitably suffer as a result.

84,article,business/2015/apr/27/chipotle-gmo-food-off-the-menu,Business,2015-04-27,Chipotle removes all GMO ingredients from its menu,https://gu.com/p/47q7g,News,Chipotle removes all GMO ingredients from its menu,"<p>Mexican grill becomes first large restaurant chain in US to use only non-GMO ingredients, a week after sales rose 10.4% in the first quarter of 2015</p>",608,"Chipotle will no longer use genetically modified food in its stores, the company announced on Monday. The fast-growing Mexican restaurant chain will be the first US company to use only non-GM ingredients. “There is a lot of debate about genetically modified foods,” Steve Ells, the founder, chairman and co-CEO of Chipotle, said. “Though many countries have already restricted or banned the use of GMO crops, it’s clear that a lot of research is still needed before we can truly understand all of the implications of widespread GMO cultivation and consumption. While that debate continues, we decided to move to non-GMO ingredients.” Eliminating GMO ingredients is no easy feat, and the company has previously struggled to keep up with other pledges it has made, including the use of ethically raised pork. More than 90% of corn and soy grown in the US comes from GMO strains. GMOs are present in 75% to 80% of conventional processed food in the US, according to the Grocery Manufacturers Association. In order to use only non-GMO ingredients in its stores, Chipotle has been working with its suppliers to increase their production of non-GMO corn flour and sunflowers. “We’re working with our farmers to plan enough of these crops we need to meet our supply,” Ells told the New York Times. Chipotle has voluntarily disclosed GMO ingredients in its food since 2013, and had at that time pledged that it would eliminate GMO ingredients from its food. According to Ells, the transition was more straightforward because many stores already used non-GMO food. The company also has a smaller list of ingredients than its competitors. Excluding tortillas, the entire chipotle menu is just 46 ingredients, according to Chipotle. The next step in providing its customers with “the very best ingredients” is re-inventing its tortillas. “Tortillas are the only food item on Chipotle’s menu that contains any additives, which include a minimal number of preservatives and dough conditioners,” the company said in a statement on Monday. It added that it is “now embarking on a quest to eliminate all of the remaining additives”. Last week, same-store sales at Chipotle rose 10.4% for the first quarter, missing projected 11.8% growth, according to figures released on Tuesday. “I’m pleased with our performance for the first quarter,” Ells said at that time. “And we’re off to a strong start in 2015.” Chipotle, which operates about 1,800 restaurants, plans to open between 190 and 205 more stores in 2015. The main reason for the lower-than-expected sales in the first quarter was its pork shortage. “Carnitas customers really love our pork, and aren’t visiting unless they know we have carnitas in their market,” John Hartung, Chipotle’s chief financial officer, said on Tuesday. “They order that favorite meal every single time they visit. Many decided to hold out until carnitas returns to their market.” In 2011, Chipotle launched its first sustainable farming campaign. Earlier this year, an audit revealed that one of the suppliers was not complying with the chain’s progressive animal welfare standards and as a result, the company stopped selling carnitas at one third of its locations. The company said it might increase prices in the coming months. “Chipotle’s move to non-GMO ingredients did not result in significantly higher ingredient costs for the company, and it did not raise prices resulting from its move to non-GMO ingredients,” the company said in a statement. The main reason for the potentially higher prices is the beef, Ells told the New York Times. “With pork, it’s harder, because we only need one part of the animal – the shoulder – and the farmer needs to sell the whole animal to make it work,” he said.",https://media.guim.co.uk/74aa6c332f67d5ae6f72c48a3e855d2686e57c15/0_0_3000_1801/500.jpg,0.17283549783549784

He told his audience he was surprised by the criticisms, and believes that doctors should not fight their battles or each other in public. “But now I believe I must,” he said. The group of doctors last week urged university officials to remove Oz from a faculty position on the grounds that he promotes “quack treatments” and “has repeatedly shown disdain for science and for evidence-based medicine, as well as baseless and relentless opposition to the genetic engineering of food crops”. Oz’s response to his critics – first touted in a Facebook post on Friday – has now become an all-out defense campaign that includes an op-ed in Time magazine, an episode-long defense and a follow-up interview on NBC’s Today show last Friday. The doctors calling for Oz’s dismissal have included his stance on GMO labeling as one of their leading complaints. The stance, while controversial, is not as severe as the other accusations, which have previously landed him in hot water with both the Federal Drug Administration and the US Senate. On Thursday’s show, Oz discussed a report on a genetically modified apple that aired earlier this month. The apples in question are modified so that they do not turn brown, and Oz has been accused of stirring fear of the apple, which has been approved by regulatory health commissions, in his initial segment. Henry Miller, the lead author of the Columbia letter, had previously criticized that segment in a piece for Slate, defending the apple as safe and calling Oz’s statements “New Age nonsense”. Oz didn’t address the critics on his own. Among the guests appearing on the show was Gary Ruskin, cofounder and the executive director of US Right to Know, who denounced Oz’s critics. “What Henry Miller does is he speaks on behalf of big corporations and he tells big lies on their behalf,” said Ruskin. Four of the doctors who signed the letter, including Miller, have at some point been associated with the American Council on Science and Health. “They are rent-a-scientists,” Ruskin said about the council. In the Time magazine op-ed leading up to Thursday’s episode, Oz defended his stance on GMO labeling, noting that some topics can be controversial but worthwhile. “And this brings me back to a motive for the letter,” he wrote. These doctors criticized my ‘baseless and relentless opposition to the genetic engineering of food crops’, which is another false accusation. Whether you support genetically engineered crops or not, the freedom to make an informed choice should belong to consumers. The bill in Congress this month proposing to block states from independently requiring labeling offers a coup to pro-GMO groups.” Gilbert Ross, one of the doctors who signed the letter, is the acting president and executive director of the American Council of Science and Health, which has previously received grants from Monsanto, a manufacturer of GMO seeds. In 1996, Ross had also served a sentence for participating in Medicaid fraud. “Given the mistake I made more than 20 years ago, I now recognize that I should not have added my name to Dr Henry Miller’s letter,” Ross said in a statement sent to the Guardian. “Even though I believed in the letter’s content – to focus attention on the often-questionable medical advice Dr Oz dispenses on TV – I see that by doing so it only opened me up to personal criticism. It also diverted necessary attention away from challenging many of Dr Oz’s unscientific claims. My involvement was solely based on trying to protect America’s public health.” While discussing Ross on Thursday, the show splashed a “convicted felon” across a picture of him. In a preview clip of Thursday’s show, Oz recognized that he has “irritated some potential allies” in his “quest to make American healthy”. “No matter our disagreements, freedom of speech is the most fundamental right we have as Americans. And these 10 doctors are trying to silence that right,” he said. Oz also included a statement from the BMJ, formerly the British Medical Journal, which he described as his harshest critic. A BMJ analysis of 40 random episodes of the Dr Oz Show revealed that his recommendations were supported by evidence only 46% of the time, a fact his critics have cited frequently. On Thursday, Oz shared a statement from the BMJ that said the authors of the study were “disappointed that the overwhelming commentary seems to be that our study somehow proves that Dr Oz or The Doctors are quacks or charlatans or worse. Our data in no way supports these conclusions.”",,0.11684514316093261
86,article,commentisfree/2015/apr/22/wellness-gurus-belle-gibson-pseudoscience,Opinion,2015-04-22,Pseudoscience and strawberries: ‘wellness’ gurus should carry a health warning | Hadley Freeman,https://gu.com/p/47mj7,Opinion,Pseudoscience and strawberries: ‘wellness’ gurus should carry a health warning,"The blogger Belle Gibson has been exposed as a fraud – but the internet is still awash with others like her, pushing unsubstantiated nutritional advice",1055,"Last decade my absolute favourite genre of journalism was: “Here, look at this rich person’s fabulous house.” You know the sort of articles: a journalist trots along to a wealthy person’s ridiculous house in Oxfordshire / the Hamptons / the Caribbean and writes a suitably gushy piece about how this person’s purchase of a £30,000 terracotta pot for their living room proves their moral superiority and, really, why don’t we all cover our bedrooms in customised de Gournay wallpaper ($650 per panel)? But times change and journalism changes with it, and after the recession £30,000 terracotta pots began to look a bit infra dig. So a new genre of journalism has risen up in response to a growing trend, and it is one I also enjoy immensely, albeit in a slightly different way. Now, the articles I relish most are ones debunking quacky pseudoscience bloggers. A classic of its kind will be published this week in the Australian Women’s Weekly magazine which has an interview with self-described “wellness guru”, 23-year-old Belle Gibson, who claimed in a blog to have cured her terminal brain cancer by cutting out gluten and sugar. Her blog spawned an app, which was downloaded more than 300,000 times, followed by an inevitable book, The Whole Pantry, featuring photos of brown food photographed in a perfect rustic kitchen. So far, so zeitgeist. But there was one problem: Gibson had never had cancer. In the magazine interview, Gibson admits “None of it’s true.” As the magazine puts it, unimprovably: “She says she is passionate about avoiding gluten, dairy and coffee, but doesn’t really understand how cancer works.” Gibson is not the first “wellness blogger” to be caught out by her own ignorance, and she certainly won’t be the last. Wellness bloggers are increasingly numerous, astonishingly popular and embarrassingly feted by the media which never can resist attractive young women (who make up the most prominent members of this demographic) talking about food and being photographed nibbling on a strawberry. They write blogs about healthy living, which invariably means randomly cutting out various food groups and gluten (although how many of them actually know what gluten is remains to be ascertained), even though most of them have no nutritional training beyond feeding themselves. They run stylised Instagram accounts showcasing their food and how attractive they look eating it, and they write in a chummy “just sayin’ it like it is, guys” style so suited to the internet. They usually have a story about how they fell ill and cured themselves through their diet. They often claim that the modern food industry is killing us all and they always suggest that if you follow their instructions to the letter you, too, will be as gorgeous as they are, and maybe even able to nibble a strawberry as sexily to boot. Gwyneth Paltrow’s blog Goop, with its promotion of detox diets and juice fasts, is a version of the type. Ella Woodward, the daughter of former Northern Ireland secretary Shaun Woodward, is another example with her blog Deliciously Ella, and she has been profiled adoringly in London’s Evening Standard and photographed with the requisite strawberry. In the US, Vani Hari is better known as the Food Babe and she has garnered a huge following by making claims that non-organic apples can be more fattening than hot fudge sundaes (something to do with the buildup of pesticides in your body) and that bread is made out of yoga mats (it’s not). It may not surprise you to learn that Hari, a former financial consultant, appears to have absolutely no medical or nutritional qualifications. Gillian McKeith, deliciously debunked by Ben Goldacre in this paper in 2007, is a kind of grandmother to today’s wellness bloggers. The former actress and Playboy model Jenny McCarthy also contributed some DNA to them with her absolute certainty in herself despite her lack of medical training. “The university of Google is where I got my degree from,” McCarthy has said, repeatedly. Since 2007, McCarthy has claimed that her son, Evan, developed autism as a result of vaccinations, and she insists that autism can be cured by healthy eating. McCarthy has been repeatedly cited as a major factor in the anti-vaccination movement in the States, which in 2012 led to a spike in whooping cough cases followed by a measles outbreak in Disneyland in California earlier this year. McCarthy has harped repeatedly on the idea that the medical establishment is not to be trusted – only outsiders like her speak the truth, and it’s a mentality that appeals to anti-big business liberals and anti-science conservatives. In Orange County in California, some schools have reported that up to 60% of five year olds are not fully vaccinated, while Republicans have seized on the issue as being about the rights of the individual over the greater good. Presidential candidate Rand Paul, a medical school graduate, has said that vaccinations can lead to “mental disorders” and should be “voluntary”. Wellness bloggers harp on a very similar theme, suggesting that the food industry is not to be trusted and that anyone who questions their dubious claims is probably in the pay of Big Pharma or Big Food. This is a favourite technique of the Food Babe, who has made disproven claims that her detractors have dodgy ties to chemical manufacturers. When the New Yorker’s science correspondent Michael Specter questioned Indian environmentalist Vandana Shiva’s spiritual campaign against GM crops, Shiva suggested that Specter is “sponsored by the GMO movement”. The more they are debunked – and the Food Babe, for one, has been so repeatedly and brilliantly – the more they are validated in their belief that they are speaking the truth that an unspecified They doesn’t want us to hear. To be an inexperienced, uneducated outsider is now to be a trustworthy expert: it’s a trick familiar to anyone who has watched the rise of the Tea Party and Ukip. It’s easy to mock wellness bloggers and their fattening apples, but their uneducated bletherings about food and health are, at best, irresponsible and, at heart, immoral. They’re right: what we eat is important, which is why it’s important people with qualifications beyond an Instagram account educate us about it. Honestly, these bloggers make me sentimental for the days when a £30,000 terracotta pot, not a gluten-free diet, was a lifestyle statement.",,0.249493620414673

Europe currently imports around 58 GM products from abroad, mostly US maize, cotton, soy bean and sugar beet. But Greenpeace said that the US has raised the issue of a large logjam in biotech authorisations in talks over a free trade deal known as TTIP. “With transatlantic trade talks ongoing, pressure has been mounting from the biotech industry and the US government to break open the EU market to GM imports and to speed up authorisation procedures,” Marco Contiero, Greenpeace EU’s agriculture director, told the Guardian. “The possible authorisation of 17 GM crops by the commission in the next few days is a likely result of this pressure.” “The timing is still being discussed but it is just a question of internal procedure now,” a source familiar with the discussions told the Guardian. “It is clear that the 17 strains will be authorised at the same time as the review meeting or just after. I would say it will happen before the end of May for sure.” Under proposed new GM import rules seen by the Guardian, future authorisations would automatically follow approval of new strains by the European Food and Safety Agency (Efsa). Individual countries would be given a similar opt-out to the one agreed for GM cultivation in a law passed earlier this year. “It will be up to each member state wanting to make use of this ‘opt-out’ to develop this justification on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the GMO [genetically-modified organism] in question, the type of measure envisaged and the specific circumstances at national or regional level that can justify such an opt-out,” the draft said. Opposition from some EU states to draft GM authorisations is “usually not based on science but on other considerations reflecting the societal debate existing in the country,” the commission argues. So opt-outs will not be granted to EU states who seek it on health or environmental grounds, after Efsa has deemed a product safe. “The scope for the exceptions [opt-outs] will probably be less than in the cultivation proposal because we are talking about the internal market here,” an informed source said. “You will have to have a really solid reason. Otherwise it would be attacked as a disruption to the market.” But biotech industry groups are opposed to the measure, fearing that it would prevent the free movement of GM imports in practice, as countries found ways to opt-out on technicalities, such as claiming trace residues of unauthorised strains in shipment containers. The 17 products include animal feeds as well as food for human consumption. “This would be another licence to ban safe products,” Beat Späth, the director for agricultural biotechnology at the EuropaBio trade association told the Guardian. “We import to the EU over 33m tonnes of GM commodities per year, mainly to feed our farm animals. If countries impose unjustified bans on products that have been used by farmers for 15 years, where are our farmers supposed to get their feed from?” Gloria Gabellini, deputy secretary general of the Coceral grain importers federation added: “We fear that this approach would reverse the achievements of European customs union and the single market. We have a single market so if you import a product, it must be entitled to free circulation.” Greenpeace also opposes the review proposal, arguing that this constitutes an assault on the ability of democratically-elected governments to protect their environments and peoples from potential risks, where the science is contested. Efsa has never refused a GM authorisation. The campaign group also said that the proposal breaks a promise by the EU president Jean-Claude Juncker last year that the review would focus on “laws that oblige the commission to authorise genetically modified organisms, even when a majority of national governments is against this.” The trigger for this was a vote in February on the GM maize strain known as 1507, opposed by 19 countries and supported by five. France and other countries were angry that the commission could have given 1507 a green light for cultivation regardless, under existing qualified majority voting rules. “The proposal undermines Juncker’s plan to bring the EU closer to its citizens,” Contiero said. “It fails to address major opposition to GM crops among public opinion and ignores concerns raised by national scientific bodies on the safety of GM crops.”",,0.07083741729968147
88,article,sustainable-business/2015/feb/20/craft-beer-movement-big-breweries,Guardian Sustainable Business,2015-02-20,What craft beer can teach the brewery big boys,https://gu.com/p/45qnp,,What craft beer can teach the brewery big boys,"<p>Europe’s growing craft beer movement cuts down on beer miles, provides jobs and creates demand for local ingredients<br></p>",1018,"Beer is one of the oldest drinks in human history. The Sumerians had a beer goddess, Ninkasi, and the world’s oldest known barley beer dates to 3,400BC. Beer is now highly industrialised and today a handful of companies control most of the market. Heineken for example, is responsible for around 9% of global beer production and Carlsberg, 6%. But now, a European craft beer market has come of age and smaller independent breweries are gaining attention. Sebastian Mergel, co-founder of Berlin’s Bierfabrik and president of the Global Association of Craft Beer Brewers (GACBB), points out that Europe has always had a network of small, independent breweries, but in the face of the beer behemoths, they got lost in the mix. Things are changing though, and over the past five years the number of European breweries has grown by 73%, invigorating the market and encouraging people to drink locally made beer. “[If] you buy local beer, you’re cutting down on beer miles, you’re helping your spend stay in the local economy,” says Jon Kyme of Stringers Beer in Cumbria, northern England. Craft beer production is often cited for its sustainability benefits but brewing on a smaller scale isn’t always as efficient. “It’s a fact that small-scale brewing is a bit problematic – it’s hard for a small brewer to be as efficient in water or power usage as the mega brewers,” says Kyme. “Of course, us little brewers know this is a problem, and a lot of us make extra effort where we can.” For Kyme, this means working with Good Energy to ensure that all of the power used at the brewery comes from renewable sources. Waste is another area where brewers can act sustainably. Kyme, much like many other brewers big and small, sends off his spent grain – the leftovers of beer production – to a local farm, where it’s consumed by pigs, and hops waste goes to a local allotment where it’s turned into compost. N17 in Ireland takes this a step further, focusing on what other products can be made from the brewing process. For Sarah Roarty, N17’s founder, everything has value and spent grain from her beers has gone into growing mushrooms, making granola bars and even dog biscuits. “You end up with not just one product for sale but four different products,” she explains. Beyond environmental sustainability, craft beer has benefits for the economy and communities. According to the Brewers of Europe, more than 5,000 breweries are responsible for more than 2m jobs on the continent, from “grain to glass”. “Consumers can be sure that the money they spend in local structures will help their direct neighbourhood to grow,” says Mergel. What’s exciting for beer lovers is that the renewed appreciation for craft beer is bringing the art of beer brewing back to life. In terms of what they brew, craft brewers are much more nimble than their larger counterparts. Mergel points to a project that the GACBB did, getting seven breweries around the world to develop a recipe together before brewing it at their various breweries with different yeasts to give it a local flavour. For him, “brewing with other brewers is like a jam session, but instead of guitars and drums we use hops and malt to improvise.” “Certainly brewing on a very small scale costs more per litre than larger scale operations,” says Scott Williams of Scotland’s Williams Bros Brewing Co. “We can however be much more experimental.” Williams Bros focuses on old recipes and local ingredients, recreating ales brewed centuries ago which would have only been brewed using plants, flowers and spices picked locally. This includes the brewery’s Fraoch Heather Ale, for which it picks the heather themselves. In Spain, the Menduiña brewery also uses local ingredients that a “consumer can recognise as their own cuisine,” says brewer Alberte Fernandez-Perez. Its beers are unfiltered and GMO free, and the brewery has its own hops production on site. While still in its infancy, the goal is that eventually the brewery will produce 25% of its hops on site. Around 2,600 farms in the EU grow hops, with most of hops production taking place in Germany. Global hops production has declined in the last five years. However, a growing interest in flavour hops – those varieties that give beer a distinct, and mostly fruity note – has the craft beer sector some growth. In the US, with the huge craft beer market demand, the trend has been to pull out high alpha hop crops, and replace them with aroma hops. Countries like Germany have tried to compensate for that by growing more high alpha crops, and craft brewers often get popular aroma hop varieties like Citra and Cascade from the US. Yet thanks to a growing European interest in these more flavourful beers, the production of aroma hops in Europe is gradually increasing. “It’s really important to grow our own varieties to create interesting flavour in the beer,” says Florian Perschel of the German-based Barth-Haas Group, the world’s largest supplier of hop products and services. “In the future there will be more varieties.” Deck and Donohue, a brewery that opened in 2014 just outside the centre of Paris, has been experimenting with a variety of local ingredients and even hand-harvesting Strisselspalt hops in Alsace for one of its beers. “Contrary to wine, beer can be produced pretty much anywhere, and very close to where customers actually are. This proximity enables more interaction,” says co-founder Thomas Deck. And this is what makes craft beer so special. The whole process, and final product, has the ability to engage consumers in a way that its industrial counterparts simply can’t. Consumers are putting increasing value on knowing where their products have come from, and craft beer nearly always comes with a great story from a person passionate about their profession.

89,article,sustainable-business/2015/feb/16/sex-condoms-green-supply-chain-chemicals,Guardian Sustainable Business,2015-02-16,Greener sex? Condoms experience 'a sustainable renaissance',https://gu.com/p/45z7g,,Greener sex? Condoms experience 'a sustainable renaissance',"<p>From irritating chemicals to a troubled supply chain, condoms haven’t always been the kindest to the earth or our bodies. A new crop of companies is trying to change that</p>",855,"If green is your thing, consider yourself in the golden age of sex products. Condoms, in particular, are in the midst of a sustainable renaissance. “If it wasn’t a big challenge, then it wouldn’t be much fun.” So says Jeffrey Hollender, founder and ex-leader of Seventh Generation and current co-founder and CEO of sustainable condom company – wait for it – Sustain. Sustain condoms advertise the company’s responsible sourcing of the rubber to make latex, the Fairtrade-certified facility that manufactures those condoms – with no toxic chemicals in the end product – and the company’s donation of 10% of pre-tax profits to women’s health and reproductive services. Hollender knows a thing or two about getting out in front of big issues, having grown Seventh Generation to $150m in revenues per year while also developing and even creating the market for greener cleaners. “The challenges [with responsible condoms] are similar to what we saw with Seventh Generation 25 years ago – we’re solving important problems that people don’t know exist,” Hollender says. “People aren’t saying, ‘I’m really concerned about child labor in the condom industry; I’d better buy fair trade.’” Hollender’s Sustain, which he started with his wife Sheila and his daughter Meika, hopes to change that. Sustain has reimagined the process by which condoms are made, emphasizing social, environmental and personal responsibility. Touting B Corp, Fairtrade, vegan, non-GMO, FSC and Peta certifications, Hollender says that Sustain’s model can revamp the condoms supply chain, from tree to … wood. Sustain is not alone, however. A whole gang of companies are coming to grips with sustainability in the condom supply chain, including Einhorn, French Letter and L Condoms, which also offers one-hour condom delivery by bike messengers. There’s much more to L than just on-demand (and low-carbon) condom delivery. L’s founder, Talia Frenkel, launched the company after witnessing first-hand the ravages of the global Aids crisis, particularly for women in the developing world. The company started with a grand idea, but building it into a responsible product has been a labor of love and now it has gotten results: L’s supply chain work earned the company a Best for the World award from B Corporation in 2014. L embraced the one-for-one model pioneered by Toms Shoes and Warby Parker eyewear: for every condom purchased, L donates a condom to organizations in several African nations. In Uganda, donated condoms offer women entrepreneurship opportunities to serve as sex educators and condom distributors, selling condoms at below-market rates while also spreading the word about safe sex. In addition to the social benefit L is promoting, Frenkel pushed to make the condoms and their packaging as green as possible. The company’s condoms contain no parabens, no nonoxynol-9, and no other potentially harmful chemicals, and packaging is minimalist, 100% recycled and 100% recyclable. “Our focus in changing these product attributes is to make the experience better; we don’t talk about parabens,” Frenkel says. “Eco-sex is really about better sex, it’s about a healthier, greener lifestyle.” Just how much of a difference all these greener condoms will make is hard to say. The global condom market is dominated by Church &amp; Dwight (the makers of Trojan and other brands), and the condom industry sucks up just a tiny fraction of the world’s rubber production. But there is a trickle-up benefit to making rubber production greener – from the Sustains and Ls of the world up the condom food chain and into the larger industry. Perhaps most importantly, the world needs widespread education campaigns in order to increase condom use, which will help grow the impacts of more sustainable rubbers. A 2010 study found that less than one-quarter of people used a condom during intercourse. Although the numbers are far higher for those most likely to be non-monogamous, such as adolescents and unmarried adults, that still offers a lot of room for improvement. And if green condoms suffer from the same performance concerns that other green products do, a good first step would be to reassure shoppers that because condoms are medical devices, they undergo stiff testing requirements prior to regulatory approval (such as by the Food and Drug Administration in the US). And condoms are not the only game in the greener bedroom. There are many other toys and tools that make their ways into sex – and into our bodies. This broader sustainability transition centers on removing toxic chemicals from products that come in contact with our most sensitive parts. Good Vibrations, a Bay area-based retailer of sex products, has developed an entire line of green goods. The company’s Ecorotic products – covering everything from lubes and condoms to toys and tools of all types – are made with an emphasis on cleaner, safer and more sustainable materials. “Materials are key,” says Jackie Rednour-Bruckman, an executive vice president at Good Vibrations. “There is a groundswell of consciousness around this, given that people care about what’s in their food and in their beauty products. Why wouldn’t they care about other things that they put in their bodies?” The sustainable living hub is funded by Unilever.

GM serves as a proxy and arena for a dizzying range of debates in the EU splitting industry and environmentalists. These cover trade deals, agricultural herbicide use, subsidiarity (dealing with social issues at a local level), evidence-based science and the precautionary principle. With an average GM crop costing between $200m-$300m to bring to market, and potential returns that run into billions, lobbyists on all sides are sharpening their pencils in the corridors of Brussels. The first item on their agenda may be a commission review of GM authorisation rules expected by May. The EU’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker, ordered the rethink into ways that GM authorisations could be blocked after states criticised the current need for a qualified majority of EU leaders at Council meetings. The health and food safety commissioner, Vytenis Andriukaitis, has already alarmed biotech industries by suggesting that current legislation creates “conflict” because it ignores sovereignty and subsidiarity. There are also trade issues, with the US viewing EU regulation on GM as a trade barrier. Negotiators have exerted pressure for a freer regime in talks on the Transatlantic free trade deal known as TTIP, and the EU’s agriculture commissioner, Phil Hogan, felt obliged to pledge last week that Europe would continue to label GM products under any future TTIP deal. The new GM rules which MEPs voted in favour of last week should come into force this spring, but they cut two ways. They allow countries to grow GM crops that have first been authorised by the European Food Safety Authority (Efsa), but enable states to ban single GM crops on the basis of evidence that does not contradict an Efsa opinion. The details of how new biotech regimes in the EU will be constructed, enforced – and, crucially, how liability will be allocated within them - remain sketchy, with questions of cross-border protection to the fore. “If, as expected, the [UK] government uses this new legislation to approve more GM then there needs to be adequate separation distances between GM and non GM crops to protect the environment from contamination,” the Green MEP Keith Taylor told the Guardian. The issue could spark rows between countries – and within the UK too, as England is far keener on GM cultivation than Scotland or Wales. GM-sceptic states such as France and Hungary are likely to prohibit cultivation on their land, but environmentalists expect some of the 19 countries which rejected authorisation of Dupont Pioneer’s “Supercorn” GM Maize 1507 last February to wilt before the high bar set for banning GM produce under the new rules. Cross-pollination from GM crops can take place through seeds carried by the wind, animals, vehicles or people, as well as from storage silos that have not been scrubbed clean. Efsa recommends buffer zones and rotation schemes to confine GM crops to cultivation fields, but campaigners view the 200 metres separation distance favoured by the UK as inadequate, proposing buffer zones measured in kilometres instead. It is unclear when the eight crops in the regulatory pipeline may receive their final green lights. Those closest to market, such as GM Maize 1507, have insect-resistant qualities not relevant to conditions in the UK. Greenpeace says it expects pro-GM English farmers to make a point by planting them in 2016 anyway. The chair of Efsa’s GMO panel, Professor Joe Perry said that he thought another herbicide-resistance Dupont GM Maize, known as 59122 would be “quite appropriate for UK”. It is at an advanced stage of its regulatory passage. “There would be a lot of interest among UK farmers in growing it, because maize is quite vulnerable when it is just coming out of the ground,” he told the Guardian. Much of the GM debate involves the herbicide resistant nature of such crops – and the licensed toxins that agribusiness include in their GM packages. “If you use these herbicides too much or without proper management, the weeds you are trying to kill can evolve a resistance – a bit like antibiotic resistance,” Perry said. “The herbicide-tolerant GM systems are also so efficient at killing weeds that they can lead to a reduction in biodiversity – in weeds and the insects that live among them - and therefore a reduction in food for farmland birds.” The question of whether GM crops encourage plant-resistance and the over-use of toxic herbicides such as glyphosate and glufosinate has been a hotter potato than BASF’s GM Amflora spud (which the EU authorised, and was subsequently banned by the EU General Court). Glufosinate is due to be prohibited across the EU from 2017, although GM Maize 59122 has been designed to tolerate it. The EU’s chief scientific adviser, Ann Glover, drew ire from environmentalists when she said that the EU’s long-standing precautionary principle was “no longer relevant” for GM, and that it would be “unethical” not to use such biotech produce when other approaches had failed, because of the role that GM could play in alleviating global hunger. Glover will be leaving her position at the end of this month, partly because of the fallout from her clashes with green NGOs over GM and endocrine disrupting chemicals. In a sign of the stakes at play, British Conservative MEPs last week threatened a spat with the commission if her chief scientific adviser position was not maintained, after she has gone.",,0.04733477633477633

The new EU law, which comes into force this spring, will allow states to cultivate GM crops that have already been approved by the European Food Safety Authority (Efsa). According to Sarah Cundy, the UK’s head of GM policy and regulation, that could happen quickly. “We now expect to see GM maize 1507 get its final authorisation in the near future, and new applications should be approved much more quickly than has been the case until now,” she said in an email to the National Farmers Union, which the Guardian has seen. The Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder welcomed the new rules, which passed with a 48o-159 majority on Tuesday, as a decentralisation of power. “We are keeping strict safeguards in place but the decision on whether or not to grow approved genetically modified crops is being returned to national governments,” she said. “This will give us a stronger legal framework in which countries, farmers and scientists can work.” Last year, EU ministers voted to allow cultivation of DuPont Pioneer’s ‘Supercorn’, also known as GM Maize 1507, after Efsa approved it despite concerns about the effects it might have on beneficial insects such as butterflies and moths. Efsa recommended addressing these with risk mitigation measures such as crop rotation and field buffer zones. Another email from the environment minister Lord de Mauley to the Beyond GM campaigning group promises “pragmatic rules” for separating GM and non-GM crops to allow product labelling, and does not foresee commercial planting of crops “for at least a few years”. Ecologists see this as a tacit nod for GM cultivation in the 2017 planting season if the Conservatives win the next election, although the Labour party also views biotechnology as a way to strengthen the UK’s food chain and reduce environmental damage, if it has public support. But Marco Contiero, Greenpeace’s agriculture policy director said it would be “irresponsible” for Supercorn to be given a green light across Europe before national opt-out legislation had also entered into force. “The GM crop would encourage use of a herbicide so toxic that it will be banned in Europe by 2017,” he told the Guardian. A spokeswoman for the UK’s Department for Food, Agriculture and Rural Affairs played down the chances of new GM applications coming to market soon, as eight of those in the pipeline were for maize strains that are resistant to pests not found in the UK. The chair of Efsa’s GMO panel, Professor Joe Perry said that its 20 academic experts would provide a stringent regulatory buffer against any threat to the environment or human health. “Half a billion European consumers can be assured that when an opinion declares food from a GM crop plant to be safe, it can be consumed with confidence,” he said. “The current delay in approvals to import and cultivate GM crops within the EU is due to political disagreements, not due to disagreements over the quality of the risk assessments.” But Green MEPs were sceptical about what the revised rules would mean in practice. “It’s a good thing that EU countries will have new powers to ban GMOs. However, what this means in reality for the UK is more GMOs not less,” said Keith Taylor, the Green MEP for south-east England. “This is because our pro-GM government will now be able to give the go-ahead to more authorisations.” Friends of the Earth’s food campaigner, Clare Oxborrow, said: “This decision is good news for nations like Scotland and Wales, whose political leaders have opposed GM crops and can now ban them from their fields. But this ruling is a double-edged sword that could open the door to GM crops being grown in England.” The new law does allow governments to opt out of GM cultivation either by negotiating with the firms for a territorial exclusion, which the companies may refuse, or by imposing national bans on single crops – which the companies can challenge. In practice, environmentalists fear that countries wishing to ban GM will face protracted national court cases that graduate to the European court of justice and afford corporate protagonists equal or greater rights to national governments. “General environmental policy objectives can be used to justify a ban under the amended directive, but they must be distinct from the environmental impacts that Efsa has already looked at,” Contiero said. “This means that EU states may face a de facto prohibition on citing environmental impact assessments they have themselves conducted in their own territories.” Several European countries led by France and Hungary have GM bans in place, but others such as Britain and Spain have vocally supported the technology, with the UK abstaining from the final vote because of its provisions for GM embargoes. “We are concerned that these national bans may deter new applications from coming forward,” Cundy said in her email. “We feel that the deal’s mandatory co-existence measures on borders between those member states who are cultivating GM crops and those that are not are too restrictive.” The UK, however, has not cultivated GM maize.",,0.11143157768157769

As part of the transatlantic trade agreement being negotiated behind closed doors, trade groups have recommended policies – under the banner of lifting trade barriers – that could impact pesticide regulations in both the US and the European Union. The proposals put forward by CropLife America and the European Crop Protection Association would reduce protection compared to the more stringent pesticide standards already in place in the EU and in individual US states, said the Center for International Environmental Law, or Ciel. “If adopted, these recommendations will thwart pesticide regulation that is vital for protecting workers, consumers and communities,” said Erica Smith, the report’s lead author. Advocates for the US organic food business believe such a policy could jeopardize the value of their products. In 2013, US sales of organic food products were $35.1bn, up more than 11% from 2012 and worth nearly three times more than US agricultural exports to the EU. In the EU, as well as in individual EU member countries and US states, the industry recommendations would relax regulations and standards that protect health and the environment, Smith said. “The pretext of ‘regulatory convergence’ and ‘regulatory cooperation’ [is] industry jargon for adopting the lowest common denominator”, Smith said. CropLife America and ECPA – trade associations representing major agricultural chemical manufacturers, including BASF, BayerCrop Science, Dow AgroSciences, DuPont Crop Protection, Monsanto and Syngenta Crop Protection – claim the policy would help eliminate or reduce barriers to trade and promote regulatory cooperation in keeping with the goals of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). The groups recommend adopting the US system of chemical risk assessment that, in Ciel’s analysis, allows the use of at least 82 pesticides currently banned in the EU. Among these are pesticides recognized as carcinogens, developmental toxins and suspected endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Debbie Barker, international director at the Center for Food Safety, said the recommended policy’s risk-assessment-based approachruns “counter to the EU’s precautionary principle approach toward agricultural pesticide approvals”. Adopting the risk-based approach, Barker said, “would result in a downward spiral of safeguards vis-à-vis agricultural chemicals currently in place in the EU”. CropLife America, however, said its proposed policy “will ensure the highest levels of consumer and environmental protection while promoting international trade, creating jobs and enhancing social and economic viability”. It noted that a proposed EU policy restricting endocrine disrupters could block more than $4bn, or 40%, of US agricultural exports to the EU. In addition, the industry proposal recommends that the maximum levels of pesticide residues allowed on food conform to those permitted in the US. In some cases, these levels are hundreds of times higher than those currently allowed in the EU, according to the report. The proposal could, according to Ciel, interfere with current moratoriums by the EU and some US local governments on use of the neonicotinoid pesticides thought to be contributing to worldwide bee population declines. Poor pollinator health is already negatively impacting farmers worldwide, said Jim Kleinschmit, director of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy’s Climate and Energy Initiatives. The CropLife America-ECPA proposal also called for an international confidential business information policy that Cielsaid could interfere with public health protections and development of safer chemicals. Such a policy could also make it harder to ensure products are free from pesticides, said Robert Anderson, senior trade adviser at the Organic Trade Association. “How do you test for it if you don’t know what it is?” . That an international trade agreement could change so many existing regulations would be “unprecedented,” said report co-author and Ciel senior attorney Baskut Tuncak. “Some will argue that this will provide some people will the opportunity to sell more into the EU,” said US Congressional Representative Chellie Pingree of the industry proposal. But, she said: “That will be agribusiness giants, not farm families, who are selling organic products, antibiotic-free meat, GMO-labeled products.” Adds Pingree, a member of the Congressional Appropriations Committee and subcommittee on agricultural appropriations, this proposal is “counter what American consumers are saying by way of their purchases that they want”. Because the negotiations are secret, it’s unclear if this proposal is being considered by the TTIP negotiators. Neither the US trade representative’s office nor the European Commission responded to a question about whether it was being discussed.

And why not jazz it up with bee pollen or some fermented tree-nut cheese? Introducing an early contender for the year’s most ridic food trend</p>,540,"As a joke, the other day I wrote on Twitter: “This year’s hottest food trend: Gruel. From high end restaurants to street-side gruel trucks, gruel will be everywhere in 2015.” I was taking the piss out of the kind of food-as-fashion writing which proclaims things like “Indian is the new Korean”, “harissa is the new sriracha” and “the next quinoa is millet” (OK, those last two were from the same article). Immediately I was informed that artisanal (non-GMO, gluten free) gruel is already a thing in Australia. Bondi – of course – even played host to a pop-up porridge store last year. Frankly, I wasn’t surprised. Gruel, which is basically just cereal boiled with water or milk, is the perfect fashion food. What could be more authentic than a dish first popularised by the gaunt and fashionably scruffy Oliver Twist in 1838? And in these nutritionally conscious times, gruel is an all-rounder. It’s got all the carbs and water you need to barely survive for another day. For the health-conscious gruel can be made more interesting by adding bee pollen, maca, hemp seeds, coconut butter, lentil sprouts or fermented tree-nut cheese. Nutritional and historical cred aside, the existence of artisanal gruel doesn’t surprise me because nothing food-related could surprise me anymore. Our food culture is impossible to parody. Like any other aspect of human culture, food has always been affected by trends, changing tastes and technological development. Haute cuisine has its movements. Lobster was once a food for prisoners. The cappuccino appeared in Women’s Weekly cookbooks as an exotic desert (made in a pan). Gastronomy has gone from niche interest to middle-class pastime. Food is everywhere and is more than ever a status symbol. Every Instagrammed restaurant meal and dinner party spread says “look at me, I have so much money and leisure time”. The ubiquity and elevated status of food in our culture means the natural process of change has gone a bit mad. Foams and airs were everywhere just a few years ago, now they’re considered cringeworthy. Consumers rush so quickly to trendy foods that in recent times there has been a shortage of kale (now alleviated, thank God) and the prices of chia and quinoa have skyrocketed (prompting some excellent Guardian headlines). None of this would be so bad (well, unless you’re a starving Bolivian villager who can no longer afford quinoa), but it has to be so earnest. Eating locally and shopping at farmers’ markets can’t simply be about getting fresh food, it has to be about saving the bloody world. Forget the fact that most people have neither the time nor the money. On a more basic level, buying into food fashion too much is just going to decrease your enjoyment of food. Who cares that Mexican is, like, so 2012? It’s delicious. That’s not to say that we should ignore food fashion. Trying new cooking techniques can be a blast. Eating new things is one of life’s great experiences. Maybe I’ll be proved wrong by this gruel trend. After all, I had a pork congee in Vietnam last year that had me tugging my forelock and returning, bowl in hand, to ask for more. Better start working on that list of hot food trends for 2016.",,0.18705260148656375

We spoke to them about big business, Ferguson and why Monsanto is like god in the Old Testament</p>",1401,"Walk into Joe’s Pub on a Sunday afternoon this month, and you may feel like you stepped into a revival meeting. Reverend Billy and the Stop Shopping Choir have returned for a six-week residency at the Public Theater’s performance venue to perform their latest show, Monsanto Is The Devil. While appropriating the character of the Christian televangelist pastor, popularised by Jimmy Swaggart in the 1970-1980s, Reverend Billy delivers a radically different message. In the past, he and the Stop Shopping Choir have led “exorcisms” of cash registers and the Tate Modern. Last year, Reverend Billy and the musical director of the group, Nehemiah Luckett, were arrested and charged with riot, trespass, unlawful assembly and disorderly conduct after a performance in the Manhattan branch lobby of JP Morgan Chase. This Thanksgiving saw Reverend Billy and the Stop Shopping Choir make a visit to St Louis, Missouri, where they hosted an organic meal on the front lawn of Monsanto’s headquarters, before joining protesters from Ferguson. I spoke with Reverend Billy (AKA Billy Talen), activist and lead performer, and Savitri D, the director of the project to discuss their work and the connections they see between human rights and earth rights. What are your backgrounds? Billy Talen: In the 1970s-1980s, I primarily did monologues, which was a performance form that defined that time. The monologuing gradually became the character, and the monologuing became sermons. Savitri D: Both of us came from different sectors of the theatre world. In Billy’s case, it was performance art, and in my case, it was dance and straight theater. How did New York City contribute to the formation of the Reverend Billy and the Stop Shopping Choir ? SD: Both of us were responding to the conditions we found ourselves in the late 1990s in New York City, during the Giulani era, as neo-liberalism creeped into the city and as Clintonian economics saturated the environment around us. I think both of us arrived to this project from the problem of being an artist under those conditions and also the problem of other people living in this state under those conditions. From looking around and seeing the massive racial profiling taking place to the attempt to create a perfect shopping moment in the city, it was destroying the lives of human beings and small business owners. All these things were coinciding and, as an artist, you have that moment where you realise there’s an imperative to respond. Why did you decide to model your performative actions on Christian church services? SD: Let’s face it: the US is a Christian nation. And while televangelists are not as ascendant at this moment as they’ve been in the past, they were an important part of the culture in 1980s, and even, 1990s. They were speaking with the president at the White House, and they were all about their righteousness on TV and the radio. But often it was a very self-invented form, some of these preachers didn’t go to seminary, they invented themselves. The self-invented preacher and the self-invented church is an old, old American tradition. Billy was stepping into that. How did the Stop Shopping Choir form? SD: The choir appeared around Billy, when he preaching on the street in Times Square. I think the choir grew organically as Billy shouted on the street and people agreed.The choir came out of reality; it came out people stepping forward, and saying yes. It’s really fascinating to think of what a chorus is and the role it plays in theater. It is the conscience, and it is the true credible voice because it’s multiple voices. Why is your latest show titled Monsanto Is The Devil? BT: We feel that Monsanto threatens people with pests and weeds, and then sells people their pesticide coated, DNA-spliced idea of corn. Basically, they are teaching people to distrust nature and distrust the natural world. When you don’t trust the natural world, you create climate change. Monsanto’s actions defeat the ability of the local ecosystem to recycle CO2 into the plants and trees, which are major storage sequesteration sites for our vegetation. Organic farmers will tell you that that’s one of the basic ideas of their farming method: to cycle the atmosphere into the soil. Do you see any connections between the fundamentalist church and Monsanto? BT: The heart of the issue here is that Monsanto is like an Old Testament God, who comes to you and says: “Trust me, you’re in trouble, you’re going to die, so turn your faith over to me and you will be my chosen people. But you have to agree to sign up with me, I’m your only God.” Many Americans are fed up with the fundamentalist God, and learning to trust life as it is given to us here, on Earth. You have to stop being afraid of it. You have to trust it, and it with bear you up. I’m trying to dismantle that old Jimmy Swaggart faith of “Be very afraid, and give me your money.” On your site, you recognise two other devils, consumerism and miltarism, could you talk about why you believe those two are the devils of society? SD: From the perspective someone in the United States, consumerism is how we operate. It’s a domestic tactic, and militarism is the foreign tactic of this neoliberal agenda. It’s the corporatisation of our democracy. In this system, the only way to save the economy is to shop more, to create more retail jobs instead of real jobs, which further fosters our incredible debt. Even if we did want to exert our citizen force here in the US, we can’t because the democracy is so corporatised. Look at the last election cycle, and how much money was poured into advocating against the GMO labelling law. BT: There is also foreign impact of these policies and how militarism operates with the expansion of these companies in other territories. The expansion of the factory farm has terrible implications for climate change. Something that really stood out was the line: ‘Death by invisible toxins isn’t really that different than death by visible bullets,’ when Ferguson was brought up. Could you explain this idea? SD: First, it’s important to value the life and death that’s going on in Ferguson as much as we can, and elevate the reality of that crisis in this moment. We could talk about the connections in theoretical ways, but those are real lives. BT: We had been planning to come to the St Louis area for months, partly in partnership with the Organic Consumer Association, to educate and organise around organic farming and food. And then Ferguson happened next door. In the past couple of months, several of us have gone, and we raised money for them with a Joan Baez concert. We hope we can help in some modest degree. SD: That said, Billy and I have been talking a lot before Ferguson, before Michael Brown was shot, were talking about how we can connect human justice with earth justice. Both are essentially created by the same set of problems: corporatised democracy, steroidal capitalism, and racism. How do human justice and earth justice connect? BT: The basic problem of power, the most immediate issue is this big chemical company and across the way, there is a racist police department besieging their own community. But now, there is a coming together of human rights and earth rights. A lot of people believe these are separate issues, but we’re coming to the point where we have to have a single view of the violent occupation of the people by these elites. SD: There’s also an interesting use of ‘science’ in both cases, which also illuminates the connection between human and earth justice. Hugh Grant is the CEO of Monsanto, which is a science-based company. And in Ferguson, the grand jury decision was defended by ‘scientific evidence.’ [County prosecutor Bob] McCulloch essentially downplayed the witness accounts – provided by people – in favor of ‘scientific evidence.’ In both cases, it’s an elevation of elitist science. This is also a problem of our times, the concept that science is more credible. It limits our political process in some ways; it’s like saying, “Don’t question this, the system is trustworthy – it’s scientific.” Reverend Billy and the Stop Shopping Choir will be performing Monsanto is the Devil on Sundays at Joe’s Pub through 21 December .",,0.08306372199229344
96,article,sustainable-business/2014/dec/01/cargill-food-local-organic-agriculture,Guardian Sustainable Business,2014-12-01,'Trade facilitates sustainability': The trouble with the local food movement,https://gu.com/p/43n8h,,'Trade facilitates sustainability': The trouble with the local food movement,<p>The globalized food system has many known ills - but is the alternative any better? Marc Gunther talks to Cargill executive chairman Greg Page about the problem with “local” produce</p>,985,"Long before Greg Page became the executive chairman of Cargill, one of the world’s largest food companies, the company dispatched him to Thailand to build a chicken plant in a rural province north of Bangkok. “It was a chance”, he said, “to start a business from scratch in an overseas location, while having access to the resources of Cargill”. Plus, he noted with a smile, he was “12 hours from headquarters ... I loved it”. Today, Cargill Meats Thailand imports soymeal from Brazil and Argentina to feed chickens, which are raised, slaughtered, processed, cooked and frozen into a wide range of products, most destined for restaurants and supermarkets in Japan, Europe, Canada and Hong Kong. Chicken parts that don’t appeal to western appetites — feet, heads and the like — are consumed locally or exported to nearby Asian markets. To locavores who want to look their farmer in the eye, to the advocates of food sovereignty, and to those who argue that ‘cooking solves everything’, this is a nightmarish way to produce food. But to Greg Page, who has spent 41 years at Cargill and is now its executive chairman, global trade in food and agriculture is not only good for producers and consumers — it’s also a key element of a sustainable food system. “Trade facilitates sustainability,” Page said when we met recently at Cargill’s Washington DC office. “The world was not endowed with good soil and good rainfall equally. You want to move production to the right soil and the right climate, where it belongs.” Why grow coffee in California? This, of course, is what you’d expect a Cargill employee to say. Food remains predominantly a regional business — roughly 80% of all food is consumed in the country where it’s grown, and most of its is grown by small-scale farmers — but when food does cross borders, Cargill is likely to play a role. The privately-held company, which has 145,000 employees working in 67 countries, generated about $135bn in revenue in the 2014 fiscal year, much of it by moving such commodities as corn, soy, wheat, sugar palm oil, cocoa and meat from places where they are grown to places where they are consumed. The Thailand chicken business is a case study in globalization. Once Thailand lifted trade barriers that made it hard to import soy, Cargill saw an opportunity, opening its first processing plant in 1989 to take advantage of the availability of low-cost labor. That investment, over time, led to the creation of 13,300 jobs in Thailand, expanded the market for soy grown by farmers in South America and delivered ready-to-eat chicken at affordable prices to consumers in Japan, Europe and Canada. “This is Adam Smith and Hayek and Ricardo played out at very high speed,” says Page, citing classical liberal economists who argued that trade generates the prosperity much of the world enjoys today. While many industries — apparel, electronics, toys — have been thoroughly globalized, trade in food and agriculture is far from unfettered. Tariffs and quotas protect US sugar producers from competition. Russia restricts imports of chicken from the US. Japan imposes stiff tariffs on imported rice and wheat. The European Union, meantime, has barred imports of animals injected with hormones and keeps out some GMO crops. Some of the trade barriers reflect geopolitical issues, others are purely protectionist and still others are justified by concerns over food safety or agricultural practices. “They are very real issues,” Page acknowledges. “Food is emotional.” But history indicates that the laws of nature will ultimately trump costly experiments in localism. In perhaps the most dramatic experiment in recent history, oil-rich Saudi Arabia spent billions of dollars in the 1970s to create a wheat industry using huge price supports, low-interest loans to farmers and cheap, subsidized water, eventually becoming one of the world’s largest exporters of wheat—quite an accomplishment in a country that receives an average of about four inches of rain a year, one of the lowest rates in the world. Needless to say, it couldn’t last — dwindling water resources led the kingdom to phase out subsidies in the late 2000s and it intends to halt all wheat production by 2016, in an effort to preserve its water. What’s more, the environmental benefits of buying local are unclear. A 2008 study found that transportation accounts for only 11% of food’s greenhouse gas emissions, with the final delivery segment from producer to market responsible for a mere 4%. Climate emissions depend on whether food is transported by plane, ship, train or truck. Says Page: “When a Ford 150 pickup pulls up to somebody’s house and drops off four pounds of tomatoes, I can assure you that the greenhouse gas footprint of that production model is not superior to conventional agriculture.” This isn’t to say that locally-grown food doesn’t deliver social and economic benefits. Cargill hosts a farmers’ market at its headquarters in Minneapolis, offering not just fresh fruits and vegetables but face-to-face encounters between farmers and consumers. The growth in local food production and farmers’ markets has “certainly been a net positive for rural employment in Minnesota, and in other places as well”, Page says. Agriculture is “going to remain a very local business”, Page says, but if water and climate emissions are fully priced into the cost of food, it will likely become more global over time. One thing’s certain — it will never again be all-local. After all, as economist Russ Roberts has said: “We tried buying local once. It was called the Middle Ages.” Read more like this: Business and entrepreneurs seize opportunities in rise of veganism Supermarkets’ struggle for economic survival must not come at expense of human rights In man v food, there can be no winner Eating challenges from around the world - in pictures The food hub is funded by The Irish Food Board.

97,article,sustainable-business/2014/nov/20/china-gmo-corn-boycott-markets,Guardian Sustainable Business,2014-11-20,China's GMO corn boycott: protecting consumers or protecting markets,https://gu.com/p/43ezk,,Is China's GMO corn ban protecting consumers or protecting markets?,"<p>As China closes its markets to many types of US corn, questions arise about the costs and benefits of genetically modified food<br></p>",1008,"For 42 years, Don Villwock has grown soybeans and corn on 4,000 acres in southwest Indiana. He has endured low prices, bad weather and trade embargoes. This year, however, he’s facing a new challenge: China. In March, China’s authorities stopped accepting exports of corn that contained a specific, very common genetic modification intended to make the plant resistant to insects. A few months later China also began rejecting dried distillers grain – a byproduct of ethanol production – that carried the trait. Villwock explains that, as a major market evaporated, prices tumbled, and farms across the US took a financial hit. “We’re one of them,” he says. “I got to see this movie from the front row.” Genetically modified foods have long been controversial. Opponents argue that these crops damage the environment, contribute to corporate control of food systems, and have not been proven safe for human consumption. Supporters counter that genetically engineered crops require less pesticide use and could be a key part of confronting rising food demand worldwide. China’s recent moves, however, raise questions about the global future of GMO crops. Ripples from a closed market The trait China rejected was developed by Syngenta, one of the major producers of genetically engineered seeds. Four years ago, they released it under the name Viptera; since then, it has been approved in most major markets, including the US and the generally GMO-shy European Union. China, however, has lagged on approving the trait. Earlier this year, they began cracking down on imports. Veronica Nigh, an economist for the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF), says that, in recent years, China has bought about 40% of the dried distillers grain produced in the US. But now, with Viptera unwelcome in China, many middlemen have become unwilling to buy any corn that might contain the trait, and many farmers have been left with surplus corn. In turn, the extra supply of corn in the market has driven down prices for all corn growers. “When your number one customer starts rejecting [your crop], the price drops quickly,” Nigh says. In response, the US Grains Council asked Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack to pressure China to approve the trait. Some critics, however, place the blame squarely on Syngenta for pushing a new trait before it was approved by a major trading partner. The North American Export Grain Association and the National Grain and Feed Association have asked Syngenta to cease marketing Viptera and another unapproved trait. International trading company Cargill and livestock feed exporter Trans Coastal have both sued the biotech giant, claiming expected losses of $90 million and $41 million, respectively. Syngenta did not respond to requests for comment, but has rejected responsibility on its website. David Morgan, president of Syngenta Seeds, has asserted that halting marketing of certain seeds at this point would be tantamount to giving a foreign nation control over US agricultural practices. At the moment, biotech companies are standing by the power of GMOs. Villwock says, however, that some farmers are considering a return to conventional seed next year rather than risk growing crops that prove unsellable. An economic power play? AFBF’s Nigh suggests that China has economic reasons for rejecting Viptera: Chinese corn farmers are experiencing significant surpluses right now, and slowing imports could help buoy prices for these growers. However, once the fear of GMOs is incited, she says, it is not easy to reverse. “Long-term, our concern is that it slows down the abilities of US farmers to adopt the newest and best technology available to them,” she says. Monsanto, a major seed producer that is not currently having trouble with China, is still developing GMO traits. But Rob Fraley, the company’s chief technology officer, points out that it has also been dedicating a growing portion of its budget – currently over 50% – to “advanced breeding” programs. Whereas GMO seeds generally contain altered DNA or genetic code from other species, this new program is more like an accelerated, science-aided version of old fashioned breeding: scientists use gene mapping techniques to identify desired traits in plants, making it easier for breeders to select for these characteristics. “They can breed faster, they can breed more precisely, they can map and tag breeding traits – but it’s not a GMO,” Fraley says. These techniques have already produced an antioxidant-boosting broccoli that is just coming to market, Fraley says, noting that other varieties that offer enhanced nutrition, better flavor, and other desirable traits are also in development. There are also promising alternatives to genetically modified crops, says Bill Freese, a science policy analyst for the Center for Food Safety. Farming practices known as ecological agriculture – including crop rotation and the planting of cover crops – can help keep weeds at bay, making it unnecessary to plant herbicide-resistant GMO seeds. Moreover, he explains, conventional breeding programs have produced the kinds of drought-tolerant and enhanced-nutrition strains promised by genetic engineering. However, none of these new varieties have yet been able to gain traction in the market because the breeders, many of whom are publicly funded, don’t have the money or clout to compete with GMO producers, he says. Even with the challenges they’re facing, GMOs are likely to stick around. Genetically modified crops make up nearly 90% of the corn grown in the US. And, according to a recent study by the Georg-August-University of Goettingen, GMO seed has increased yields by 22% and farmers’ profits by 68%. Many farmers are planning to stick with their GMO seeds. When prices are low, Villwock says, it just makes sense to use the seeds with the highest yields. And, in his experience, those are genetically modified crops. “There’s no doubt the economics lean towards planting a GMO crop,” Villwock says. “We will stay planting GMOs on our farm.” Sarah Shemkus is a freelance reporter and editor who writes about business, technology, food and the places where they all meet.

But does that mean we should grow them? Karl Mathiesen investigates.</p><p>Let us know your thoughts. Post in the comments below, email <a href=""mailto:email:karl.mathiesen.freelance@theguardian.com"">karl.mathiesen.freelance@theguardian.com</a> or tweet <a href=""https://twitter.com/KarlMathiesen"">@karlmathiesen</a></p>",1211,"The EU’s de facto ban on genetically modified (GM) crops may have caused more harm than good, according to the UK’s chief scientist. Sir Mark Walport told MPs on the Science and Technology committee on Wednesday: “The consequence of inactions are that we are potentially, particularly in Europe, denying access to technologies that actually will potentially help feed people in ways that damage the environment less.” He said food security in Europe, particularly in Britain, was more tenuous than people realised and the costs of controlling agricultural pests could be significantly reduced. Only one GM crop is currently grown commercially in the European Union – the insect-resistant maize MON 810. Gaining approval for the cultivation of GM crops in the EU has been effectively impossible because each one requires a vote by member states. Many EU countries are sceptical of the technology. So even if a crop is approved by the European Food Safety Authority (Efsa) it is unlikely to make it into commercial fields. New rules allowing member states to unilaterally ban GM may ease this political blockade. Scientists, including Walport and the EU chief scientist Anne Glover whose role is being axed, say GM is not inherently dangerous, essentially no different to the selective breeding that humans have engaged in for millennia and each crop should be assessed on its own merits. “It makes more sense to assess crops based on their individual characteristics and the farming practices that accompany them, rather than the method by which they were produced,” says Mark Downs, chief executive of the Society of Biology. Walport told the committee that the UK’s advocacy for GM crops in the face of EU opposition was scientifically justified. “I do consider that to be an evidence-based policy indeed. The science is very clear and I’m happy that the government have taken on board the science.” Wendy Harwood, a senior scientist at the John Innes Centre, said GM’s commercial stasis meant useful technologies were being ignored. “As scientists we see promising things coming along and there’s a frustration that these things will never actually benefit people because of the huge costs.” A study published in the journal PLOS One this year found “on average, GM technology adoption has reduced chemical pesticide use by 37%, increased crop yields by 22%, and increased farmer profits by 68%”. Jonathan Jones, a plant molecular biologist at the Sainsbury Laboratory, says the tales of missed opportunity are legion because the regulatory requirements for GM crops are “far in excess of what’s rational”. The cost of the process, hundreds of millions of pounds, means very few crops are worth the risk of bringing all the way through. This cost excludes the public sector from developing commercial crops, leaving the sector oligopolised by a handful of massive agro-corporations. But in Europe, even these well-resourced companies are turning away from the technology. A strain of blight-resistant potatoes was removed from the approval process by agrochemical giant BASF after it became clear that even if it was found to be safe by Efsa, it was likely be voted down by EU politicians. Jones says the GM potato could have saved millions. Blight costs UK potato farmers around £60m every year in losses and the massive use of chemical sprays. Each hectare has £500 worth of fungicide dumped on it each season. Jones says there are similar stories for pest-resistant cabbages and broccoli as well as yellow-rust resistant wheat. “These are examples where in a rational world we’d be just getting on with [them].” Joe Perry, chair of Efsa’s GMO Panel, disagrees with Jones’ assertion that the regulatory burden is too great. “He’s wrong. The risk assessment is quite rational and is not much different to any other regulatory authority.” He says “the data requested are proportionate to the risk” and that each technology must be approached as novel and without assumption. “Just because we haven’t seen any problems in the past, doesn’t mean we are not going to see problems in the future.” Efsa has not found any GM crops to pose a serious risk to human or animal health. But Perry says the cultivation of GM crops does raise legitimate environmental concerns. For example, the cultivation of MON 810 maize, which produces a protein that harms the insects that eat it, could create a super pest strain with resistance to natural plant defences. But Perry says most of these concerns can be ameliorated by management, rather than a ban. For example, controlling how much MON 810 is planted in one area. It is Efsa’s job to assess the danger posed by GM crops to humans and animals as well as the environment. The EU, under the precautionary principle, has an obligation to also assess the benefits and then make an informed decision weighing the two against each other. But Perry says the EU has neglected to define the benefits, skewing the bloc’s policy. Walport joined Jones by suggesting the GM debate is a conflict between objective science and irrational belief. “We pretend that the debate about genetically modified crops is a debate about science when the reality is actually that the science is very clear. It is really a debate about values. About people [with] strongly held personal opinions and beliefs [who] believe that there is something wrong in humans modifying nature.” Defining the GM debate as a contest between objective science and irrational belief allows scientists to ignore a wider definition of risk and to frame opponents as fundamentalists. But Marco Contiero, Greenpeace’s EU policy director on agriculture says many of the scare tactics used against GM – for example the moniker “Frankenfoods” – are red herrings. He says GM technology is “absolutely brilliant” in highly controlled circumstances, but says there are serious, rational, empirical questions about the reality of GM cultivation in the wider environment. The benefits attributed to GM can only be seen as benefits if you accept a form of agriculture dominated by five monolithic corporations and vast fields of single crops with a massive ecological footprint, he says. “GM crops can benefit, from an economic point of view, large scale farmers who enjoy economies of scale which allow them to recover the higher costs of GM seeds and the agro-chemicals that come with them in packages, for example Monsanto GM crops tolerant to herbicide RoundUp and Monsanto RoundUp herbicide. “However, it is imperative to achieve a paradigm shift from such kind of farming, which damages the environment in many different ways at local (e.g. agrochemical pollution) as well as international level (fostering climate change due to its reliance on fossil fuels) towards farming systems based on agricultural diversity and biodiversity.” The GM story conversation breaks down because of these differing frames of reference. Opponents refuse to acknowledge the potential and proven benefits of crops that resist pests or drought or have higher concentrations of important nutrients. To do so would undermine their position on agricultural reform. Scientists are caught uncomfortably between the potential of a technology that is inherently useful and the reality of an agricultural system dominated by corporations with a track record of environmental vandalism. By defining the costs and benefits within certain parameters, Walport ignores vital questions about how we farm, who owns the means of production and who ultimately benefits.",,0.09252325613976099

A quick trip across the island disabuses any real worry that strip malls and box stores are imminent, but a certain measure of change is definitely on the way. There’s something in the air – a bit more free expression, a glimmer of innovation, a softer hand, maybe. At customs, there is still a kind of unblinking assumption of superiority that is the hallmark of a still-authoritarian state. I am detained for an hour of rigorous questioning, during which I explain that I have been invited to give the first TED talk in the history of Cuba. The customs agent asks who Ted is. Yes, it is a name, I answered, but, no, I don’t work for him. Arriving at my hotel, a former textile building in Old Havana itself torn between history and modernity, the duality of it all reminds me of F Scott Fitzgerald’s maxim that an advanced intellect must be able to “hold two conflicting ideas in one’s mind at the same time”. Modern Cuba is a society that invites a visitor to spend the morning exploring grand political notions of past and future and then – due to isolation from the digital world, imposed as much from within as without – to spend most of an afternoon just waiting for a search of “F Scott Fitzgerald” to load. So much for McDonald’s. Good luck, Facebook. On the flight down, before going off grid, I’d read the New York Times’ latest editorial in a series on “Washington’s failed policies toward Cuba”, which has included a call to an end of the 54-year US embargo. It’s time to wind down cloak-and-dagger efforts to undermine the Cuban regime and try a new approach, the pundits now suggest, presumably as incentive for the Cuban government to loosen its grip on its people. There’s a paternalism to the western coverage, an assumption that Castro is stunting the growth of his locked-in people, blocking their capacity to enter the 21st century. Yet here in Old Havana, I watch the city wake like a mammoth shaking off a long slumber. The embargo may have mothballed Cuba in a state of arrested development for decades, but the end of the Cold War and Cuba’s subsequent abandonment by her Soviet patron sent a kind of double shockwave through the Cuban people and their leaders. Everywhere you look, there are signs of homespun innovation, of the defiant brand of resilience that Cubans have shown repeatedly over a long history of oppression: Take away our fuel supply and, yes, we will go back to buggy whips and gallop past you in your rent-a-car on our pothole-riddled roads. Across the street from my hotel, the shopkeeper of a brand-new artisanal cheese shop hangs out his hand-scrawled shingle, opposite a new health food store offering kosher and GMO-free provisions. A block further sits the Museum of Chocolate, joining the avant-garde of luxury chocolatiers that seem the hallmark of every bustling metropolis these days. These shops are evidence as much of a kind of mom-and-pop entrepreneurship as of a measured transformation in a government’s recognition of its people’s innate free-market yearning. A block further sits what locals call “Beverly Hills”, an idyllic town square that seems a million miles from the rest of Havana: a gentrified bubble that’s home to the first signs of Western capitalist franchising. There’s a Benetton store, a Pepe Jeans, a micro-brewery and, most recently, the clothier Paul &amp; Shark. Between the proliferation of smaller-scale shops and the handful of expat chain stores, you see a wide spectrum of emerging entrepreneurship. In a sense, of course, it’s all more appearance than reality: the shops are all owned by the government, and the shopkeepers pay a lion’s share of their profit to the state. Still, in the proud smile of the cheesemonger, you see GUM-style Soviet retail giving way to the first cautious steps in the Cuban government’s experimentation with a looser grip. Suddenly, an emergency catapults me into a brush with Cuban socialism, as a member of my traveling party has fallen suddenly ill. A rickshaw driver named Reinier navigates us to a clinic where, within minutes, a team of caring doctors has given a thorough exam and provided antibiotics. At the cashier, a bill: $45 for a one-hour consultation and $20 for the antibiotics. How’s that for a pragmatic midpoint between capitalism and socialism? Note to self: remember Fitzgerald. Taken together, a morning’s inspired glimpse at Cuba’s growing small business sector and the afternoon’s experience with the strength of its safety net combine to put the Times’ now-or-never, all-or-nothing approach to American interventionism in stark relief. Cuba, left to her own devices, is confronting the same conflicting forces the whole world faces – namely, how to balance economic expansion while maintaining social values, how to preserve a local culture while welcoming the global effect of capitalism, and how to avoid the dangers of wealth inequality that too often attend development. But Havana is humming with possibility. Rather than get its hands messy in yet another ill-advised misadventure, the US government or any other outside player might better trust that, in the absence of the distorting forces of the Cold War, Cuba is plenty capable on its own to follow Fitzgerald’s maxim as it navigates into tomorrow, with or without decent WiFi.",,0.11830986229134377

Writing on his website, Young accused Starbucks of “hiding behind” an organisation called the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA), which, along with three other food companies, is jointly suing the state of Vermont over a new law requiring genetically modified ingredients to be labelled on food products. Although Starbucks is one of the GMA’s many member companies, the corporation is not itself part of the court proceedings. “I used to line up and get my latte everyday, but yesterday was my last one,” Young said. “Starbucks doesn’t think you have the right to know what’s in your coffee ... [It] is supporting a lawsuit that’s aiming to block a landmark law that requires genetically modified ingredients be labelled. Amazingly, it claims that the law is an assault on corporations’ right to free speech.” In a statement, Starbucks denied playing any part in the Vermont legal battle and contended that it has yet to take “a position on the issue of GMO labelling”. The company “is not a part of any lawsuit pertaining to GMO labelling nor have we provided funding for any campaign”, the statement continues. “Starbucks is not aligned with [GMO maker] Monsanto to stop food labelling or block Vermont state law.” Nevertheless, Starbucks did not condemn the GMA’s move. In fact, a representative of the company said of Vermont’s Act 120: “As a company with stores and a product presence in every state, we prefer a national solution [to GMO labelling]”, rather than state-by-state rules. Still, Young shows no sign of getting back into a queue for his caramel macchiato. As the singer releases Storytone, his 35th studio album, the open letter remains prominent on his website: “Considering that Starbucks has been progressive on LGBT and labour issues in the past, it’s disappointing that it is working with the biggest villain of them all, Monsanto,” he wrote. “Monsanto might not care what we think – but as a public-facing company, Starbucks does.” In recent years, Young has been commenting on political issues with increasing regularity. He has attacked the automotive industry, lobbied against fracking, and raised money for a Native Canadian group’s legal fight with oil companies. His new record also includes the song Who’s Gonna Stand Up? (And Save the Earth), which he has offered free to climate change activists. Storytone debuted at No 20 on the UK’s Official Albums Chart.",,0.09711270871985157

The $25m three-year experiment will involve scientists testing thousands of rats which will be fed differing diets of a Monsanto GM maize and the world’s most widely-used herbicide which it it is engineered to be grown with. The organisers of the Factor GMO [genetically modified organism] study, announced in London on Tuesday and due to start fully next year, say it will investigate the long-term health effects of a diet of a GM maize developed by US seed and chemical company Monsanto. “It will answer the question: is this GM food, and associated pesticide, safe for human health?” said Elena Sharoykina, a campaigner and co-founder of the Russian national association for genetic safety (Nags), the co-ordinator of the experiment. According to the Nags, the experiment will try to establish whether the GM maize and its associated herbicide cause cancers, reduce fertility or cause birth defects. The scientists also want to know whether the mixture of chemicals present in Roundup (Monsanto’s tradename for its glyphosate herbicide) are more or less toxic than its active ingredient glyphosate. Farmers, governments, scientists and consumers around the world have been involved in an intense debate since GM foods were introduced in 1994. But while there have been many thousands of studies conducted, mostly by GM companies, which show that there is no health risk, government regulators have not required evidence of long-term safety and deep mistrust has built between different “sides”. “We would clearly support well-conducted, hypothesis-driven science. If the science is conducted according to OECD guidelines and shows that there are hazards with a particular event, then the public will understand that,” said Prof Huw Jones, senior research scientist at Rothamsted Research, which specialises in agricultural research and is the only research institute in the UK currently carrying out a GM crop trial. Oxana Sinitsyna, deputy science director at the Sysin research institute of human ecology and environmental health which is part of the Russian ministry of health, one of the three scientists on the Factor GMO study’s review board, said: “The scale and format of this research project will allow us to create a really objective and comprehensive data set on the mechanics of the impacts of a GM diet on the health of living organisms over the long term. “From a scientific point of view the ‘Factor GMO’ project is highly ambitious, which makes it very interesting, for both the public and for the scientists involved.” Bruce Blumberg, another board member, who is a biology professor at the University of California, Irvine, said: “The cultivation of herbicide resistant crops is widespread in the US, and the use of the herbicides to which these crops are resistant has increased many-fold in the decades since they were introduced. There is a notable lack of published, peer-reviewed data on their safety, as well as data on the safety of the increased use of herbicides with which they are grown.” The planned study will have no input from the biotech industry or the anti-GM movement, said Sharoykina.“Comprehensive scientific safety studies on GMOs and their related pesticides are long overdue. All previous studies caused controversy for various reasons: choice of animal, insufficient statistics, duration of tests, research parameters, and researchers’ connections to the anti-GMO movement or the biotech industry. “This study is intended to remedy the situation. The project organisers have considered all of the points of disagreement and distrust surrounding this subject.” She added that Nags would not have any involvement in the scientific process. Most of the $25m has been raised, say the organisers, but the names of sponsors and funders will not be revealed until the experiment starts fully next year. Fiorella Belpoggi, a cancer specialist with the Ramazzini insistute in Italy and a board member of the study said: “This is not at all an anti-GM study. We are being neutral. We don’t know if it’s good or bad. Maybe in the future I will be a cheerleader with Monsanto. But I want science to find out”. The experiment, which will be conducted in western Europe and Russia, was cautiously welcomed by both GM sceptics and proponents of the technology. However, Monsanto did not respond to invitations for an interview. Karl Haro von Mogel, a public research geneticist in Madison, said on the Biofortified website: “If they conduct the study and publish it in the peer-reviewed literature, it can make a contribution to the existing literature. They frame the need for this study by saying that ‘there has never been a scientific study that is comprehensive enough to give them a clear answer regarding the safety for human health of any one GM food – until now’. The study has not been done yet, so this is putting the cart before the horse.” Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said: “There is still scientific uncertainty regarding what effects GM crops could have on the environment and the health of consumers, especially in the long term. If this is a well-designed, transparent and accountable study, then hopefully it can help to fill some of the major gaps in our knowledge of the impacts of GM glyphosate resistant maize and glyphosate on health.” Peter Melchett, policy director with the Soil Association, said: “I welcome this. It has been a scientific fraud that no scientific study like this has been done in the past.” Monsanto was contacted for a response but did not reply. In the past it has claimed that trillions of meals have been eaten by consumers without ill effects. The announcement of the experiment came as British anti-GM campaigners delivered a letter to Downing street signed by US environment groups representing over 50m people, as well as celebrities including Susan Sarandon, Daryl Hannah and Robert Kennedy. The letter warns Britain that the intensive growing of GM crops has caused major environmental problems in the US. “GM crops have never delivered on their promises to increase yields and profits or to decrease pesticide use. In fact, they have done the opposite with the cost of growing GM crops now greater than conventional crops in the US and pesticide use 24% higher amongst GM farmers than non-GM farmers planting the same crops”, says the letter which was delivered by former Labour environment minister Michael Meacher and Tory MP Zac Goldsmith. Separately on Tuesday, MEPs voted to allow national bans on GM food crops for environmental reasons.",,0.08508977361436376
102,article,sustainable-business/2014/nov/04/gmo-labeling-vote-colorado-oregon-ballot,Guardian Sustainable Business,2014-11-04,GMO labeling is put to a close vote in another series of states,https://gu.com/p/4323b,,GMO labeling is put to a close vote in another series of states,"<p>With GMO labeling on many state ballots, food companies have pumped money into massive ad campaigns across the country. Pro-labeling groups face an uphill battle on Tuesday</p>",994,"Food policy wonks will spend Tuesday keeping a close eye on the outcome of ballot initiatives in Colorado and Oregon that would require food products that contain genetically-modified ingredients to carry a label. It’s a food fight we’ve seen before, and one that is again prompting the nation’s largest food and agriculture companies to pour millions in funding to defeat the measures. The fiercer of the two fights is playing out in Oregon. Opponents of Oregon’s Ballot Measure 92, requiring labeling of genetically engineered food, have raised nearly $19m. There are no surprises on the donor list: Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, General Mills, Kraft, Kellogg’s, ConAgra and other large food companies who rely on genetically engineered crops like corn, soybean and sugar beet for their products; as well as Monsanto, DuPont Pioneer and Dow AgroSciences who develop and sell the genetically engineered seeds and pesticides, and maintain the technology is safe. The companies also funded efforts to defeat California’s Proposition 37 in 2012; and Washington’s initiative 522 in 2013. Labeling supporters in Oregon have secured less than half of that – just $7.6m – so far, but a recent SurveyUSA poll shows the race remains tight, with 44% of Oregon voters in support of the measure; 43% opposing, and 13% undecided. Other polls show the no side pulling ahead. It has become costliest ballot measure in Oregon’s history. Despite the massive corporate spending, Rebecca Spector, west-coast director for the Center for Food Safety, which supports and tracks state-by-state labeling efforts, says momentum and strategy have helped maintain support for the Oregon initiative. “Unlike Colorado, the Oregon initiative got started earlier because it went through the legislature, where it failed, but then went directly to the ballot. So the people in Oregon have had a longer time to secure funding,” she says. “There’s only a limited amount of resources, and the decision [by those on the yes side] was made to put the funds into Oregon.” That’s kept the race closely matched when it comes to TV airtime and the near 10,000 ads saturating regional viewers. In Colorado, the disparity in funding means labeling supporters are bracing for a loss. The No on 105 Coalition has pulled in over $16.6m from companies including DuPont Pioneer, Monsanto, Coca-Cola, Land O’Lakes and Bimbo Bakeries, whose brands include Thomas’, Sara Lee and Entenmann’s. Of that, $4.3m has been spent running more than 3,300 television ads. In comparison, those in favor of food labeling have raised less than $1m, and have not aired a single television ad. “That’s the strategy – bury it in money,” says Chris Arnold, spokesperson for Denver-based Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. “This appears to be shaping up the way these things have in other states where the initiative gets enough signatures to get on the ballot. Initial polling is very much in favor, and it gets buried in money from big agriculture and big food, and in most cases that’s enough to defeat it.” Chipotle began disclosing menu items that contained genetically engineered ingredients to customers in 2013, and expects to eliminate remaining GMO ingredients from the menu in the coming months. While it’s publicly endorsed labeling initiatives in both Colorado and Oregon, the company has stopped short of contributing financial support to the issue. “We don’t contribute as a matter of policy,” says Arnold. Meanwhile the flush of funding to defeat Colorado’s Proposition 105 appears to be working. Polling numbers in July showed 75% of registered Colorado voters were in favor of the measure. As of last week, support has dwindled to 34%. “It’s a frustrating cycle to see repeating, but someone will crack this nut. You don’t need to see them pass in a huge number of states before it becomes more efficient to have a single national standard regulating GMOs,” says Arnold. GMO-labeling laws have been passed in Connecticut and Maine, but both included trigger clauses that require neighboring states to pass similar laws before taking effect. Neither of these states will be directly affected if Colorado or Oregon change their laws, but they will be watching for a domino effect. In May, Vermont became the first state in the nation to pass a GMO labeling law without that requirement. It is scheduled to take effect in June 2016, but is being challenged by a federal lawsuit filed by the Grocery Manufacturers Association who did not respond to the Guardian interview request. As the labeling fight matures, both sides are now looking toward federal legislation. “General Mills has long opposed state-based labeling laws. We believe food-labeling regulations should be set at the national level, not state-by-state – and we oppose the two state-based labeling initiatives before voters this November in Oregon (Measure 92) and Colorado (Proposition 105),” says General Mills spokesperson Kirstie Foster in an email. The conversation at the national level is just as divided. Proponents hope to see passage of the Genetically Engineered Right to Know Act introduced in 2013 by US senator Barbara Boxer (D-California) and congressman Peter DeFazio (D-Oregon). Large food and agriculture companies support The Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2014 introduced by representative Mike Pompeo (R-Kansas). The bill would preempt state-led efforts to label genetically engineered ingredients and promote voluntary labeling. Spector predicts more bills will be introduced at the state level in 2015, and suspects we’ll see movement at the federal level. “In 2014, 36 GE-labeling bills were introduced in legislatures in 20 states. That shows there’s still huge momentum for these initiatives,” says Spector. “Until the federal government and the FDA require mandatory GE labeling, it’s important that these initiatives take place at the legislative level, where there are public hearings, and opportunity to amend the law.” Read more like this: From vegan beef to fishless filets: meat substitutes are on the rise Next-gen urban farms: 10 innovative projects from around the world The food hub is funded by The Irish Food Board.

Who will win?,https://gu.com/p/42jjq,Lifestyle,Ben and Jerry take on Monsanto and Hormel over genetically modified foods. Who will win?,<p>Measure that would force food producers to reveal if they are using genetically modified ingredients is attracting record campaign funds from huge corporations<br></p>,947,"The fight over labelling genetically modified (GMO) foods has created some strange bedfellows in Oregon. On Tuesday, Oregon voters will pass judgment on Measure 92, which would give the state power to force food producers to reveal that they are using genetically modified ingredients. Except this isn’t just a battle in Oregon; the state has become the focus of the national dispute over food labelling. That influx of national interest is why Measure 92 has broken the Oregon record for costliest ballot measure: total campaign funding now stands at $26.8m. Although Oregon’s vote is a local issue, 100% of the budget for the opposition campaign – and 80% of the funds in support – have come from outside of the state. Following the paper trail reveals some strange alliances. The Yes campaign has raised $7.8m, while opponents collected more than twice the amount, at $19m. The opposition campaign benefits from the deep pockets of its largest corporate contributor, the multinational agribusiness company Monsanto, which made $4.7m in donations to the No camp. It is also getting a big boost from Hormel foods, the multibillion-dollar owner of brands such as Spam and Skippy, which has gifted $95,000. Countering Monsanto is California-based staple of health-food stores Dr Bronner’s Magic Soap, which has pumped in $1.7m in support of GMO labelling. Last year, Dr Bronners’ “activism director” Adam Eidinger walked into the Senate building in Washington DC and rained money down the atrium (a shower of 2,000 $1 bills they called “Monsanto money”). And countering Hormel? Hormel scion Tom Hormel, an artist and photographer who has taken a stance against the old family business by donating $500,000 to the Yes camp. He has stated in interviews that he and his brothers were cut off from the family business after the death of their father Jay Hormel. “It’s a monster of a threat that people have no concept of,” Hormel told the Oregonian about his support for GMO labelling. “I want there to be a clear picture of the risks and I don’t see any. No one is talking about that.” If Oregon passes the measure, it would be the second. Only Vermont successfully passed mandatory GMO labelling. It’s not that other states haven’t tried. Oregon’s Measure 92 comes close on the heels of similar unsuccessful high-budget campaigns in Washington and California. Ice-cream maker Ben and Jerry’s fought for the labeling in its home state earlier this year with a specially themed “Food Fight Fudge Brownie” flavour and is now supporting the campaign in Oregon, imploring its fans to vote Yes. To understand the fight over Measure 92 better, we talked to Ivan Maluski, who runs a family-owned farm in Linn County, Oregon. He is the policy director of Friends of Family Farmers, an Oregon association of independent farmers. He says Oregon’s farmers principally support Measure 92 because it benefits local formers over large corporations. Below is our conversation with Maluski, edited for space and clarity. Why are Oregon’s farmers supporting Measure 92? It’s important to know that the vast majority of Oregon farmers do not grow GE [genetically engineered] food crops. For example, nobody grows soy or cotton here. We have a ban on canola in one of our biggest agricultural producing regions because it threatens our specialist seed industry. There are some GE crops grown here but they are typically not intended for consumption and they’re not our biggest crops. We farmers here have tended to benefit from consumers wanting to know where the food comes from and whether it’s genetically engineered. Hiding information tends to not help us. It tends to benefit out-of-state processed foods more than Oregon farmers. But won’t special labeling increase costs to Oregon’s consumers? Food companies change their labels all the time. That cost is non-existent. There’s nothing in this measure that says the companies have to change what’s in the food. All this measure does is tell you you have to accurately say it on the food. At the end of the day, the costs will be nothing or at most very minimal. Like a couple of dollars a year for consumers. What do you think is the future of GMO labeling as a political issue in the US? The federal government has failed to do its job in providing oversight over genetically engineered crops and food in a way that protects farmers and consumers. The FDA, for example, has been sitting on draft of non-binding voluntary labeling guidelines since 2001. Congress cannot seem to legislate its way out of a paper bag, so there’s no realistic hope that Washington DC will address these issues. That’s why we support the rights of local communities including states to be able to lead the way. We think that this initiative is very reasonable. It protects farmers from losses. It’s very consistent with labelling requirements that are in place in other locations around the world. If you were to ever go to a national labelling standard in the US, we think this Oregon measure could be a model to build that on. If enough states act, the federal government may finally lead in the right direction as well. What would you say to scientific opposition that GMO foods are not very different from other foods? I don’t think there is any good scientific argument against labelling. It’s more of a market economics issue and a truth-in-advertising question. Perhaps some oppose the stigma. I’m not sure why just stating whether something is genetically modified or not is a stigma. Putting a label on, as being proposed by Measure 92, is not in conflict with other labels we have for foods whether it’s juice “from concentrate” or “country of origin”.",,0.11575396825396828

A few life lessons in how to react when Intel, Coca-Cola or other giants take an interest<br></p>",1212,"When General Mills announced plans to buy Annie’s, the maker of rabbit-shaped mac and cheese, howls of protest were felt quicker than a toddler without his favorite carbs. How could Annie’s, a company known for its opposition to genetically modified foods, sell to a giant food conglomerate that says GMO foods are not just harmless, but smart? True, “The General” agreed to let Annie’s maintain its non-GMO stance. And the selling price of $820m didn’t hurt. But Annie’s is the just latest example of a beloved startup that chooses to sell itself to a big company. You can say it began when Ben and Jerry’s was bought by Unilever. Like General Mills, Unilever is on record as opposing letting consumers know when it’s using GMO foods. Ben &amp; Jerry’s, in contrast, is on the opposite side: it in the process of transforming its flavors to non-genetically modified ingredients and created a new flavor, Food Fight, to raise money to support a Vermont law on GMO labelling. Cult brands get sold. But what happens in the process is instructive for every small business owner and entrepreneur who has considered giving up control to ensure his or her company grows. Iams pet food was bought by Procter and Gamble. Tom’s toothpaste is now part of Colgate-Palmolive. Honest Tea became a wholly owned subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Company. Most recently, Tom’s, the company that donates a pair of shoes to a needy child for every pair it sells, agreed to sell half of itself to private-equity firm Bain Capital (of Mitt Romney fame) to fund an expansion of its operations in the US and overseas. And both parents are wise enough to leave the kids alone. Some entrepreneurs believe a company is forever. Others see it this way: selling your company one day is the whole point. Making friends early “When you start a company, you’re building it for success and for acquisition partners to come to you,” says Nadeem Kassam, who sold his start-up Basis Science to tech giant Intel. Kassam, a former entertainment industry executive, started his company in 2004, but didn’t come to Silicon Valley until 2010. As he was raising money from venture capitalists for Basis, he realized he would have to prove his credibility. His co-founder was a techie, so that went some way to allaying the fears of the VCs. “I had a record of success in the entertainment industry but not in Silicon Valley, so it was an uphill battle to sell myself and the product,” Kassam says. He persevered in that early experience not just to get the funding, because he wanted the company to attract the attention of influential potential buyers early. “Ideally, by building a company that captures market share, you will turn the eyes and ears of some of the big boys,” Kassam says. “The investors you have in your company are critical for your future success,” Kassam says. The plan worked. “Intel came to the company in the B round and that is when firms like Google, Samsung and Apple began to take notice. And that is when Intel began to consider taking us in-house.” The course of mergers and acquisitions never did run smooth, however. Food brands, unlike tech ones, establish close relationships with consumers, and a merger can feel like a betrayal to loyalists. Honest Tea, a beloved maker of iced tea drinks, felt the wrath of customers when the company sold itself to Coca-Cola. In 2008, Goldman and Nalebuff sold 40% of the company to Coca-Cola for $43m. In 2011, they sold the remainder of the company to Coca-Cola for an undisclosed amount. The Organic Consumers Association called for a boycott of Honest Tea and all Coca-Cola products, “because Honest Tea’s parent company, Coca-Cola, spent $3.2m to defeat GMO labeling initiatives in California and Washington state.” “People put our product in their bodies. So the consumer does connect on an emotional level to food brands. Any time an entrepreneurial brand becomes part of a large company, you will have points where they two parties are not going to see eye to eye,” says Seth Goldman, the “TeaEO” of Honest Tea. “I have a response I give to people that explains our position on issues and more often than not, the customer who thinks for himself or herself will listen to your side,” said Goldman. “They might still boycott your product but at least they listened.” Authenticity and bootstrapping is a creation story that’s important to many customers. Honest Tea had that. Goldman co-founded in 1998 with Barry Nalebuff, his professor at the Yale School of Management. Goldman quit his job at Calvert Investments, and started brewing batches of tea in his kitchen. Neither he nor Nalebuff had experience in running a business, but raised $500,000 from their families. “We put our own money in and both of our parents did as well; and received money from people who would invite back for Thanksgiving; even if we lost their money,” said Goldman. He then brought thermoses of tea and a recycled bottle with a mock-up label to Fresh Fields, which is owned by Whole Foods. Fresh Fields ordered 15,000 bottles. By 2007, Honest Tea had become the best-selling “natural foods” tea and it was approached by large, multi-national food and beverage companies who were interested in buying the firm or making strategic investments. By then, Honest Tea had become the best-selling tea in the natural foods channel. Grocery chains and other distribution channels were interested in the product and the company needed a distribution solution. Goldman felt Coca-Cola, a minority investor for three years, was the way to get there. The investment gave the two companies time to get acquainted. He believes the sales numbers vindicate him. “Coke invested in us due to the equity we had in the natural foods market place. In our first 10 years, we sold 112 million bottles. In the subsequent six years since the Coca-Cola investment, we have sold 888 million bottles.” ‘Companies are bought, not sold’ Earlier this year, Chicago entrepreneur Brad Flora sold his latest venture, Perfect Audience, to Marin Software for $23m. “We weren’t looking to sell the company. Companies are bought, not sold,” he says. Marin approached him about an acquisition in November 2013. Flora said he was open to it “but not seeking it out expressly.” By February 2014, the company was evaluating several offers. Even with the early approach from Marin, talks were complicated. “Marin made several offers before there was one that made sense given our growth and other options. That process took months of discussions and was very difficult,” Flora says. What settled it: the acquirer promised to be a good steward of the company Flora built. “In the end, Marin made us an offer we just couldn’t refuse in terms of bringing our product and business to a much wider audience and making an offer that reflected the work we’d done,” he says. Kassam says he chose Intel in part for the same reason: “We were approached by numerous firms but Intel kept the team and offices intact.” “The entrepreneur has a dilemma when selling to a larger company,“ said Kassam. “If you see you are reaching a certain stage, it would be responsible to sell.”",,0.19427402099815896

In Colorado, Dupont and Monsanto food companies are outspending supporters of mandatory labelling by 22-1 ahead of the 4 November vote, according to state campaign finance records. In Oregon, meanwhile, industry is outspending supporters of the ballot measure by about 2-1. The heavy industry spending resembles the last-minute infusions of cash for television ads, direct mail, and campaign staff that helped defeat earlier campaigns for mandatory GM labelling in California and Washington state. “It is like David vs Goliath,” Larry Cooper, director of Colorado’s Right to Know campaign said. He said the pro-labelling campaign had raised $625,000 by Thursday afternoon. Cooper’s opponents, meanwhile, amassed $14m, after Dupont this week gave an additional $3m to the campaign, and were advertising heavily on local television. “Why they put $14m in Colorado to keep us in the dark really doesn’t make sense to me,” Cooper said. “The bottom line is that we really don’t know what is in our food. We are shopping blindly.” Monsanto alone has spent $4.7m to defeat the measure. Other top donors to the campaign to defeat pro-labelling Proposition 105 read like a grocery shopping list. They include: Pepsico, Kraft Foods, General Mills, Hershey Company, Coca-Cola and Kellogg, and Flower Food, according to Colorado state campaign finance records. The spending is much less lopsided in Oregon where opponents of the state’s Measure 92 labelling initiative have raised $11m while supporters have $6m. Monsanto is a major force in both states. “We oppose state-by-state mandatory labelling laws like Measure 92 in Oregon and Proposition 105 in Colorado,” a company spokeswoman said in an email. “The reason we don’t support them is simple. They don’t provide any safety or nutrition information and these measures will hurt, not help, consumers, taxpayers and businesses.” Unlike Colorado, labelling advocates in Oregon have attracted some big donors to their side, including $1m from Dr Bronners’ magic soaps. An heir to the Hormel meat-packing fortune. Thomas Hormel, who has no connection to the company and lives in Florida, gave $500,000, according to state campaign finance records. The company immediately ramped up its own donations, giving a total of $85,000 to defeat the labelling initiative. Kevin Glenn, a spokesman for Oregon Right to Know, said the pro-labelling side hoped to counter the financial advantage by grassroots organising. He said the campaign had opened five field offices in the state, and was about to start canvassing door-to-door. Organisers also had a bit of a head start. In May, voters in two rural counties voted to ban cultivation of GM crops, on the grounds that it put conventional produce at risk of contamination. Last year, a number of countries postponed wheat imports from Oregon after an outbreak of GM wheat from an experimental research station. Investigators have yet to discover the source of the GM outbreak, which occurred years after the tests were shut down. Scientists generally agree that foods containing GM ingredients are safe to eat, but the “right to know” has emerged as a hugely emotional issue for some Americans. Pro-labelling campaigners say the public has a right to know exactly what they are eating. Opponents say labels make no sense if there are no real health concerns, and risks stigmatising their products. Vermont earlier this year became the first US state to adopt mandatory labelling of GM foods – although the law does not go into effect until 2016. Maine and Connecticut have also passed GM labelling laws, but put them on hold.",,0.08628917378917378

This week, unnoticed by almost everyone, MEPs will consider proposals by the European commission and member states to overturn a ban on the cultivation of genetically modified (GM) crops in Europe. But it’s a step that could be undermined if anti-GM lobbyists get their way. This little-noticed debate could be crucial for the future of European agriculture. For nearly 15 years the European Union maintained a de-facto ban on any GM cultivation despite repeated advice from independent scientists that GM should be allowed to go ahead. This ban operated because certain countries, such as France and Hungary, have made it clear that they will never approve a GM crop under any circumstances, thereby preventing any other member state within the EU’s single market from allowing farmers to plant biotech seeds. No-one thinks that the French and Hungarians, who seem to have integrated anti-GM superstition into their cultural DNA, are going to change their minds anytime soon. So the proposals put in front of the European Parliament by the commission and member states (via the European council) were intended to allow anti-biotech countries to opt out of any pending GM crop approvals. The likes of France and Hungary would no longer have to advance their customary spurious scientific justifications: a religious-like aversion to new plant breeding technology will do just fine. This is a bitter pill to swallow if you think that science-based risk assessment should guide policymaking on important issues. But it is probably a necessary compromise in order to allow EU members like the UK, Spain and the Netherlands - who do want to move forwards on biotech research - to do so without being held back forever by the intransigents. Notably, these European council proposals won near-unanimous approval, from both anti and pro-GM countries in Europe, because they would allow each to make their own decisions. But this compromise, carefully crafted over four years of tortuous European Council negotiations, is now being undermined by anti-GM lobbyists working furiously behind the scenes in Brussels and Strasbourg. The latest proposals from the parliament’s influential environment committee have been so drastically amended that they would make the existing stalemate even worse. Specifically, the amendments the committee has put to fellow MEPs remove the requirement to first request a national opt-out before a country ban can be introduced. This upsets the careful compromise, where companies applying for permission to market GM seeds would be expected to agree to national opt-outs in order to avoid bans being formally introduced. The fear is that if anti-GM member states are allowed to go straight to the banning stage, this undermines the single market and would put unfair political pressure on those who want to allow GM cultivation. “If France has banned it,” the activists would shout, “it must be dangerous!” The amendments also further undermine the council’s proposals by suggesting opt-outs can be justified on safety grounds. In practice no seed developer will sign up to a statement that its product is unsafe, so countries would move straight to the national ban stage. These provisions appear intended by whoever drafted them behind the scenes to upset the proposed compromise and thereby keep the existing stalemate. This does make some kind of twisted sense: for the antis, of course, a de-facto ban is as good as a legally-agreed one, especially if it prevents any EU member state from moving forward. For the anti-GM campaigners, this is about keeping the EU blocked, preferably forever. Those pursuing this intransigent line will no doubt present themselves as the good guys, trying to stop the bad guys at Monsanto from enslaving European farmers. But that is a red herring. Monsanto has already publicly announced that it has given up on crop biotechnology in Europe. And in any case it should be farmers who decide which seeds they choose to grow, not city-based lobbyists working for NGOs. With private-sector crop biotech largely out of the picture, the activists are now trying to stamp out public-sector biotech in Europe as well. To the quiet despair of scientists at national academies, plant research institutes and universities across the continent, MEPs now risk sleepwalking into approving legislation which would effectively prohibit scientific research by default. The result would be that important taxpayer-funded biotech work could be frozen out of Europe on the back of a redundant anti-Monsanto trope. This matters because Europe is still, despite years of anti-biotech vandalism and pervasive misinformation, a leader in publicly-funded research to address some of the real challenges in agriculture. A consortium of European universities and public-sector research institutions has, for example, developed a blight-resistant potato, which could drastically reduce the need for chemical fungicides. Will European farmers ever be able to grow them? Not if MEPs rubber-stamp the latest proposals. Similarly, work by the UK-based Rothamsted Research on omega-3 oilseeds, aimed at developing a sustainable source of fish oils for salmon farmers, may never get beyond the laboratory. Instead, we will carry on hoovering up all the fish in the ocean to make fishmeal for feeding salmon – increasing the destruction of marine biodiversity, ironically in order to satisfy the entrenched ideologies of Greenpeace and its anti-biotech fellow travellers. There will be a chilling effect in developing countries too: in Bangladesh, anti-GMO campaigners are currently trying to stop poor farmers having access to aubergine seeds that eliminate the need for pesticides spraying. I have personally experienced how the antis, both in Asia and Africa, constantly cite European resistance to GMOs as proof of the validity of their cause and as justification for banning developing country farmers from accessing improved crops. The timeline is tight: the deadline for amendments to the European Parliament’s environment committee is Wednesday, with the new proposals set to be approved on 5 November. MEPs will no doubt be under intense pressure from NGO lobbyists to approve the amendments. Before doing so, they might consider consulting less politically powerful actors – in particular the scientific community whose work stands to be outlawed. Make no mistake: within three weeks from now crop biotech in Europe could be dead and buried. Europe’s cutting edge in an important field of scientific innovation will be lost forever. And our continent’s farmers will be stuck using gallons of pesticides and chemical fertilisers when science offers more environmentally-friendly ways of growing crops - if only European politicians will allow European farmers to use them. • Mark Lynas is an environmental writer and campaigner, and is currently visiting fellow at the College of Agriculture &amp; Life Sciences, Cornell University @mark_lynas",,0.051905964405964414
107,article,sustainable-business/2014/sep/29/social-licence-operate-shell-bp-business-leaders,Guardian Sustainable Business,2014-09-29,Business and society: defining the 'social licence',https://gu.com/p/42vyd,,Business and society: defining the 'social licence',"<p>From BP in the Gulf of Mexico to Shell in the Niger Delta, business, NGOs and politicians increasingly talk about social licence to operate. But what does it really mean?</p>",1040,"Business leaders, politicians and civil society set a common direction towards new global agreements on climate change at the UN climate conference in New York last week . Next year will also see a new set of global goals to meet the world’s most pressing development and sustainability problems. Direct involvement of the private sector is no longer debated. It is now a question of how much and some studies suggest that at least $1tn of private investment is needed. It remains unclear how these international public-private-partnerships (PPP) will be structured; the UN itself has no standard template. It is clearer that communities around the world will only accept such changes to the social contract if non-state actors are seen to be legitimate, not just in the eyes of elites but also by populations more generally. Inequality is increasing in most countries and the role of non-state actors themselves is increasingly questioned – for example in the form of demands for greater corporate accountability. When it comes to business, how should we understand whether companies have sufficient social legitimacy to take on joint responsibility for delivering essential goods: from health to clean drinking water, from ending gender discrimination to fighting corruption? Traditional approaches to corporate social responsibility (CSR) do not answer these questions sufficiently. Sir Geoffrey Chandler’s critiques of CSR formulated over ten years ago still stand. CSR is often too peripheral to the core business model, too much of a side-show, too far from providing real ‘shared value’ (as Porter and Kramer went on to argue). Even more fundamental are the false dichotomies that CSR has set up. There’s the voluntary versus mandatory debate, companies that are ‘good at CSR’ are valued regardless of the impact of their core operations, and the “self-declaratory” nature of much of CSR that Professor John Ruggie and others have challenged. If we are to be serious about international PPPs in relation to global sustainability goals, then we need to think more profoundly about how business relates to the pre-existing social contracts that bind societies and legitimise those that represent us at the international, national or local level. If defined in this way, the ‘social licence’ is a much more useful concept than CSR, as the social licence requires any business to ensure its activities respect the rights of all of those in any community. Social licence can never be self-awarded, it requires that an activity enjoys sufficient trust and legitimacy, and has the consent of those affected. Business cannot determine how much prevention or mitigation it should engage in to meet environmental or social risk – stakeholders and rights-holders have to be involved for thresholds of due diligence to be legitimate (sometimes even if these are clearly determined in law). There are many examples of where social license has been lost, from Shell in the Niger Delta, BP in the Gulf of Mexico, dam building in Myanmar to the GMO debate in Europe a generation ago. It is much harder to point at examples where the social license remains robust as the symptoms are far subtler – but there are examples of where activities have enjoyed strong social legitimacy. Between 2003 and 2007, Gap engaged in multi-stakeholder dialogue about how to reduce the risk of labour abuse in its supply chain, and was transparent about the mitigation measures it had taken. Its activities enjoyed some social licence. When child labour was alleged at an Indian supplier in 2007, the company was defended by a range of stakeholders for having undertaken a reasonable standard of due diligence. Social license does not allow companies to get away with child labour, quite the opposite. But when a company is setting new benchmarks on mitigation and transparency to lower the risk of child labour, it seems that sometimes trade unions and others are willing to say this publicly when something bad happens. Nor will stakeholders defend companies activities beyond a specific context. For example trade unions have expressed their disappointment in the position Gap has taken post the Rana Plaza disaster in Bangladesh. Another example is that of the Kenyan mobile phone operator, Safaricom, whose network – along with others – was inadvertently used to spread hate speech by including bulk text messages after the 2007 elections violence which led to over 1,000 deaths mainly in the Rift Valley. Safaricom worked hard in the period before the next election in 2012 to share the precautions it was taking to limit hate speech whilst protecting freedom of expression – including the involvement of third party observers. Safaricom built up strong social licence at a time of national transition and very significant social challenges. Whilst the social licence cannot be controlled directly by companies (that is part of its attraction) there are a number of factors that can be managed and these boil down to issues such as transparency, accountability, clarity about benefits, remedies and adequate due diligence. Consent is also an essential component. It is a mistake for any company to proceed on any activity without securing adequate social permissions. As we move towards final agreement on the 2015 UN Sustainability Goals, social licence is a concept that will re-occur because the social contract itself is being questioned. If PPPs do represent a new form of social contract, one in which business is part of the contract itself, then we need the accountability and governance tools to deal with this new reality or risk the backlash.

She asks you about the business plan. Straight-faced, you look back at her and smile. “We’re going to sell mismatched socks,” you say. “And all it will take is a $36,000 in startup cash.” Most of us would expect to be shown the door, but a new company – appropriately called Swap Socks – has convinced 205 investors that selling mismatched, color-coordinated socks is a fabulously cool idea. With a month left in its funding campaign at Indiegogo, the company has already surpassed its financing target. Turning an eyesore into an eye savior Swap Socks’ product is pretty straightforward: it sells four-packs of complimentary-colored socks, then encourages users to mix them up. Or, as they put it, “We happen to think keeping a tidy sock drawer is highly overrated ... sorry Mom!” But pairing odd socks is only part of the company’s attraction. The other part lies in its ultimate goal: contributing half its profits to battling preventable blindness around the world. “Our socks are designed to be distinctly mismatched, yet complementary,” Swap Socks says on its campaign page. “They serve as an eye-catching, wearable statement to show support for the movement to end preventable blindness. In the process, they spark natural conversation about the power and privilege of sight, which so many live without.” Match du Toit, one of the company’s founders, believes that Swap Socks’ success has a lot to do with the fact that it promises liberation from the tyranny of matched socks. “Having the freedom to mismatch your socks – for a good cause nonetheless – has really attracted people to Swap Socks,” du Toit says. “It’s a cool and fun way express oneself, while going against the common thread.“ Du Toit explains that his colleague Roger Nahum came up with the idea by combining two complimentary threads: his work with the socially conscious shoe company Teysha, and his experience with his visually impaired grandmother. Through research, Nahum found that approximately 80% of the 285m cases of impaired vision around the world can be cured or prevented with basic eye care. To that end, Swap Socks will be partnering with the Seva Foundation to help pay for everything from eye exams to eye surgery. Screaming for (real) ice cream Ever wondered why Häagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream tastes intense, rich and exotic, while some run-of-the-mill supermarket brands taste like fire extinguisher foam with pretensions? Part of the answer is simple: unlike many of its competitors, Häagen-Dazs uses real vanilla, instead of cheaper synthetic and artificial flavorings. As a front on the natural food war, ice cream is somewhat – well, vanilla. Recently, however, it became a battleground when Nestle and General Mills, who produce Häagen-Dazs, announced that the ice cream wasn’t going to use “synbio” vanilla, a flavoring that Evolva and International Flavors and Fragrances are attempting to market as “natural.” They produce it from “artificial DNA” and “genetically-engineered yeast.” “Häagen-Dazs and other leading ice cream companies have done the right thing by listening to the growing number of consumers who don’t want synbio vanilla and other extreme GMOs in their food and continuing to source vanilla produced by small farmers,” says Dana Perls, food and technology campaigner with Friends of the Earth. Perls claims that synthetic vanilla is just the beginning of a slew of lab-grown flavorings, many of which could undermine existing food producers. Next up could be carbon copies of saffron, stevia and coconut – all commodities produced by farmers around the world. “Unilever, Ecover and other companies using and investing in synbio ingredients must follow suit and give consumers what they want: transparency and responsible sourcing of truly natural, sustainable, non-GMO ingredients,” she says. A top-rat school Forget Harvard and Yale, Brown and Cornell. When it comes to bragging rights, one institute of higher learning clearly gnaws away at the competition: Rodent Academy. The New York City Rodent Control Academy – or NYCRCA, as it’s called by those in the know – offers either a half-day quick course or a three-day intensive program in “best practices” for “effectively managing rodent populations”. Using a combination of classroom instruction and field work (“bring a flashlight,” the website cautions), it covers topics ranging from pesticides to allergens to the preferred habitats of Norway rats. Lest you worry that the “better homes and burrows” aspect of the program is taught by rodent rookies, the program’s website promises that “the training is conducted by knowledgeable experts with practical field experience.” It’s a pretty sweet program, but if you still need something to seal the deal, there are the impressive rewards that come with graduation: “All participants will receive a rat management certificate, and a rat-resistant trash can,” the site states.

The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is being negotiated among European governments, the US and Canada, with the active participation of dozens of large businesses. It has already attracted strong criticism from democracy campaigners, who say it could mean the UK could have to open the National Health Service further to private companies, and complaints against large companies could be treated in secret without proper legal recourse. The potential impacts on food safety are less apparent as the negotiations are being conducted without public consultation. Progress on signing the partnership is expected to be hastened later this year when new EU commissioners are appointed. The European commission has strongly denied that the partnership would allow North American companies to circumvent EU food standards, particularly with regard to genetic modification. A spokesman for the commission told the Guardian: “TTIP will not change the way we regulate GMOs [genetically modified organisms] in Europe. EU trade commissioner Karel De Gucht stressed that publically many times. The EU has its red lines in the negotitations and the GMOs is one of them.” However, documents from various US and Canadian government agencies and business trade bodies suggest strong pressure is being brought to bear from US industries to allow GM products and other foods into EU markets that would violate the EU’s current standards, in the name of free trade. The US Department of Agriculture and Foreign Agricultural Service has explicitly identified “the EU’s non-tariff barriers to US agricultural products”, specifying in particular “long delays in reviews of biotech products [that] create barriers to US exports of grain and oil seed products”. The term biotech is generally used to refer to GM products. Lobbying from north American businesses has been intense. The North American Export Grain Association and National Grain and Feed Association have both called for the “reduction and elimination of measures related to crop biotechnology that currently restrict or prevent trade in grains, oilseeds and their derived food and feed products”. The American Soybean Association has also weighed in, saying: “TTIP must address the key EU biotech politices that are discriminating against US exports.” This includes removing the EU’s traceability and labelling policies for products containing biotech ingredients, under which they must be clearly labelled, in favour of a looser policy of labelling some foods “GMO-free”, even if this cannot be guaranteed to the same level as current standards require. “Inclusion of biotech ingredients should not be stigmatised with a label,” the organisation said. Mute Schimpf, food campaigner at Friends of the Earth in Brussels, told the Guardian that the EU had shown itself too willing to give in to such lobbying, despite protestations to the contrary, because in a new deal with Canada – outside of the TTIP but related to it – the two have agreed to have a “shared objective” of minimising the disruption to trade from their different GM rules. “Politicians have been trying to reassure citizens that public safeguards will not be traded away behind closed doors in free-trade deals with the US and Canada. It is therefore deeply alarming that evidence now emerging from a pact with Canada shows that Europe has willingly made an agreement that undermines its own safety regime for genetically modified foods. Citizens must demand that protecting public safety and the environment come before the profits of big business. Europe’s safety-first policies are a fundamental cornerstone and must not be traded away to please industry.” The European commission says that the EU would not be forced to allow imports of GM foods under the TTIP deal. “Will the EU be forced to change its laws on GMOs? No, it will not. Basic laws, like those relating to GMOs or which are there to protect human life and health, animal health and welfare, or environment and consumer interests will not be part of the negotiations,” according to a Q&amp;A on the EU’s website.",,0.03381877784051697
110,article,world/2014/aug/18/japanese-firms-encourage-workers-sleep-on-job,World news,2014-08-18,Japanese firms encourage their dozy workers to sleep on the job,https://gu.com/p/4vzex,News,Japanese firms encourage their dozy workers to sleep on the job,Poll finds that Japanese workers sleep for just six hours 22 minutes on work nights – less than those in any other country,494,"It's a daily struggle known to office workers the world over: a productive morning rewarded with a decent lunch, and then, at about 3pm, the leaden eyelids and urge to snatch 40 winks. In Japan, where workers get less sleep on work nights than those in other countries, more and more companies are encouraging employees to sleep on the job, convinced that it leads to better work performance. Okuta, a home renovation firm near Tokyo, allows its employees to take a 20-minute power nap at their desks or in the staff lounge. Introduced two years ago on the orders of the firm's chairman, Isamu Okuta, it has proved a huge hit. ""If I use a calculator when I'm sleepy, I have to double-check my work for fear of making mistakes, so it takes longer,"" Ikuko Yamada, who works in accounts, told the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper. ""I think my work performance has improved since I started taking naps."" Hugo Inc, an internet consulting company based in Osaka, has a more flexible approach: employees can take a 30-minute siesta any time between 1pm and 4pm. Japan's legions of salaried workers have more reason than most to give in to the urge for an afternoon nap. According to the US National Sleep Foundation's poll of sleeping habits around the world, Japanese workers sleep, on average, for just six hours 22 minutes on work nights – less than those in any other country. Not surprisingly, only 54% of Japanese respondents to the ""bedroom poll"" felt they got a good night's sleep every or almost every night. Only 8% managed more than eight hours. British workers get only 27 minutes more, at six hours 49 minutes, but Canadians, Mexicans and Germans all regularly achieve more than seven hours sleep, according to the poll. In Japan inemuri – or ""sleeping while present"" – is considered the preserve of employees exhausted by their commitment to hard work, rather than a sign of indolence. Exponents of inemuri, however, generally have to remain upright to avoid appearing slovenly. Japan's new approach is less about saving face than burying it in a plump pillow. The sanctioned siesta has spawned an industry in daytime sleep services. At Gmo Internet, an IT firm in Tokyo, employees have sofas to curl up on, while workers in the Umeda business district of Osaka can go off-site to a nearby public napping facility with beds. Tokyo's Ohirune Café Corne has eight beds for working women who want to sleep in partitioned comfort, soothed by the scent of essential oils. It charges 160 yen (93p) for every 10 minutes – and a pair of pyjamas for 100 yen – and clients stay for almost an hour on average, according to the Asahi Shimbun. Japan's growing tolerance for undisguised dozing during office hours comes after the government issued new guidelines on the importance of sleep, with the health ministry recommending that all working-age people take a nap of up to 30 minutes in the early afternoon.",,0.0914079822616408

A district judge in the state of Yucatán last month overturned a permit issued to Monsanto by Mexico’s agriculture ministry, Sagarpa, and environmental protection agency, Semarnat, in June 2012 that allowed commercial planting of Roundup-ready soybeans. The permit authorised Monsanto to plant its seeds in seven states, over more than 253,000 hectares (625,000 acres), despite protests from thousands of Mayan farmers and beekeepers, Greenpeace, the Mexican National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity, the National Commission of Natural Protected Areas and the National Institute of Ecology. In withdrawing the permit, the judge was convinced by the scientific evidence presented about the threats posed by GM soy crops to honey production in the Yucatán peninsula, which includes Campeche, Quintana Roo and Yucatán states. Co-existence between honey production and GM soybeans is not possible, the judge ruled. Mexico is the world’s six biggest producer and third largest exporter of honey. About 25,000 families on the Yucatán peninsula depend on honey production. This tropical region produces about 40% of the country’s honey, almost all of which is exported to the EU. This is not small change: in 2011, the EU imported $54m (£32m) worth of Mexican honey. The concerns are multiple. Roundup-ready crops – soybeans, corn, canola, sugar beets, cotton and alfalfa – have been manipulated to be resistant to glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup. Some argue that glyphosate poses a risk to human and animal health, a claim that Monsanto and other agribusinesses reject. In addition to health risks, environmental damage to soil, water and bee colonies – which are dwindling fast – have been attributed glyphosate use, threatening food and water security across the globe. GM crops could devastate the important European export market for Mexican beekeepers, where the sale of honey containing pollen derived from GM crops has been restricted since a landmark decision in 2011 by the European court of justice. The ruling barred honey derived from a GM crop unapproved for human consumption – which includes some soy and other animal feeds – from sale in the EU. Honey with more than 0.9% of GM pollen (from an approved GM food) must be labelled as containing GM ingredients and cannot be marketed as an organic product. Some countries, including Germany, reject honey that contains any GM pollen. A small study conducted in Campeche, where about 10,000 hectares of GM soybeans were planted after the permit was approved in 2012, found GM pollen in some honey samples destined for the European market. This, say the authors, threatens the local honey industry and contradicts the position taken by Sagarpa and industry groups that soybeans are not visited or pollinated by bees searching for food because they can self-pollinate. The Monsanto ruling was commended by the respected national newspaper La Jornada, which accused the Mexican government of ignoring widespread concerns over GM and forcing those opponents to fight it out in court with powerful multinational companies. The government’s stated ambition of eliminating hunger is incompatible with its decisions to increasingly allow multinational companies such as Monsanto to introduce GM crops, the paper’s editorial concluded. Central to the ruling was the Mexican constitution, specifically the government’s obligation to fully consult indigenous communities before making any major decision about what happens, including what is grown, on their territory. The judge ordered planting to stop and gave Sagarpa six months to carry out full and proper consultations with indigenous farmers – which it should have done before the permit was granted in 2012. It was this same omission that led to an almost identical ruling by a district judge in Campeche in March 2014. These two judgments have set a precedent that will help farmers, campaigners and environmentalists take local legal action against the rollout of GM soy and corn, which the federal government is sanctioning without consultation and against experts’ advice. But this is a high-stakes game to play, in which indigenous communities are being forced to fight their own government and multinational corporations with multimillion-dollar legal departments, simply to have their constitutional rights honoured and protect their traditional ways of farming and living. So while a third victory in Chiapas, where a similar case is pending, could soon follow, this is almost certainly only round one. Monsanto will probably appeal against the decision to a higher court. The North American Free Trade Agreement, criticised by some for crippling small-scale Mexican farming, is not on the side of the beekeepers. This David and Goliath battle is about so much more than honey.",,0.061188271604938275
112,article,sustainable-business/2014/aug/07/whole-foods-gmo-label-mandate-organic-raw-dairy-cheese-corn-grain-fed,Guardian Sustainable Business,2014-08-07,Quel fromage! Whole Foods' GMO labels make troubl for cheesemakers,https://gu.com/p/4vh76,,Quel fromage! Whole Foods' GMO labels make trouble for cheesemakers,"<p>For artisanal cheesemakers working with Whole Foods, the company’s GMO commitment sends ripples up the supply chain<br></p>",1458,"Walking with the tousled-haired Mateo Kehler is a practice in patience. It’s rare for him to travel two steps before he’s greeted by name, his hands are clasped, and he’s embraced by fellow cheesemakers, cheesemongers and buyers of his award-winning Jasper Hill cheeses. Among the nearly 1,000 attendees at the American Cheese Society’s annual conference in Sacramento last week, the name “Mateo” required no last name, no qualifier. In this world, he’s a mononymous superstar, a Bono or Beyonce. Kehler isn’t merely a leader in the American artisan cheese renaissance; he’s also knee-deep in the nation’s curdling fight over GMO labeling. He’s based in Vermont, the first state in the nation to pass a GMO labeling law. For now, the law excludes dairy products, pending a report by Attorney General Bill Sorrell due in January 2015. The dairy cows that Kehler depends upon to make cheeses like his bark-wrapped Harbison, buttery Alpha Tolman and gooey washed-rind Winnamere are not genetically modified. However, a small part of their feed comes from genetically engineered corn. For the moment, that’s not an issue in Kehler’s home state, but he says it’s a looming worry. The reason? Whole Foods, which last year became the first national chain to set a deadline – of 2018 – for full GMO transparency: “We heard our customers loud and clear asking us for GMO labeling and we are responding where we have control: in our own stores,” writes Walter Robb, co-CEO, in the company’s initial announcement. But the company is going beyond transparency and, in some categories, expressing a clear preference for GMO-free products. President and COO AC Gallo writes, “We are going beyond finished packaged products with a focus on meat, dairy, eggs and fish. To be labeled as non-GMO or organic, animals providing these products must be fed non-GMO or organic feed.” This focus on ingredients extends all the way up the supply chain. As Gallo explains, “Beer, wine and cheese will also need special consideration, since the use of genetically modified enzymes is fairly common when making these products.” As the largest specialty cheese retailer in the nation, Whole Foods’ decision casts a long shadow across the industry. For producers who want to continue selling their products there, the scramble to source non-GMO ingredients is heating up. The company’s standards are still developing, but by 2018, its producers will have to label products made from GMO ingredients – including dairy and meat products derived from livestock fed with genetically engineered crops. Kehler explains that this could be an insurmountable supply-chain problem. “There isn’t a large supply of non-GMO grain,” he says. “In Vermont, there’s one mill that supplies it and they’re not taking customers. We’re on a waiting list,” he says. A shrinking timeline For cheesemakers, whose products often require a year or more of careful aging, that timeline is becoming even more pressing. “You have to be verified [non-GMO] for 12 months by an independent third party,” Kehler explains. “If you’re making a cheese that’s aged a year, like Cabot clothbound cheddar, you need to start in March 2017, which means we have from now until March 2016 to figure this out.” Kehler is so concerned about making the deadline that he’s considering building his own feed mill and supplying it with non-GMO feed that he hopes to source himself. But that’s a pricey solution. “Hopefully it will be under a half a million dollars,” he says. “I’d rather a grain company do it.” The GMO problem extends far beyond Kehler’s industry. “Cheesemakers are just a tiny part of this,” he says. “It will also mean that other [Northeast-based] companies, like Chobani, Fage and Ben and Jerry’s, Applegate meats and the big dairy cooperatives, will all need to start shifting,” he says. Kehler is not the only one who’s worried about the issue. Almost 200 industry professionals attended a heated “Do You Know GMO” panel at the ACS show, and the topic of labeling was frequently mentioned in many other sessions. A buyer for a large southern grocery chain – who declined to be quoted for this story – admitted that GMO labeling is his number one concern. An unattainable ideal? Vermont-based cheesemaker Angela Miller of Consider Bardwell Farm is almost an ideal example of a sustainable producer. She uses organic hay, and her livestock – which includes cows and goats – are Animal Welfare Approved. In 2010, her 300-acre farm became the first grassland reserve permanent easement in Vermont. But even Miller finds it hard to meet the Whole Foods standard. “We do add corn feed, and for a long time, we fed organic feed, and then it was too expensive for us – it’s double the cost,” she says. “We went to conventional feed, which I’m sure is GMO, so we’ll have to label.” Miller worries that the GMO controversy is going to cost her more than a label. “I don’t want to take steps that will cost us more to pass along to the consumer,” she says. “Our goat cheese is already $26 a pound, and we already have the thinnest profit margin you’ve ever seen.” Another issue is rennet, the enzyme used to coagulate milk – an important step in the cheesemaking process. Traditional rennets come from the stomach of a baby calf, and vegetarian-based rennets are also available. However, another rennet, known as FPC (fermentation-produced chymosin), is produced through genetic engineering. It is used in an estimated 90% of the cheeses made in the US. “I’ve asked our supplier if they could send an affidavit that it’s non-GMO,” Miller says, noting that she faces pressure from consumers. “We’re in seven New York City farmers’ markets and Vermont farmers’ markets. Our customers face us every day and hit us with these questions. I don’t want to say our cheese is non-GMO if I can’t prove it.” Up and down the supply chain Cathy Strange, global cheese buyer for Whole Foods, says she works closely with the hundreds of cheese makers and farmers who are scrambling to meet Whole Foods guidelines. Unlike the retailer’s aquaculture standards, which are already in place and openly displayed on the company’s website, the standards for cheese and dairy products are still in the works. “We’re clearer on them than when we first announced this in March 2013,” she says, but the standards are still being reviewed. The main criteria for GMO labeling, Strange says, is feed. The issue has become so important that Whole Foods has stepped in on the sourcing end. It has hired a person from the feed industry to work for its global commodities team sourcing non-GMO crops for everything from feed for livestock to ingredients for the crackers that end up on the store’s shelves. Strange says that cheesemakers that haven’t made the conversion to non-GMO feed for milk-producing livestock by the 2018 deadline won’t immediately lose a place on the shelf. However, they will have to label their products accordingly. “The first iteration is transparency around labeling, and then to move them into a situation where they are GMO-free,” Strange explains. “In essence, that’s our goal and we want them to come along with our goal, and will provide the help.” As for cheesemakers who don’t convert to non-GMO feed, “Eventually, they would be at risk of losing a spot.” For some producers, this could be devastating. Cheesemaker David Gremmels, known for his creamy Rogue River Blue cheese – and his signature blue shoes – says that Whole Foods is a crucial retail partner for his company. “Our cheese is present in every one of their cheese counters in the Americas and the UK,” he says. Jackson County, Oregon, where Gremmels’s company is based, is the nation’s hot-spot on the issue. It voted to ban GMO crops in May. But Gremmels says that his company, Rogue Creamery, made the conscious decision to move towards non-GMO products back in 2007, long before the Whole Foods mandate. Maintaining that commitment isn’t always easy. Gremmels is launching a new dairy facility this year, featuring a state-of-the-art milking system that allows cows to decide when to be milked. When cows volunteer to be milked by walking up to the milking station, they’ll get a food reward of grain. Whole Foods is helping Gremmels source non-GMO feed. “We want to have full transparency to the feed,” says Strange. “Ten years ago, we’d be having the same conversation around how do your partners feel about rBST-free milk. I feel confident that our partners understand and embrace getting to a product they feel comfortable isn’t a modified product.” Clare Leschin-Hoar is a California-based freelance writer covering seafood, sustainability and food politics.

114,article,sustainable-business/2014/jul/16/ngo-claims-biotech-foods-gmos-emails,Guardian Sustainable Business,2014-07-16,A deeper dive into NGO’s claims on biotech foods,https://gu.com/p/4vxp5,,A deeper dive into NGO’s claims on biotech foods,<p>This page contains background information about a story on NGOs and GMOs that ran on 16 July</p>,8888,"This is background information about my story, ""Why NGOs can't be trusted on GMOs"", which ran on 16 July. The beginning The story began when I read a long and detailed commentary by L. Val Giddings, a senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a consultant to the biotech industry and a former government regulator, critiquing 2013 testimony by Michael Hansen of Consumers Union to the New York state legislature. The claims in the testimony have been repeated elsewhere by Hansen, and I was struck by how many of them did not appear, to me, to stand up to scrutiny by Giddings. You can read Giddings’ commentary here (pdf). I subsequently emailed Michael Hansen with a few specific questions about Giddings’ claims. Here is my email to Dr Hansen on 18 June: Dear Mr. Hansen, Thanks for calling. I was reaching out because I'm working on a story on what I believe to be misstatements or distortions by a number of NGOs around the issue of GMOs. In your case, I am hoping you can respond to the criticisms of your testimony to the NY legislature made by Val Giddings in a recent blog post. I've attached the PDF of his critique. I wouldn't expect you to go through the whole thing, so here are several examples of what I am talking about. 1. On p. 1 of the pdf, you write: the US does not require genetically engineered foods to be proven safe before they can go on the market despite significant safety concerns. You can see Mr. Giddings' response over the next four or five pages. The question is, how can a food be ""proven safe"" – is that possible, and is it a standard that could be applied to conventional foods? And what are the ""significant safety concerns"" that we should worry about, given that many scientific bodies have found that foods with GMOs are as safe or safer as other foods. 2. On p. 7, you write: In June of [2012], the American Medical Associations House of Delegates, they changed their position to one where now they support mandatory premarket safety assessment. This is true but out of context. The AMA opposes labeling, which is the point of the hearing. The AMA has also affirmed the safety of the GMO foods now on the market, correct? 3. Why would you cite the Seralini study, which has been discredited and retracted? (This testimony is from 2013, so perhaps that was before it was retracted.) 4. On p. 11, you write that we have no independent safety testing of these crops in the US because of intellectual property rights concerns. This is misleading, it seems to me. Here is a long blog post that challenges the claim that all of the studies of GMOs are funded by industry. It's a good summary of the independent studies out there. Admittedly, many are in Europe and funded by the EU but the impression given from your statement is that all of the studies are done by industry. I wouldn't go so far as to say your testimony is false but it seems to me to be not merely one-sided but misleading. I will try to keep an open mind about this, though, and wait to hear back. I am hoping to write this next week. Thanks for your help. Sincerely, Marc Gunther Here's his response to me, sent 20 June: Dear Marc, Thanks for your email. Here are my responses to your questions. After you've had some time to read this, perhaps we could speak by phone. 1. In terms of your first question, I stand by my statement that GE foods are not required to be proven safe. They should be ""proven safe"" in the same way that food additives and artificial colors are under our Food, Drugs and Cosmetics Act (FDCA). The legal safety standard under FDCA for food additives and artificial colors is ""reasonable certainty of no harm."" The FDCA then outlines the kinds of tests, and how they should be carried out, that are need to meet the legal criterion of ""reasonable certainty of no harm."" FDA can and should do the same for GE foods. You ask about the “significant safety concerns” that should be addressed. There has been global agreement at Codex Alimentarius that GE foods are different than conventionally bred foods and that all GE foods should be required to go through a safety assessment prior to marketing. Codex Alimentarius is the food safety standards organization of the United Nations, and is jointly run by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (Who). From 2000 – 2008, Codex developed a number of documents, including a Guideline for the Conduct of Food Safety Assessment of Foods Derived from Recombinant-DNA Plants (CAC/GL 45, 2003); and Guidelines for GE animals and GE microorganisms, as well. Codex concluded that GE foods should be tested for potential changes in toxins, allergens, nutritional impacts as well as unexpected effects. The EU, Japan, China, Australia and New Zealand all require GE foods to be assessed for these significant safety concerns. Examples of potential health problems raised by GE foods that deserve further study can be seen in my submission to the AMA Council on Science and Public Health, “Reasons for labeling of genetically engineered foods,” which I sent to AMA on March 19, 2012. 2. Regarding the AMA, in my testimony, I thought it relevant to note that AMA’s House of Delegates had changed their policy on GE. I noted that the AMA changed their position to one that states “Our AMA supports mandatory pre-market systematic safety assessments of bioengineered foods and encourages: (a) development and validation of additional techniques for the detection and/or assessment of unintended effects; (b) continued use of methods to detect substantive changes in nutrient or toxicant levels in bioengineered foods as part of a substantial equivalence evaluation; (c) development and use of alternative transformation technologies to avoid utilization of antibiotic resistance markers that code for clinically relevant antibiotics, where feasible; and (d) that priority should be given to basic research in food allergenicity to support the development of improved methods for identifying potential allergens.” This change in position is an implicit admission that GE foods may have an adverse health impact, otherwise why would you change your position to say that mandatory premarket safety assessments should be performed. To me, this was relevant to the labeling question since labeling could help a consumer identify an unexpected health effect, especially from an allergen. As for AMA support of GE foods, that support is qualified as they do admit there can be safety concerns. The AMA’s Council on Science and Public Health even notes “a small potential for adverse events … due mainly to horizontal gene transfer, allergenicity, and toxicity.” That is why they changed their position to come out in support of “mandatory, premarket systematic safety assessments” of GE foods. 3. You ask why I cite the Séralini study. You are correct that my testimony was on 30 July 2013 before the Séralini study was retracted in November, 2013. However, I believe the retraction was unjustified and continue to cite the study. The Editor-in-Chief of Food and Chemical Toxicology (FCT), when announcing the retraction of the Séralini study noted that “the results presented (while not incorrect) are inconclusive, and therefore do not reach the threshold of publication for Food and Chemical Toxicology.” The editor-in-chief also clearly stated that he “found no evidence of fraud or intentional misrepresentation of the data.” The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines for retracting articles list four reasons for retraction: scientific misconduct/honest error, prior publication, plagiarism, or unethical research. None of these reasons apply to the Séralini et al. study. More than 150 scientists have signed a statement condemning the retraction of the article as an attack on scientific integrity and demanding that FCT reinstate the study. The US National Institutes of Health (NIH)-associated publication, Environmental Health Perspectives also recently published an editorial, signed by Dr. Lynn Goldman, who was the Assistant Administrator for Toxic Substance at EPA from 1993 – 1998 and is now the Dean of the Milliken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University. The editorial concluded, “Efforts to suppress scientific findings, or the appearance of such, erode the scientific integrity upon which the public trust relies. .... We feel the decision to retract a published scientific work by an editor, against the desires of the authors, because it is “inconclusive” based on a post hoc analysis represents a dangerous erosion of the underpinnings of the peer-review process, and Elsevier [publisher] should carefully reconsider this decision.” 4. As for my statement that “we have no independent safety testing of these crops in the US because of intellectual property rights concerns,” I stand by that statement as well. I was talking about the situation in the US and was not referring to work conducted in other countries. I don’t think I gave the impression that all the studies are done by industry. My point was that studies in the US cannot be undertaken without industry’s permission because the seeds are their intellectual property. Thus, no studies are entirely independent. The bottom line is that I and CU are not saying that all GE foods are dangerous, just as we’d never say that all potential food additives are dangerous. We do say that the US should require safety assessments on foods derived from GE organisms, and that those safety assessments should be consistent with the guidelines developed by the Codex Alimentarius Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Task Force on Foods Derived from Biotechnology. Thus, we are advocating for US to require that GE foods be proven safe (i.e. meaning “reasonable certainty of no harm”) before they are permitted on the market. I look forward to speaking with you about these comments and about any other issues associated with GE crops. Best, Michael Michael Hansen, Ph.D. Senior Scientist Consumers Union 101 Truman Ave. Yonkers, NY 10703 I will not respond to Hansen here except to say that the Seralini study has been widely discredited, even after its recent republication. Stonyfield’s Gary Hirshberg on research funding In the second section of the story, I challenge the claims from Stonyfield Farms chairman Gary Hirshberg and Hansen about industry influence or control over GMO studies. I requested a response from Hirshberg (who I know and like) to his claim, in a June blogpost, that “all the research conducted around the safety of genetically engineered crops has been funded by the GMO patent holders themselves."" Gary sent this reply a few weeks later, on 11 July: The key point in regard to our blog post, and that the record will clearly show, is that of the body of studies the regulatory agencies had to review prior to initial approvals of the new GE technologies, 99% or more of the health and safety data that the government had in its possession at the time of approvals was from industry-funded, designed, and controlled studies. In hindsight, I can see that I was not as clear on this point as I could have been. While many GE proponents point to the supposedly vast array of studies since the mid-90s that are supposed to prove the safety of these crops, the scientists we consult point out that in fact, the vast majority of the ""independent"" studies have focused just on nutritional equivalence or value as an animal feed. Most of these studies have required cooperation with the technology developer to, among other things, gain access to the isolines for controls in field trials. According to Dr. Chuck Benbrook of Washington State University, over the last 20 years, there have been around a dozen independently conducted studies designed primarily to assess food safety risks associated with all GE foods. Most required some consultations and cooperation with the technology developer, in order to gain access to probes, isolines, genetic markers, and other technical information and/or tools necessary to conduct a state-of-the-art study. Only a few of these studies exposed animals to GE foods over a period longer than 90 days. He further points out that there are several major, commercial GE traits on the market today, including some planted on tens of millions of acres like the eight-trait SmartStax corn, which have had no independent studies conducted on them resulting in publications in peer reviewed journals. I am not sure what topics your blog will be covering, so let me take a step back and underscore our position at Just Label It in regard to the topic of independent research. First, we are not opposed to GE technology per se. In fact, we recognize that there is potential for GE to yield significant crop, farmer and consumer benefits. Examples of promising potential GE benefits include engineering a species of casava with beta carotene, easing black spot and wilt with tomatoes, creating an acrylamide-free potato, reducing crown rot and substantial fungicide usage in strawberries (by putting a gene from strawberries back into strawberries), and avoiding apple scab. But when it comes to health, safety and other environmental impacts of these crops, the track record is clear that the herbicide-tolerant (HT) GE technologies that have been the primary GE species introduced into commerce have had the unfortunate result of increasing weed resistance and thus greater dependence on stronger herbicides (the so-called"" herbicide treadmill"") and this in turn has cast a shadow over GE technology, particularly because the opposite result (lower herbicide use) was promised and expected back in the 1990s and since. And while it is true that as a result of GE BT technology, farmers are spraying fewer insecticides, that does not mean that less overall pesticide is being used. Around 15% of corn is now sprayed with fungicides, whereas almost none was pre-1996, and many scientists think part of the reason is associated with genetic modification. The resistant corn rootworm problems would seem to indicate that BT is being over-used relative to historic applications. And scientists do not dispute that the BT toxin that has been engineered into plants is already activated and thus bio-available, and is not an encapsulated spore like the spray that binds to the insect's stomach. Thus, the GE version has a broader ecological impact than the spray version, which is very unstable in sunlight and breaks down with 12-48 hours after application. GE technologies have resulted in a packaging of genes and herbicides that protect the crop from weeds in a profoundly different manner than anything we've done before. Because GE HT traits result in a tight coupling of plant varieties and herbicides, we have engineered a profoundly strong selection pressure, made worse by the fact that the seed companies encourage adoption by rewarding farmers for buying more of the engineered seeds and associated herbicides (rebates, future discounts, quasi-crop insurance, money to pay for resprays, computers, trips, etc). One of the nation's leading weed scientists says that the data is clear that there were NO glyphosate resistant weeds between 1970 when glyphosate was widely introduced and 1996 when we brought in HT crops. We are creating positive feedback loops of dangerous unintended consequences. For instance, with alfalfa, farmers had a crop rotation option not reliant on Roundup, but the introduction of GE HT alfalfa has now significantly narrowed the pool of non-RR rotational crops. We are also selecting for an increasing number of weed species and now have 28 species that are resistant to glyphosate and 40-60m US acres now have infestations of glyphosate-resistant weeds. (A new industry estimate making the rounds last week put the number at 70m). There has been a troubling several decade-long pattern of denial on the part of the seed patent holders over the likelihood of resistance emerging - for example Monsanto authors of a 1997 paper asserted weed resistance would never happen. And now we are repeating the same glyphosate pattern by introducing traits that confer resistance to 2,4-D and dicamba, and the USDA now projects that if approved, 2,4-D resistant crops will lead to 3-7X increases in usage of 2,4-D in the US. It is widely agreed that 2,4-D is 4-400X more toxic than glyphosate. This should concern us all, because: Herbicides don't stay where they are applied They kill broad leafed plants nearby and in so doing also destroy pollinator habitats in these other hosts. There is increased likelihood they wind up where we don't want them - water notably In short, our position is that there have been and will continue to be negative unintended consequences of GE and we can and should do a better job of understanding these impacts before approving new crops for broad use. Part of the problem lies in the fact that our federal government, and particularly the USDA and FDA do no testing or independent analysis to confirm the patent holders' assertions about productivity, health, and safety. This is partly due to the fact that it is a violation of most GE patents for anyone other than the patent holder to conduct trials and tests – except when permission is granted by them, of course. This winds up creating a polarized environment in which no one trusts either side. JLI believes the government has a role to play in facilitating more independent research so that yield, safety, environmental and efficacy claims can be independently verified by interests that are not seeking to profit or recoup investments. The federal government has such a working protocol in place for drug testing and approval and we believe that both the patent holders and the farming and consuming publics could benefit from a more open and transparent FDA/USDA/EPA approval process in which, like the process of approving new drugs, a clear, objective, and fully transparent set of approval gates would be passed for each new application. As with the process of approving new drugs, this process would engage experts not employed by the patent holders and would independently test the applicants' assertions, taking into consideration relevant human and environmental health impacts. Meanwhile, particularly because the current GE business model appears to be engineered to result in the sale and use of more herbicides, there is no doubt that this is leading to increased herbicide resistance, and there is a real question whether the herbicide treadmill is enhancing or decreasing resilience and sustainability. This too needs to be carefully examined. And of course this is a matter that we feel is entirely material to the average citizen, let alone anyone who lives on or near farms, so it is one of the key reasons why we believe labeling is necessary, ie so consumers can know and choose whether to support a system of agriculture that drives more and greater usage of increasingly dangerous herbicides. I hope that this helps clarify our position. A response from Biology Fortified’s Karl Haro von Mogel I asked Karl Haro von Mogel, a director of nonprofit Biology Fortified who is building a database of GMO research, to respond to the claims from Gary and Michael Hansen. He replied on 1 July: At Biology Fortified, Inc., an independent non-profit, we are building a database of all the relevant research on genetically engineered crops having to do with their environmental and health safety, efficacy, and equivalence, which we call the GENetic Engineering Risk Atlas (Genera). (For more information, click here) Genera is not currently online for everyone to see yet, however, I have read and entered 400 studies out of the 1000-plus that we currently have in our library, and I can tell you what we have found out from this sample. When we started the project, we estimated that there would be roughly one-third of the studies funded by independent sources, such as governments and NGOs. From these 400, we have found that this has held true, and even more so. Between one-third and one-half (closer to one-half) are known to be funded by independent sources, while about one-fourth are funded by the industry, and about one-fourth have no funding information posted (and we have not so far been able to reach the authors). A handful of studies have been funded by individuals, competing industries, and NGOs both independent and affiliated with either industry. So right away, Hirshberg is completely wrong when he says that “all” of the research has been funded by corporations with vested interests. In fact, the largest known share of this research is funded by government agencies around the world. Hirshberg is repeating a poorly-researched talking point and does not appear to be familiar with the scientific literature at all. Dr. Hansen's statement is more nuanced. He's not talking about funding sources, but whether the researchers are 'truly' independent, which he does not define in this quote, but suggests what this means later in the testimony. He believes that all (or “virtually” all) of the research on genetically engineered crops is published only with the permission of the biotech companies that make them. He bases his claim on a 2009 Scientific American article concerning entomologists who wrote an open letter to the biotech companies saying that they had difficulty accessing genetically engineered seeds for research purposes, but completely omits the follow-ups to that article. It turns out that scientists at universities were already able to conduct independent research on GMO products (and many didn't know), and the companies themselves entered into agreements affirming the same thing. One of the things they can research under these agreements is the end-use of the crop, such as feeding it to animals and the effects thereof. The only thing they seem to want in return is notice about the study when you go to publish it, which is a professional courtesy in any field (and that you don't save or pirate the seeds). Dr. Steven Novella explored the story: http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/do-seed-companies-restrict-research/ Nathanael Johnson looked in more depth: http://grist.org/food/genetically-modified-seed-research-whats-locked-and-what-isnt/ There are naturally ways that this can be improved, and I don't doubt that it will be improved because I believe that independent access to seeds for research on safety and efficacy is necessary, and the companies stand to gain little by making it difficult. But what concerns me about Dr. Hansen's testimony is that he completely omits recognition of the events that have transpired in the past five years since the Scientific American article came out. This omission is an obvious mistake in expert testimony to lawmakers. The Consumers Union is affiliated with Consumer Reports, which tests products to report to consumers how they measure up. Has Consumer Reports ever tried to do the same for GMOs? My guess is no. I have myself sent an email to Monsanto asking about the possibility of getting seeds for a little independent experiment involving our blog’s readers, and the representative was open to providing them. I haven't formally requested any yet, so I can't say that they would give them to me without restrictions on publication, but if they do or don't it would make for an interesting blog post either way. But the point is this: access to these seeds for research purposes is possible. Dr. Hansen also wrote an opinion about the Judy Carman pig-feeding study published last year, which was conducted in the United States. While he rightly did not claim it was independent (it was funded by the competing industry), it was conducted without permission from the seed companies and no one was pursued legally for doing so. This study contradicts his claim, and I suppose he can fit that in under the word ""virtually."" However, he does not actually have evidence for his claim at all. He does not know that “virtually” all of the published research out there was conducted under a restrictive agreement that required approval before publication – he has not asked all of these researchers. He is assuming based on one letter in 2009 that “virtually” all of these researchers had their studies reviewed and approved by the biotech companies before publication. Dr. Hansen has presented “virtually” no evidence that this is true, and this is again a mistake to give in expert testimony to lawmakers. Dr. Hansen also frames the issue in a misleading way. If he was right that intellectual property restrictions kept US researchers from conducting studies on GMOs independently, you would still have the research that has been conducted outside the US, in countries that have different and even non-existent intellectual property rights systems on transgenic seeds. According to the 400 studies I have examined, about one-third had researchers from the US, and a similar fraction of studies were funded by US sources. Many of the rest of these studies were conducted in government agency labs in Japan, China, Sweden, Israel, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Norway, the UK, etc, and the companies have no control over this research. A study on MON 810 maize done outside the US is still a study done on MON 810 maize. He is arbitrarily narrowing the playing field to exclude what seems to be the majority of the scientific literature. The laws of gravity are the same no matter what side of the planet you are on, and the same goes for the safety of genetically engineered crops. There is no valid scientific reason to exclude research conducted by scientists outside the United States. I find it very troublesome that Dr. Hansen is arbitrarily excluding two-thirds of the scientific literature in his expert testimony. Moreover, he promotes the widely discredited and retracted 2012 Seralini rat study in his testimony, which was conducted in France – so he clearly does not believe that being conducted outside the US is a disqualifying factor. We are therefore left to wonder if he has a reason to exclude all this science, besides rhetoric? Even if we take his claim at face value, “virtually” one-third of the science not being “truly” independent isn’t even a convincing statement. Dr. Hansen is suggesting that the scientific literature cannot be trusted because he believes that the research is not “truly” independent, however there is a large body of independent research conducted both within and outside the United States that demonstrates that this is false. At the more extreme end, Gary Hirshberg’s statement is so wrong that it can hardly be taken seriously! I think it would be a lot better to take a more academic approach to determining the truth. I suggest that both Gary Hirshberg and Dr. Michael Hansen spend more time reading and understanding the scientific literature before they make such broad-sweeping and incorrect claims. There is a wealth of information available from research conducted by thousands of independent scientists around the world. This is one of the goals of our Genera project – to make it easier for academics, policymakers, pundits, members of industry, and the general public to see the breadth of peer-reviewed science that has been conducted around the world – and all of it – not just the part that one pundit or another wants you to see. Comments from AquaBounty on its salmon In the third section of the story, I challenge claims made by the Center for Food Safety about AquaBounty salmon. I did so in part after soliciting and receiving this response to the center’s mock “nutrition label” for the salmon from Ron Stotish, CEO of AquaBounty, on 27 June: Rebuttal of Center for Food Safety AquAdvantage (AAS) Salmon composition label: In the United States, the average height of a student entering the third grade is 45 inches. However, it would be foolish to expect that all children entering the third grade be exactly 45 inches tall, and all others be denied enrollment. There is natural genetic and environmental variation that leads to a variety of heights in children, but with an overall average of 45 inches. It would not be surprising if you measured height in two classrooms of 15 children each at an elementary school, one class studying reading and the other in music class, and found that the average height for the class studying reading was 44in, and the class studying music was 46 inches. Music class has not caused the children to suddenly have accelerated growth and become 5% taller. There really is no statistical difference in average height of one class versus the other when considering the normal natural biological variation in height. However, if the Center for Food Safety (CFS) analyzed this data, they would conclude and promote to consumers that music accelerates growth in children by 5%, if they were pro-music. Or they might conclude that reading depresses growth by 5%, if they were against reading. Both would of course be a completely wrong, misinformed, and confusing message to deliver to consumers. This is exactly the type of misguide analysis that the Center for Food Safety has applied to nutritional composition data for AquAdvantage Salmon. The values on the Center for Food Safety mock-label were generated based on the nutritional composition data included in the FDA-CVM briefing document issued in 2010, based a study conducted using AquAdvantage Salmon and appropriate control Atlantic salmon. The study was conducted in support of a New Animal Drug Application for AquAdvantage Salmon to the US FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM). Analysis of the nutritional composition of muscle samples of market sized (2-7.5kg) salmon was conducted in a GLP-compliant manner by third-party contract laboratories. The study involved size-matched diploid and triploid Atlantic salmon from three treatment groups: AquAdvantage Salmon Sponsor controls (SC); non-transgenic fish sourced from AquaBounty Canada’s facility Farmed controls (FC); non-transgenic fish sourced from commercial Atlantic salmon farms Sound science in making comparisons between population of animals (or third graders) requires considering the natural variation or whatever it is that is being measured. Biological variation makes it almost impossible for a biological parameter measured in two populations of animals to result in exactly the same value, and a comparison based on just a comparison of averages alone would never be promoted by an organization that cared about providing information that consumers can use to make informed decisions. An entire field of research, statistics, is devoted to detecting when differences between averages in populations are real and when they are just natural variation. Sadly, the Center for Food Safety chose to ignore this field of statistics in favor of ignorance Happily for the consumer, the U.S. FDA did apply statistical analysis when comparing the results for AquAdvantage Salmon with typical Atlantic salmon. They made their conclusions publically available to stakeholders, and found (p. 96 of the FDA Briefing Packet): ""Based on all previous criteria including statistical analysis, we conclude that levels of all analytes in ABT salmon are similar to levels in appropriate comparator salmon … We conclude that any differences observed for analytes are the result of normal biological variation, and are highly unlikely to be associated with toxicological or nutritional hazards to humans consuming ABT salmon."" The values found on the Center for Food Safety mock-label are a direct comparison of the average values for the growth hormone transgenic group relative to the sponsor control group, excluding any appreciation of natural variation and the range of measurements for that analyte. In creating and distributing this label, the Center for Food Safety has chosen to disregard the presented data generated for farmed control fish and they have provided no context for the implication of the perceived differences in nutritional composition between AquAdvantage Salmon and controls. Consideration of the results from farmed control animals is crucial because it establishes an expected range of variance for size-matched ‘control’ fish and it demonstrates that composition of AquAdvantage Salmon is not different from that of Atlantic salmon that are safely consumed every day. Finally, in comparing levels of important mega three-sixths fatty acids, comparisons by Center for Food Safety were for some reason drawn between AquAdvantage Salmon (Atlantic salmon) at a ratio of 3.6, and literature values for wild Pacific salmon at a value of 10.4, a completely different species (you might as well compare third graders and high school students). The comparison is not valid, not only because they are different species, but because the diets of farmed fish and wild fish are also completely different. Farmed Atlantic salmon are fed commercial diets formulated to contain a sufficient source of both EPA and DHA to satisfy the recommended daily intake (250-500mg per day). Wild Pacific salmon obviously eat whatever forage fish they can find. Both farmed Atlantic salmon and wild Pacific salmon are considered to be a significant source of omega three-sixths fatty acids (&gt;1500mg/3oz cooked portion). When making the appropriate comparison with reasonable comparators, comparing the omega 3/6 ratios between AquAdvantage Salmon (ratio of 3.6), Aqua Bounty Atlantic salmon controls (3.2) and farmed Atlantic salmon controls (3.9), there is no biological difference that can ascertained. Perhaps this is why Center for Food Safety ignored the data available for a valid comparison in evaluating AquAdvantage Salmon, and instead went far off track in looking for a difference in ratio and used a different species of fish as a comparator. Consumers should not be concerned that consumption of AquAdvantge Salmon will lead to any difference in omega-3 fatty acids in their diet, in spite of the misleading implication of the CFS label. When all of the results for all analytes measured in AquAdvantage Salmon are considered and compared with those of nontransgenic controls at AquaBounty (SC) and of Atlantic salmon from a fish farm (FC), the levels of each of the nutrients highlighted as “different” on the CFS label, with exception of vitamin B6, are clearly within the range of natural variability for Atlantic salmon, even without employing any statistical analysis. FDA examined the levels of vitamin B6 in detail, and correctly found that any differences were not biologically relevant and would not be any hazard to the consumer (second paragraph of p. 92 of FDA briefing packet). AquAdvantage Salmon are simply Atlantic salmon that grow faster. Any implication that nutritional differences exist is disingenuous at best, and definitely subverts a reasonable and productive discussion about the technology. There are enough real issues that should be discussed without willfully misinforming stakeholders and wasting intellectual capacity. The Center for Food Safety should be ashamed. Response from Center for Food Safety on AquaBounty salmon I asked the Center for Food Safety for a response, and received the following from Jaydee Hanson, senior policy analyst, on 11 July: “The values found on the Center for Food Safety mock-label are a direct comparison of the average values for the growth hormone transgenic group relative to the sponsor control group...” If AquaBounty feels that the study was not large enough to account for statistical variation then the fault lies with the study, not Center for Food Safety. We simply assessed the data presented, not the wishful thinking of AquaBounty. This is not a benign application of technology; we are comparing a genetically engineered fish that poses a significant environmental threat with reduced nutritional benefit to either non-GE farmed salmon or in the case of Omega 3 levels, wild salmon, but all of the data were those supplied by AquaBounty. While our label represents the available information, we do agree that much more testing must be done using the Codex Alimentarius Commission Guidelines (“Codex Guidelines”) to test the safety of eating these fish, which the FDA said it would do. Instead, FDA is relying on a substantial equivalence test intended for new animal drugs, not a human food. Under the Codex Guidelines, the safety assessment method recommended for whole foods is a much stricter multidisciplinary approach. Since whole foods are “a complex mixture of compounds, often characterized by a wide variation in composition and nutritional value, the Codex Guidelines warn that whole foods that have undergone genetic modification require a “more focused approach” when assessing their safety. Furthermore, the Codex Guidelines state multiple times that, in certain circumstances, such as where the data are insufficient or genetic modification changes the characteristic of a food, additional data or information may be necessary, and “…the use of appropriate conventional toxicology or other studies on the new substance may be necessary.” Indeed, a majority of countries require mid- and long-term toxicity tests for whole foods that have undergone genetic modification, asserting that a substantial equivalence test is not a viable measure to determine safety when such foods have been modified for their metabolism, as AquAdvantage has, because the altered characteristics are so unpredictable. The FDA’s failure to use the more rigorous safety assessment approach required by Codex Guidelines or the FDA’s own food additive review requirements, allowed the company to present data that was not sound statistically due to small sample sizes or improper sampling methods, such as its admitted culling of fish that looked bad. Recognizing the problems with the study, we simply printed the information in a format that can be easily understood by the public. We limited the chart to the confines of the study, but it does not display some of the most troubling data. The fish is engineered to contain constantly high growth hormone levels, which in turn can stimulate production of IGF-1, a hormone linked to a higher incidence of some cancers. According to the company’s data, an initial examination of IGF-1 in GE salmon showed increased levels. A second evaluation, which only examined diploid salmon, still showed higher mean levels although their significance was diminished by small sample sizes and the statistically improper inclusion of an additional salmon with non-detectable levels. (See VMAC packet at pg 68-69.) The company’s data on allerginity is also troubling. The FDA refused to accept data from one of the allerginity tests, which was conducted incorrectly. The other test was used on only 6 fish of the sort (the sterile triploid fish) that company says will it will sell as human food. The levels in the diploid (fertile) fish were high enough that the FDA said they should not be sold. Indeed, the allergenic potency for both triploid and diploid AquAdvantage salmon was, on average, between 19.5 and 52.5% higher, respectively, than non-GE salmon comparators (See Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee Packet at page 103.) During a meeting at the US House of Representatives, I asked Ron Stotish, the President of AquaBounty, if they intended to do human feeding trials related to the allerginity problems of their fish and would they redo the existing tests that were done incorrectly or with such small samples. He said that they had met with allergy specialists at Johns Hopkins University who recommended human trials, but that the company decided that they were too expensive. He did not answer my question about whether they would redo the allergy tests they had conducted that had data problems. By pretending to ignore the scientific evidence, AquaBounty is doing readers a disservice. Omega-3 to omega-6 ratio levels were also decreased in their GE salmon compared to both the standard value for farmed salmon and the value for wild caught salmon. We used in our chart the value for wild caught salmon the company presented in Table 28 (VMAC briefing p. 95) In short, our chart is intended to highlight the company’s own data. We give it a skull and cross bones warning as we don’t have enough good data to make any other determination. The fault lies both with the company and the FDA. They both have tried to take too many short cuts in their rush to get their product to unsuspecting consumers.

Available at: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/VeterinaryMedicineAdvisoryCommittee/UCM224762.pdf The end I don’t expect that my story, or this background data, will change many minds when it comes to GMOs. But I hope that it will cause some readers to see that the claims about GMOs made by Hansen, Hirshberg and the Center for Food Safety do not reflect the scientific consensus and depend upon a selective reading of the evidence. An epilogue After my story was published, the Consumers Union wrote a letter to the editor strongly disagreeing with its conclusions. Here is the email, which was written by Jean Halloran, director of food policy initiatives at the Consumers Union, to Jennifer Kho, the US editor of Guardian Sustainable Business, on 18 July: Dear Jennifer, We read with growing concern and dismay Marc Gunther's article and accompanying post entitled Why NGOs Can’t Be Trusted on GMOs. I am writing to you in my capacity as Director of Food Policy Initiatives at Consumers Union, the policy arm of Consumer Reports, one of the organizations Gunther states can not be trusted. I write as well as head of the department in which Michael Hansen, Ph.D, who is quoted in the article, is Senior Scientist. We are one of the organizations that Gunther says ""don't always stick to the truth."" I am writing to protest this characterization in the strongest possible terms, which borders on character defamation. I am also contacting you as Gunther's editor, because we do not believe Gunther has adhered to normal journalistic standards, or carried out the kind of first-rate reporting we normally see at the Guardian, in preparing this article. Mr. Gunther, like all reporters, will form opinions in the course of reporting a story. However we would expect that a writer at the Guardian would approach a story with an open mind and report with fairness. While Mr. Gunther intended to focus a great deal of his article on criticisms of Dr. Hansen's testimony before state legislative hearings, particularly criticisms leveled by Dr. Val Giddings, who has testified at hearings for the Biotechnology Industry Organization, Gunther never interviewed Dr. Hansen or spoke to him. This, despite both our communications consultant and Dr. Hansen offering a phone conversation between the two. Rather, Mr. Gunther chose to ask a series of questions in writing, by e-mail, to which Dr. Hansen responded, offering to talk further. Dr. Hansen's e-mail was posted in its entirety in a linked document. However Dr. Hansen's written answers were never incorporated in or referred to in Mr. Gunther’s article. They were in fact ignored. Thus, Mr. Gunther criticizes Dr. Hansen for saying that the U.S. ""does not require genetically engineered plants to be proven safe.” Mr. Gunther agrees that is a true statement but states that it is impossible to prove GMOs are safe. Dr. Hansen addressed exactly what he meant by ""proven safe"" in his email to Mr. Gunther--that we think all GMOs should go through a safety assessment like they do in Europe, and like food additives go through in the U.S. This is what Dr. Hansen and Consumers Union mean by ""proven safe"" and it is clearly something that is possible to do andfor whichthere are regulatory precedents. Yet Mr. Gunther failed to incorporate any of this explanation in his article. Dr. Hansen's quote is presented under Mr, Gunther's introductory statement that ""two of the main NGO arguments around GMOs just don't hold up to scrutiny: 1) GMOs are unhealthy."" This however has never been Consumers Union's position. As Dr. Hansen explicitly stated in this e-mail: ""The bottom line is that I and CU are not saying that all GE foods are dangerous, just as we’d never say that all potential food additives are dangerous. We do say that the U.S. should require safety assessments on foods derived from GE organisms, and that those safety assessments should be consistent with the guidelines developed by the Codex Alimentarius Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Task Force on Foods Derived from Biotechnology.” (Codex is the UN food standards agency.) Thus, Mr. Gunther creates a straw man, attacking us for a position that we have never held. Further on, Mr. Gunther states that Dr. Hansen ""is misleading"" and is ""intellectually dishonest"" when he says that ""there is virtually no independent safety testing of these crops in the U.S. due to intellectual property right problems."" Again, however, Mr. Gunther agrees this is true (""his statement may be factually defensible"") but quotes an article in Grist as providing evidence to the contrary. Dr. Hansen was never given an opportunity to explain why he thought, and still thinks, as many agree, that the Grist article does not give the full story. His written response to Mr. Gunther more fully explaining his viewwas again not incorporated inthe article. Compounding the lack of fair reporting, Mr. Gunther sent Dr. Hansen’s e-mail to Karl Haro von Mogel, a Ph.D. candidate in plant genetics and director of the non-profit Biology Fortified, to critique further, and published a lengthy comment from Mr. von Mogel on the Guardian website along with Dr. Hansen’s e-mail. Dr. Hansen was not informed this was being done, nor did he ever get a chance to respond or reply to the new set of criticisms. Dr. Hansen is not only a long and valued Senior Scientist at Consumers Reports, which has 8 million paid subscribers to its print and web publications. He is also a globally recognized expert on GMOs and their safety risks. He served on three World Health Organization expert consultations for example, including the 2003 FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on the Safety Assessment of Foods Derived from Genetically Modified Animals, including Fish and the 2007 FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on the Safety Assessment of Foods Derived from Recombinant-DNA Animals. The Guardian has done a disservice to its readers as well as Dr. Hansen's reputation, with this article. We urge you to 1) cite corrections to the article based on this letter; 2) conduct additional reporting, using a reporter who can approach the issue with more objectivity and who adheres to fair journalistic standards ; and 3) allow for this letter to be reprinted as a response and accompany Gunther’s article. Thank you for considering these views. Jean Halloran Director, Food Policy Initiatives Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports 101 Truman Ave Yonkers, NY 10703 Friends of the Earth also wrote a letter to the editor taking issue with some of my points. Here is the email, which was written by Lisa Archer, director of Friends of the Earth's food and technology program, to Kho on 23 July: Dear Jennifer Kho: We are disappointed with the weak and biased reporting in Marc Gunther’s story, “Why NGOs can’t be trusted on GMOs.” To summarily criticize Friends of the Earth without seeking our comment seems to disregard standard journalistic practice. Had we been asked, our response to his charge that our position on GMOs is “emotional” and not science based, we would have explained: The totality of evidence available on genetically engineered foods – including studies that raise health concerns; the limitations of existing research, lack of long-term studies and significant extent of industry control over the research agenda; the well-documented increase in herbicide use driven by GE crops and growing evidence of health risks associated with those chemicals; and the environmental problems that have become evident, including weed and bug resistance, risks to non-human species, contamination of non-GE crops and loss of seed diversity – leads us to conclude that GE foods can pose serious risks to our health and the environment. It is fair enough to scrutinize the claims of NGOs on genetically modified foods, but Mr. Gunther does a disservice to his readers by not holding the pro-GMO side, or his own writing, to the same standard. For example, his reporting: Relies on industry talking points in discussing science: His story states: “The fact is, hundreds of studies have been unable to identify any health risks posed by foods containing biotech crops, according to the industry and the FDA, which says that GMOs on the market are safe to eat.” This statement is wrong. While the Biofortified website, which Mr. Gunther cites as a source in his story, lists 600 studies conducted on genetically engineered crops, many of these deal with performance characteristics and other aspects of GE irrelevant to health risks. Most of the studies on the list do not reach anywhere near what the scientific community considers adequate to assess health risks, which should include carefully designed, long-term animal feeding studies. Several studies on the list do raise health concerns such as allergenic potential and organ toxicity.[i] Mischaracterizes the level of scientific debate in the on GE technology: The story suggests that the scientific community is settled on the question of GE food safety, but this is not the case. Mr. Gunther fails to include, for example, any reference to the letter signed by more than 200 scientists, MDs and academics citing the lack of scientific consensus on GMO safety. The letter details how the science on GMOs is frequently misreported, including an explanation of why it is wrong to claim that, “hundreds of studies have been unable to find any health effects.” The letter concludes that, “the totality of scientific research outcomes in the field of GM crop safety is nuanced, complex, often contradictory or inconclusive, confounded by researchers’ choices, assumptions, and funding sources, and in general, has raised more questions than it has currently answered. “Whether to continue and expand the introduction of GM crops and foods into the human food and animal feed supply, and whether the identified risks are acceptable or not, are decisions that involve socioeconomic considerations beyond the scope of a narrow scientific debate and the currently unresolved biosafety research agendas. These decisions must therefore involve the broader society. They should, however, be supported by strong scientific evidence on the long-term safety of GM crops and foods for human and animal health and the environment, obtained in a manner that is honest, ethical, rigorous, independent, transparent, and sufficiently diversified to compensate for bias.” Omits important context: This problem is rampant in Mr. Gunther’s story. As one example, Mr. Gunther cites a 2012 statement by “…the prestigious American Association for the Advancement of Science” as a definitive-sounding source on the safety of GMOs, without disclosing that the statement was challenged in an open letter by many long-standing AAAS members. The AAAS statement had clear political motivations; it was released the day before Californians went to the polls to vote on Proposition 37 for GMO labeling. The statement was based not on a review of science but rather closely hewed to talking points written by the No on Proposition 37 campaign. Author Michele Simon noted the comparisons between the AAAS statement and campaign talking points here. These facts seem relevant in a story about talking points. Mr. Gunther does readers a disservice by taking the AAAS statement at face value without noting the controversy, or holding it to the same standard he is holding other NGOs. This type of biased reporting fails to meet the standard of excellence we expect from the Guardian. We do agree, however, with Mr. Gunther on the need for a rational debate about GMOs, based on science not scare mongering – and that must include reporting on the complicated nature of the science and the realities of industry influence on the political and scientific processes. We respectfully request that you include our letter in the responses to his piece, and we welcome reporting in the Guardian that takes a deeper and more even-handed look at the risks and concerns associated with genetically engineered food.

115,article,sustainable-business/2014/jul/16/ngos-nonprofits-gmos-genetically-modified-foods-biotech,Guardian Sustainable Business,2014-07-16,Why NGOs can't be trusted on GMOs,https://gu.com/p/4vxzn,,Why NGOs can’t be trusted on GMOs,"<p>Non-profits are usually considered trustworthy, especially compared to corporations and governments. But when it comes to genetically modified foods, they don’t always stick to the truth</p>",2159,"When non-profit organizations do battle with big business, the non-profits – or public interest groups, if you prefer – have a major advantage: They are trusted, far more than corporations or the government. This helps explain why so many people – 48%, according to Gallup – believe that foods produced using genetic engineering pose a serious health hazard, despite assurances from corporations, government regulators and mainstream scientists that the genetically modified organisms (GMOs) now on the market are safe and, indeed, have been studied, tested and regulated more than any other food product in history. Who, after all, are you going to believe: Monsanto, one of the most hated companies on the planet, or Friends of the Earth? When the Center for Food Safety warns of the dangers of genetically modified salmon, which it calls “Frankenfish,” retailers and restaurants pay attention – even if the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says it’s safe to eat. And if we turn to the widely admired Consumer Reports for its ratings of cars and refrigerators, why not follow the advice of its parent company, Consumers Union, which warns of the dangers of biotech food? The reason is that advocacy groups – no matter what the issue – are not immune to pressures like other social institutions, as we’ll explain below. So at the very least, the arguments of NGOs should be subjected to the skepticism and fact-checking that is brought to bear on the claims made by business or government. And it turns out that two of the main NGO arguments around GMOs just don’t hold up to scrutiny: 1) GMOs are unhealthy Let’s begin with the most emotional issue – the impact of GMOs on human health. Friends of the Earth says: We have a right to food that is good for our bodies and our environment. Numerous studies show that genetically engineered foods can pose serious risks to both. Michael Hansen, a senior scientist at Consumers Union, has testified (pdf): The US does not require genetically engineered plants to be proven safe before they go on the market. The Organic Consumers Association says GM crops: Can be toxic, allergenic or less nutritious than their natural counterparts. Read those claims carefully. It’s true that GE foods can pose risks. So can most everything else sold in the supermarket or health food store, including, most recently, chicken, bean sprouts and cheese, not to mention the sodas, sugary cereals and snacks that contribute to diabetes and obesity. While Hansen doesn’t actually say that GMOs are unsafe - and says explicitly in an email to me that “I and [Consumers Union] are not saying that all GE foods are dangerous” - his implication clearly is that some GMO foods are unsafe; otherwise, they wouldn’t need testing. It’s also true that the US “does not require genetically engineered plants to be proven safe.” But it’s impossible to prove that GMOs or, for that matter, conventional foods are safe. The question is, where is the evidence that indicates that the GMOs on the market are unsafe? Are they any riskier than the food you buy at the grocery store, a farmer’s market or a restaurant? The fact is, hundreds of studies have been unable to identify any health risks posed by foods containing biotech crops, according to the industry and the FDA, which says that GMOs on the market are safe to eat. Last year, in the journal Nature Biotechnology, a story headlined “How Safe Do Transgenic Crops Need to Be?” looked at 20 years of peer-reviewed studies of possible health effects of GMOs and reported that: Critics and proponents of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) alike agree that genetically modified foods have failed to produce any untoward health effects, and that the risk to human health from foods contaminated with pathogens is far greater than from GMOs. If you choose not to believe the industry, the government or a respected scientific journal, consider what America’s doctors, through the American Medical Association (AMA), say about biotech crops and human health: Bioengineered foods have been consumed for close to 20 years, and during that time, no overt consequences on human health have been reported and/or substantiated in the peer-reviewed literature. Finally, here’s what the prestigious American Association for the Advancement of Science, said in a 2012 statement: The science is quite clear: crop improvement by the modern molecular techniques of biotechnology is safe. Consuming foods containing ingredients derived from GM crops is no riskier than consuming the same foods containing ingredients from crop plants modified by conventional plant improvement techniques. 2) The research on GMOs can’t be trusted Opponents of biotech crops discount the safety studies, which brings us to a second frequently heard claim: that you can’t trust the research on GMOs because the studies are controlled or funded by industry: Gary Hirshberg of Stonyfield Farm wrote on the Just Label It website that: … all the research conducted around the safety of genetically engineered crops has been funded by the GMO patent holders themselves. Michael Hansen of Consumers Union, testified before a state legislature (pdf) earlier this year: … there is virtually no independent safety testing of these crops in the US due to intellectual property right problems. Hirshberg’s claim is wrong. Hansen’s is misleading. The European Commission spent more than 200m euros of public funds on GMO research between 2001 and 2010. The EU summarizes about 50 studies in this 264-page report, which is easily found online. I tried to politely point this out in a comment on Hirshberg’s Just Label It blog, but my comment was not approved for publication. The blog has been shared more than 2,000 times on Facebook, spreading misinformation. Hirshberg has told me by email that he stands by the claim. As for Hansen, his use of qualifiers like “virtually” and “in the US” means that his statement may be factually defensible, but it is intellectually dishonest because it implies an absence of independent research. Karl Haro von Mogel, who is compiling a database of GMO studies at the website Biofortified, says he has read and catalogued about 400 studies, more than a third of which are independently funded. He couldn’t say how many of the independent studies were performed in the US, but notes that “a study on MON 810 maize done outside the US is still a study done on MON 810 maize”. Worse, Hansen backs up his claim, which he has repeated in testimony to several state legislatures, by quoting from a 2009 letter to the EPA written by 26 public-sector scientists: “as a result of restricted access, no truly independent research can be legally conducted on many critical questions regarding the technology.” Since that letter five years ago, those scientists have gotten access to genetically modified seeds for research purposes. In fact, Monsanto, the bête noire of anti-GMO activists, had actually already made its seeds available to independent researchers before the letter was written. Nathanael Johnson, a journalist who has carefully researched GMOs, dug into this issue last year for Grist, so it’s no secret that the 2009 complaint cited by Hansen is out of date. Case study: AquaBounty salmon All this back and forth may seem academic. It’s not. A company called AquaBounty has invested more than $70m in developing a faster-growing salmon that it says will improve the productivity and sustainability of salmon farming. The FDA found the biotech salmon do not pose a threat to the environment and are “as safe as food from conventional Atlantic salmon”, with “no biologically relevant difference”. But it may never reach stores, as a result of a hard-hitting campaign launched by the Center for Food Safety, Consumers Union, Food and Water Watch and Friends of the Earth. The campaign has successfully kept genetically modified salmon off the shelves of about 60 supermarkets, including Kroger’s, Safeway, Target, Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods Market. It sent this “nutrition label” (pdf) for the salmon to numerous restaurants and retailers and asked them not to sell the fish. (Note that this isn’t about labeling or choice; it’s about keeping a product off the market.) Complete with skull and crossbones, the mock label cherry picks data from a 180-page FDA analysis to suggest that the salmon are unsafe and unhealthy – just the opposite of what the FDA found. The label disingenuously misleads consumers. Why use imagery usually used to indicate poison? Jaydee Hanson, a senior policy analyst at the center, responded by email: “We give it a skull and cross bones warning as we don’t have enough good data to make any other determination. The fault lies both with the company and the FDA. They both have tried to take too many short cuts in their rush to get their product to unsuspecting consumers.” Most would agree that genetically modified salmon should be thoroughly examined, regulated and debated before it’s put on the market. But it’s hard to have an intelligent conversation about the risks and benefits of biotech salmon in the face of this type of scare campaign. Better arguments Let’s be clear. None of this is to suggest that there aren’t legitimate reasons to oppose GMOs. There are. The industry’s track record of managing biotech crops does not inspire confidence: On at least two occasions, biotech crops – corn in one case and rice in another – that were not approved for human consumption inadvertently found their way into the food system. GMOs, so far, have enabled homogenized monocultures more than crop diversity. The patenting of genes raises intellectual property issues. And the benefits of GMOS have been oversold by the industry: they haven’t, so far, done much to feed the hungry. That’s why we need a rational debate about GMOs, one that’s based on science and not scare-mongering. Like any new technology, biotech agriculture brings with it risks and benefits. Both are real. But there’s little doubt that genetic engineering could turn out to a valuable technology that, if properly managed, could help to deliver abundant, affordable, sustainable and healthy food to many millions of people. For consumers of information, though, the more important point is this: Be skeptical about the claims of NGOs, whether we’re talking about GMOs or anything else. After all, non-profits and the people who lead them are subject to the same temptations, pressures and incentives that drive companies: They are self-interested. They seek attention in a noisy marketplace. And they rely on the financial support of donors, just as companies depend on customers. As it happens, some of the groups opposed to the spread of GMOS are backed largely by corporate interests: Just Label It, a dot-org coalition that favors GMO labels is financed by organic and “natural” food companies that benefit from the anxiety around biotech food. A matter of trust The issue of credibility goes well beyond GMOs, of course. What’s the most effective way to improve the lives of the world’s poorest people? It’s hard to know whether a comprehensive approach (the Millennium Villages), major health initiatives (the Gates Foundation), micro enterprise (Kiva) or disaster relief (Care) will work best. Each NGO understandably touts its own approach. Meanwhile, economists say trade has done more than aid to help the global poor. Can the US economy be powered without fossil fuels or nuclear energy by 2025 or even 2050? The Sierra Club and Greenpeace say so, but they don’t say that electricity generated by wind or solar power costs much more than power from coal or natural gas. Business-friendly NGOs like the World Wildlife Fund and the Nature Conservancy, meanwhile, don’t talk much about the environmental costs of overconsumption or eating meat – perhaps because their corporate partners, board members and major donors don’t want to be told they are part of the problem. That said, many NGOs have earned the trust that we give them. They are vital watchdogs for powerful institutions, including business and government, which may be why, for seven years in a row, they have been ranked as the most trusted institutions by the annual Edelman Trust Barometer. But as Richard Edelman, the president and CEO of the big global PR firm, says: “NGOs should not be self-satisfied.” It takes a long time to build trust, and not nearly as long to squander it. • For those who want to dig even deeper into this topic, view additional background documents, and an explanation of how this story was reported, here. • After this piece was published, the Consumer Union and Friends of the Earth wrote letters to the editor that disagreed with its conclusions.

I once saw a postcard from Brian Friel, on holiday in France, who wrote: ""Here for two weeks. One, with good behaviour."" I know what he means. In these dog days, I'm reading Charles Townshend's The Republic: The Fight for Irish Independence, a marvellous and beautifully judged study of that strange war. Cheating a little – because it's not due for publication until October – I have a proof copy of Colm Tóibín's luminous new novel, Nora Webster, set in Enniscorthy and environs in the late 1960s, and bound to be an enormous success. As for a classic, I'm afraid I'm rereading – oh dear – Nietzsche's The Gay Science, in a fine translation by Josefine Nauckhoff. This I consider Nietzche's greatest work, though I wish translators would call it The Cheerful Science, which is a far better and far less ambiguous Englishing of Fröhliche Wissenschaft, with its sly echo of ""frolics"". For in these pages, frolics abound. Ali Smith Novelist I'm home for my summer holidays this year (taking an autumn holiday) with the pile of new books I've been waiting to read for months, including Paul Bailey's The Prince's Boy, Sebastian Barry's The Temporary Gentleman, Neel Mukherjee's The Lives of Others and Jacqueline Rose's forthcoming Women in Dark Times. Four writers I love, four brand new works, a surfeit of elegance and intelligence. Could summer get any better? Yes – a friend has just sent me Chekhov's About Love and Other Stories, translated by Rosamund Bartlett. First line: ""A sweltering, muggy midday. Not a cloud in the sky."" (If you're looking for me, I'm in the garden.) Naomi Wolf Author of Vagina: A New Biography I am in the Hudson River Valley surrounded by beautiful thunderstorms, and reading the original 1855 edition of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass for my doctoral thesis. Whitman hand-set the type and printed the volume himself, which I find quite moving. I also picked up a copy of David Perlmutter's Grain Brain, which makes the case that GMO-affected wheat, such as we are forced to eat in the US, is having terrible neurological effects on health. William Dalrymple Writer and historian I'm looking forward to sitting by the pool outside Siena reading two classy new Indian novels – Akhil Sharma's Family Life and Deepti Kapoor's A Bad Character, both of which have received tremendous acclaim. For my big non-fiction read for the summer, I'll be taking on the second half of a huge, extraordinary tome on the deep past of the Mediterranean, The Making of the Middle Sea by Cyprian Broodbank. It's a wonderfully sweeping and oddly unputdownable history of the region and full of the oddest facts imaginable – for example, in Mesopotamia c1750BC, a large piece of rock crystal was worth 3,000 sheep and 60 male slaves. Broodbank is especially gripping on the Neanderthals, who ate peas, acorns, ostrich eggs and tortoises, built weapons but not boats, and lived ""brief, hard lives of uncertain cognitive depth"". The last stand of the Neanderthals was in Spain, where there is some evidence of inter-breeding and hybridity between us and our distant, defeated cousins. ""It is a thought-provoking geographical coincidence, or no coincidence at all, that Iberia was the focus for the earliest hominins in Mediterranean Europe, and the place from where the last who were not us walked out forever into the night."" Highly recommended. Teju Cole Novelist I return every summer to George Seferis's Complete Poems, in the translation by Edmund Keeley and Philip Sherrard. Also on my desk at the moment are Peter Stamm's stories We're Flying and Rana Dasgupta's Capital: A Portrait of 21st-Century Delhi. I'm excited by the new-to-me poet Sarah Lindsay and have been dipping into her Debt to the Bone-Eating Snotflower. And I'm also reading two academic titles connected to my current project of writing about Lagos: Kristin Mann's Slavery and the Birth of an African City: Lagos, 1760–1900, and Brian Larkin's study of infrastructure in Nigeria, Signal and Noise. Helen Dunmore Novelist On holiday in Italy a few weeks ago, I read Philipp Meyer's novel The Son for its gripping story of a young boy, Eli McCullough, abducted into a Comanche band in mid-19th-century Texas. I was also reading Emily Dickinson, who would have been Eli's contemporary. Their worlds are so different, but there's something Comanche in Dickinson's poetry. For many years, I found it daunting but now I love it. It's as fearsome and technically brilliant as the great chief Quanah Parker on horseback with his lance. I also took the Welsh poet Tony Curtis's brief, funny and illuminating My Life With Dylan Thomas: ""Dylan was the mountain you had either to climb or bypass; tunnelling through him left you in the dark."" Robert Peston BBC economics editor I am not taking Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century with me, because it has been spoiled by all the blooming polemics I've read about it, and it's so enormous it will break the luggage allowance on the flight. Also I am currently bingeing on fiction, so will take Phil Klay's Redeployment and David Grossman's Falling Out of Time. Klay is a sort of Wilfred Owen of the last Iraq war. And Grossman is the poet of grief. Eliot's Middlemarch will come too, as it has on many holidays. This time it will be read. Philip French Former Observer film critic No books to be carried to exotic places. This is staycation time: what the government in the austere 1940s persuaded us to call ""holidays at home"". In my case it's been 10 woozy, pill-popping days in hospital having a knee replacement (with Geoffrey Grigson's great, final anthology The Faber Book of Reflective Verse to carry me away from groaning 3am wards to tranquil places in the mind) followed by weeks with physios, crutches, Zimmer frames, sticks, rollators and oxygen. My chief anticipated reading is The Unexpected Professor, the autobiography of my esteemed exact contemporary John Carey with a near identical CV: lower-middle-class grammar school boy, national service officer in Egypt, going up to Oxford on the same day in 1954. How differently did we play the hands we were dealt? My hitherto unread classic is Georges Simenon's enticing roman dur, The Mahé Circle, set on an island off the Côte d'Azur, published in 1944, hitherto untranslated into English. I've also dug out my 1911 Nelson's Library edition of Erskine Childers's classic espionage novel The Riddle of the Sands (bought in 1948 for a shilling) because it just matches my present condition. Its hero, perfectly named Carruthers, a self-important, upper-midle-class Foreign Office employee stuck in a hot, deserted Edwardian London summer, is suddenly dragged out of his torpor by an invitation to join a friend on a yacht in the Baltic and finds himself involved in a scheme to frustrate a German naval invasion of Great Britain across the North Sea. An enduring masterpiece with authentic nautical maps. Eben Upton Raspberry Pi inventor We are going to China on business in August and will try to tack a few days on the end to see Hong Kong when I'll be reading To Rise Again at a Decent Hour by Joshua Ferris. I'm a notorious luddite in my day-to-day use of technology, so this book about a curmudgeonly New York dentist coming to grips with a Twitter stalker sounds right up my street. The Rhesus Chart by Charles Stross. Definite beach reading: the fifth book in the Laundry Files series of spoof spy novels, it's about a secret government department charged with fighting supernatural beasties. Yes Minister meets HP Lovecraft. Finally, The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind by Julian Jaynes. Is consciousness a recent development? Did all our ancestors hear voices in their heads? This one has been lurking on my bookshelf for half a decade and I hope finally to crack it this summer. Maggie Gee Novelist I need to go to Madrid and Gibraltar for my next novel, but it will be too hot in August, so we plan to leave mobiles at home and spool around undiscovered beaches of Thanet, on trains/buses, with books and winey picnics. Bliss! I will be reading: Lyndall Gordon's Divided Lives, a follow-up memoir to her wonderful Shared Lives; Gabriel Gbadamosi's highly praised Vauxhall; and for my classic, Thackeray's Barry Lyndon – why have I never read it, given that Vanity Fair is my all-time favourite novel? Damian Barr Author I feel ashamed that I've never read Christopher and His Kind so Isherwood and I will be having some summer loving. David Nicholls's new novel, Us, is all about a family taking an epic holiday – as many emotions as air miles. I am also excited about Alex Preston's In Love and War. Pilgrimage to Dollywood: A Country Music Road Trip Through Tennessee by Helen Morale promises to be a double delight. Marina Warner Author I'm chairing the Man Booker international prize 2015, so there are heaps of novels I'd love to recommend or waiting to be read, but I mustn't tell. Sticking to other genres, the artist Marion Coutts has written a fierce love letter-cum-elegy in The Iceberg for Tom Lubbock, the artist and art critic who died three years ago. This is far more than just another book about grief. Sandra M Gilbert has found a funny, lively literary topic in The Culinary Imagination, about every kind of meal in every kind of story. Giuliana Bruno's book Surface: Matters of Aesthetics, Materiality and Media is sumptuous, irresistible: it begins with Fortuny fluted silk and closes with Sally Potter's filmed colours and textures. The Poetry of Derek Walcott, selected by Glyn Maxwell, displays magnificently the poet's lyric dynamism and invention, sustained over 50 years in an endless play of breeze, sea and sky. I've just become a grandmother so I'm fascinated by Andrea Brady's poem-essay Mutability, in which she's forging a new way of thinking about the mutual absorption of mother and infant – before the child finds language for herself. David Constantine has just turned 70 and his new collection, Elder, has a beguiling archaic goddess on the cover and many dreams and adventures inside. As for a classic, I'm looking forward to Albert Cossery's 1945 novel, Laziness in the Fertile Valley. Mariella Frostrup Observer columnist and radio/TV host As presenter of Radio 4's Open Book, I'm never short of reading material but part of the pleasure of summer holidays is turning to the books I want to read. To improve my agony aunt skills this summer, when we'll be taking a staycation in Somerset and Dorset so we can finally finish our house, I'm devoting myself to self-improvement with a cluster of the many new books blessedly free of American psychobabble. What better way to start than by unblocking the paths to true inspiration with Creativity, Inc by Ed Catmull. Next is Ruby Wax's Sane New World, offering help in everyday mindfulness and finally, what wouldn't be nice about Hardwiring Happiness? Rick Hanson promises to help me achieve that goal. The trick to achieving Gravitas, according to its author, Caroline Goyder, is to ""fake yourself under pressure"", which I'll also be learning more about. If I get through them all by autumn I'll be practically perfect and ready to start afresh on my Observer column readers! Robert Macfarlane Author and academic I'll be in Trieste and Ljubljana in the late summer and plan to read Adam Nicolson's The Mighty Dead: Why Homer Matters; and to feed my deep-running genre-fiction habit with the new Philip Kerr, A Man Without Breath. Like half a million other people, I'm much looking forward to David Mitchell's The Bone Clocks. And I plan to return to VS Naipaul's The Enigma of Arrival (1987), as a means of seeing the English landscape from the outside. Viv Albertine Musician and writer I'm going to Iceland this summer with my 15-year-old daughter. Sounds a bit odd, but I don't like the sun and nor does she. I keep checking the weather conditions in Reykjavik on my phone and when it says ""rainy and cold"" I think, Yay! The relief of not having to buy a bikini is massive. I'll take four books. First is Any Other Mouth by Anneliese Mackintosh, which I picked up recently in a bookshop in Manchester. It was written by a girl who used to work in the shop and she sounded like my kind of person. Then there's Dark Places by Gillian Flynn. I loved her Gone Girl. I'll take John Green's The Fault in Our Stars too. I'm very interested in contemporary young adult fiction, and this book is a huge hit with my daughter and her friends. Finally, I always take a self-help book away and Richard Bode's First You Have to Row a Little Boat is so elegantly written. Rachel Cooke Observer writer and author I've been saving up two novels for my holiday (in the south of France): Akhil Sharma's Family Life and Mona Simpson's Casebook. They'll make a good pair: both take a child's view of the world; both are about families coming apart at the seams. I'll also be taking Bricks &amp; Mortals: Ten Great Buildings and the People They Made by Tom Wilkinson; I'm especially looking forward to the chapter on Lubetkin's Finsbury health centre, which is close to where I live. A classic I've always meant to read is After Claude by Iris Owens, which was first published in 1973 and is the story of a break-up. Kenneth Tynan called it ""barbed, bitchy and hilariously sour"", which is good enough for me. Rachel Joyce Novelist This summer, I'm going to return with my family to Embleton Bay in Northumberland. We discovered it when I was researching my new book. It's a vast arc of a white-sanded bay with views towards Dunstanburgh Castle and I can't wait to walk alongside the rock pools at 6am and pretend for a moment that it's mine. I will take Life After Life by Kate Atkinson and Meadowland by John Lewis-Stempel. A friend gave me a copy of Middlemarch, which I haven't read since I was a teenager. Lara Feigel Writer and lecturer I've begun my summer reading with Hermione Eyre's novel Viper Wine, a stylishly exuberant true story of the 17th-century beauty Venetia Stanley succumbing to potions to stave off the loss of youth. It's an oddly haunting book, unlike any other historical novel I've come across. For my summer holiday (in Cornwall, with a bucket and spade), I'll be packing Ruth Padel's new poetry collection, Learning to Make an Oud in Nazareth and Rebecca West's A Train of Powder. Both West and Padel lead us to see political conflicts freshly by observing them through a wonderfully precise and very intimate lens. Kate Kellaway Observer writer At the front of the summer queue is Akhil Sharma's Family Life – said to have been prodigiously long in its earliest drafts but now a short, semi-autobiographical novel about a Dehli family in New York and the tragedy that overtakes young Ajay's life. Also The Shock of the Fall, a first novel about a schizophrenic by psychiatric nurse Nathan Flier (a Costa prize winner). And then, to offset what might otherwise be a desolation overdose, Angela Carter's Wise Children, about south London thespians. I'm cheating here, actually, because I've already started it and her high-kicking prose is sublime. Geoff Dyer Author No plans to go anywhere but I am looking forward to Jenny Offill's slender and smart new novel Dept of Speculation and moving on to volume three – Boyhood Island – of Karl Ove Knausgaard's My Struggle sextet. I'll also be finishing Isabel Wilkerson's The Warmth of Other Suns, her magnificent history of the great migration of African Americans from the segregated south to the democratic promise – and challenges – of the urban north. Christos Tsiolkas Novelist I am spending summer in Europe this year, in Greece and in France. I am working with a terrific photographer, Zoe Ali, on a collaboration called A Boy, a Girl and a Gun. Apart from that, I am also reading and researching for a new book. What will I be reading? Plato, Petronius's Satyricon, David Malouf's Ransom and the letters of St Paul. I am eager to begin Olivier Assayas, a collection of essays on the film-maker, edited by Kent Jones. And I am very much enjoying reading Sexual Life in Ancient Greece, a deliriously passionate and proto-queer ode to antiquity, written by Hans Licht, first published in Germany, in the 1920s. Louise Doughty Novelist We have booked an apartment on a beach in Corsica; water sports for the boy, sun lounger for me. I've been reading a lot of non-fiction as research recently so it's going to be novels all the way. Harriet Lane's Her, along with Jean Hanff Korelitz's You Should Have Known and, according to my resolution to read more fiction in translation, Summer House With Swimming Pool by Herman Koch. I would also like to catch up with the Caribbean writer Kerry Young, having recently seen her read from Gloria, the sequel to Pao. As for a classic, I've never read In a Glass Darkly by Sheridan Le Fanu. Jess Walter Novelist This summer, at Pajaro Dunes in northern California, I'm planning to read We Are Called to Rise by Laura McBride, because my wife says it's gorgeous and devastating. McBride is from my hometown, Spokane, Washington, which spits out writers like sunflower seeds. I'm also planning to read Tom Rachman's The Rise &amp; Fall of Great Powers. His first novel, The Imperfectionists, was so good. John Gray Philosopher The classic I'm taking on holiday to New York is one that's been almost forgotten – Richard Hughes's A High Wind in Jamaica. First published in 1929, it's a surreal novel of childhood adventure that turns how we see the human mind upside down. From recent fiction, I'm taking another book that questions what it means to be human: Michel Faber's Under the Skin, the brilliant and unsettling novel that inspired Jonathan Glazer's astonishing film. My non-fiction choice is Adam Phillips's Becoming Freud, for its wonderful epilogue on Freud's original sin, and much else. Alex Preston Novelist Three weeks in Puglia will allow me to give full rein to my Italo Calvino obsession. Invisible Cities and Cosmicomics are the collections coming with me, but I'd read his shopping lists I love him so much. I'm also putting together a reading list for the MA in creative writing I teach in Paris. So, sticking on the Oulipo vibe, I'll be reading Perec's Things and rereading his astonishing Life: A User's Manual, one of my favourite novels. My wife is taking two of the hottest debuts of the year – Zia Haider Rahman's In the Light of What We Know and Hermione Eyre's Viper Wine. When I run out of reading material, I'll steal them from her as they both blew my socks off. Elizabeth Day Observer writer and novelist I'm looking forward to a week in southern Spain in the company of Remember Me Like This by Bret Anthony Johnston. It has a fascinating fictional premise: a missing child who comes back and a changed family who have to get used to the idea. I've dipped into it already and the writing is clear and beautiful. Besides, a novel that comes with effusive quotes from John Irving and Alice Sebold has to be pretty good. I'll also be packing The Good Soldier by Ford Madox Ford. Despite a long-standing interest in novels written just after the first world war, to my shame I've never read it. Sara Wheeler Travel writer and biographer I'm looking forward to Vanora Bennett's new novel The White Russian, as it sounds so exotic, set among the Russian emigré community in 1930s Paris. There is also a plump classic in my suitcase – Pushkin's Complete Prose Tales, in Gillon Aitken's translation. Is he going to be as good as Chekhov? As I am going to be somewhere off the coast of Maine, I am taking Ann Hood's latest novel, The Obituary Writer. Some years ago, I much enjoyed her debut – Somewhere Off the Coast of Maine. Julie Myerson Novelist I'm going to be in Suffolk and I can't wait to read Thunderstruck, Elizabeth McCracken's new short stories – I've just finished her brilliant memoir, An Exact Replica of a Figment of My Imagination, and want more of her direct, funny and heart-stoppingly honest take on things. Having failed to get into Herman Koch's The Dinner, I'm going to give him one more chance with Summer House With Swimming Pool – partly because I like the title and partly because one of my favourite authors, David Vann, is recommending it. Also on Vann's recommendation, I'm determined finally to read Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian. Both had better be good or I'm never listening to him again. Julian Fellowes Screenwriter and novelist We're off to a villa on the Amalfi Coast this year and my plan is to lie flat with a book and a glass of something cheerful balanced on my stomach. I shall take Josephine, the new biography of Napoleon's empress by Kate Williams. I love the whole concept of accidental greatness and here we have an uneducated girl from Martinique who found herself at the centre of European affairs. My classic would be Kipps: The Story of a Simple Soul by HG Wells. Wells is not much credited with a sense of humour, but Kipps is full of warmth. It is also a wonderfully perceptive analysis of British society at the time, which seems remarkably un-different from our own. Finally, I have recently discovered They Were Counted by Miklos Banffy. It is an account of the last years of the Habsburg empire, a gently lyrical, romantic tribute to the strengths and weaknesses of that intense time, when the sun inexorably set on the old aristocratic values for ever. Stephanie Merritt Observer writer and novelist I'm walking from coast to coast (a 200-mile route from Cumbria to Yorkshire) so I'm taking Rebecca Solnit's thoughtful and fascinating Wanderlust: A History of Walking to inspire me. I'm also taking Tana French's new novel, The Secret Place – she's a seriously talented writer and I love her Dublin Murder Squad series. I've been eagerly awaiting this one for ages. Justin Cartwright Novelist For the beach at Hydra, where I am heading, I am looking forward very much to reading A Place in the Country by WG Sebald. I revere him and his unique style. Also on my list would be The Brief and Frightening Reign of Phil by George Saunders (right). If you haven't discovered Saunders, get on to him immediately: he is a genius. The last book of his I read was his short story collection Tenth of December; he deservedly won the Folio prize a few months ago. Recently, I read The Uses and Abuses of History by Margaret MacMillan, a Canadian who is warden of St Antony's College, Oxford. Reading it has made me eager to find a week or so to read her magisterial book, The War That Ended Peace, apparently the definitive account of the Great War. I also want to read The Idiot by Fyodor Dostoevsky, which somehow I have missed. Salley Vickers Novelist I shall be taking John Burnside's latest poetry collection All One Breath, Nicola Barker's novel In the Approaches and Beowulf on my regular summer retreat to my old colleague Anthony Steven's beautiful old farmhouse in Corfu. Burnside is our most exciting living poet and I love his shrewd and delicate psychological observation, and Nicola Barker is a writer I admire because I could never write like her, yet we share a similarly subversive view of life. Her latest novel boldly takes a religious theme, a subject for which I am also known, but I bet she does it differently and with style. Finally, Beowulf, which I lazily ducked as an undergraduate; an omission I have been meaning to repair for some time. Frank Cottrell Boyce Screenwriter and novelist I'll be spending Summer in Sligo and lovely Dumfries and Galloway. The book I'll be reading aloud to anyone who comes to visit is Jon Klassen's utterly brilliant This is Not My Hat – a submarine tale of hubris and death (spoiler alert). All great picture books – Where the Wild Things Are, The Tiger Who Came to Tea, The Gruffalo – have their moments of darkness. But nothing as dark as the ending of this masterpiece. It has the world's funniest ever drawing of a crab pointing. I'm also taking Clive James's translation of The Divine Comedy. It's got an urgent clarity that makes you want to give it your full attention. Robert McCrum Observer writer My summer classic is a short book I hope will distract from airport hassles. I recently saw Brian Friel's adaptation of Turgenev's Fathers and Sons in a wonderful Donmar production. But I've never read the novel and will take the Penguin edition with me on my travels to Turkey. By contrast, as an injection of contemporary financial savvy, I'll also take Flashboys by Michael Lewis. No one writes better about the cutting edge of American life. Finally, to unwind, watching the sun sink over the sea, I'll travel with Homecoming by Susie Steiner, a name to watch. Joe Dunthorne Novelist I take extra pleasure in books that are not yet available to the public so I intend to read the uncorrected proof of Ben Lerner's second novel, 10:04. I'm also going to read PG Wodehouse's Jeeves Takes Charge. Line for line, no other author brings me as much happiness. Charlie Higson Author and comedian I do question the sanity of flying halfway round the world to sit in the shade reading a book, but I suppose these days time is the ultimate luxury. I don't want to be challenged on holiday. I want the familiar. We always go to our house in Italy and I always read at least one Bernard Cornwell. I'm working my way through his Sharpe novels and am up to Sharpe's Revenge. Sunshine, beautiful women, bloody battles. Bliss. I recently discovered Robert Aickman's short stories, which are somewhere between Kafka and MR James via David Lynch, and am very pleased that Faber and Faber is republishing all his books. I'm taking Dark Entries. It's advisable to take a thick book that you can get lost in and a few people have recommended The Luminaries by Eleanor Catton, so I'm going to give it a go. If it doesn't work out, I'll use it as a float. Josie Rourke Theatre director For me, holidays are all about lying around reading. I shall be lounging in La Rochelle on a bed of paperbacks and French cheese. I am looking forward to Rachel Holmes's excellent Eleanor Marx: A Life. I loved her The Hottentot Venus and she is a biographer with a sense of adventure that carries the reader along. My next directing project is a film noir musical, City of Angels, so there will be some work brushing up my Raymond Chandlers and Dashiell Hammetts. Kamila Shamsie's new novel, A God in Every Stone, is my special treat. Julian Baggini Writer and philosopher The fact that I can't tell you exactly what Philology means – and I bet not many others can either – makes James Turner's book of the same name an intriguing prospect. I'm keen to find out more about the one-time ""queen of the human sciences"" and how she was deposed. Nothing Holds Back the Night by Delphine de Vigan is about a woman who is convinced she is telepathic and converses with Lacan. Ideal for avoiding the beach. And maybe this will be the summer when I very belatedly get through George Orwell's Essays. Scroobius Pip Spoken-word artist Sadly, I don't get holidays – I am always touring. This summer I will be going to Glastonbury, Bestival, Latitude and Godiva, and I will be taking Tape by Steven Camden. His spoken-word pieces have been a massive inspiration so I can't wait to see how his style translates to paper. Jodi Ann Bickley is another whose spoken-word stories have inspired and One Million Lovely Letters, a true-life tale, is worthy of the coverage it has received. Finally, Kerouac's On the Road. It's a book I have had since I was a teen and drifted in and out of. Time to read it properly. Curtis Sittenfeld Novelist I'm really looking forward to reading the debut novel The Year She Left Us by Kathryn Ma, which is about several generations of Chinese-American women; I've loved Ma's short stories. I'm also intrigued by Lily King's novel Euphoria, which is about a Margaret Mead-like anthropologist in 1930s New Guinea. Finally, and rather shamefully, I've never read Middlemarch, so I want to tackle that and follow it up with Rebecca Mead's literary memoir, The Road to Middlemarch. I heard Mead speak recently and she was wise and delightful. I'm headed to the mountains of Colorado but only briefly, alas – not for a remotely Middlemarch-ish stretch.

117,article,sustainable-business/2014/jul/11/activists-nanoparticles-titanium-dioxide-food-dunkin-donuts,Guardian Sustainable Business,2014-07-11,Activists take aim at nanomaterials in Dunkin' Donuts,https://gu.com/p/3qpb9,,Activists take aim at nanomaterials in Dunkin' Donuts,<p>The donut giant - along with Kraft and McDonald's – faces challenges over microscopic materials in its food chain. Is this the next GMO crisis?<br></p>,900,"The activists at environmental nonprofit As You Sow want you to take another look at your breakfast doughnut. The organization recently filed a shareholder resolution asking Dunkin' Brands, the parent company of Dunkin' Donuts, to identify products that may contain nanomaterials and to prepare a report assessing the risks of using these substances in foods. Their resolution received a fair amount of support: at the company's annual general meeting in May, 18.7% of shareholders, representing $547m in investment, voted for it. Danielle Fugere, As You Sow's president, claims that it was the first such resolution to ever receive a vote. Though it did not pass, she says that she is encouraged by the support it received. ""That’s a substantial number of votes in favor, especially for a first-time resolution,"" she says. The measure was driven by recent testing sponsored by As You Sow, which found nanoparticles of titanium dioxide in the powdered sugar that coats some of the donut chain's products. An additive widely used to boost whiteness in products from toothpaste to plastic, microscopic titanium dioxide has not been conclusively proven unsafe for human consumption. Then again, As You Sow contends, there also isn't proof that it is harmless. ""Until a company can demonstrate the use of nanomaterials is safe, we’re asking companies either to not use them or to provide labels,"" says Fugere. ""It would make more sense to understand these materials before putting them in our food."" As You Sow is currently having 16 more foods tested. The result should be available later this summer, Fugere says. Differing corporate responses Nanoparticles are tiny pieces of matter measuring less than 100 billionths of a meter — one-thousandth the thickness of a sheet of newspaper — on at least one dimension. Nanotechnology is often hailed for its potential to advance medicine, environmental clean-up, energy efficiency, and even theft prevention. In food, these particles promise creamier textures, longer freshness, and more vivid colors. But Fugere and others are wary about the dangers of having customers consume particles that have not been proven safe. These worries will sound familiar to anyone who has followed the rising tide of concern about genetically modified organisms in the foodstream. But the difference with nanoparticles, Fugere says, is that use of these materials is not yet widespread. ""The concern has been to avoid what has happened with GMOs, where you’ve got something that becomes part of the food system that's very difficult to remove,"" she says. In a statement, Dunkin' Donuts argues that the titanium dioxide identified by As You Sow does not qualify as a nanomaterial according to European Union rules or draft US Food and Drug Administration regulations. The company also points out that there is no agreed-upon standard method for identifying nanoparticles in food. ""Dunkin’ Brands continues to monitor research being conducted on nanomaterials, and we are actively engaged in discussions on the topic with our suppliers and leading researchers in the field,"" the statement claims. In 2008, As You Sow filed nanomaterial labeling resolutions with McDonald's and Kraft Foods. In response, McDonald's released a statement declaring that it does not support the use of nanomaterials in its food, packaging or toys. Kraft responded that it would make sure to address health and safety concerns before ever using nanomaterials in its products. Inconclusive studies In some studies of nanoscale titanium dioxide, ""it has been shown to exhibit toxicity in cell cultures and in animals at high doses,"" says Geoffrey Bothun, director of the Rhode Island Consortium for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology. Those results, however, don't necessarily mean that the additive poses a threat to humans. As Bothun points out, ""I don't believe humans would be exposed to such doses in their food products."" Other studies have raised concerns about the safety of some nanomaterials. Research recently conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University's Center for Nanotechnology and Nanotoxicology suggests that some nanoparticles could cause significant damage to DNA. Another study by researchers at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis indicates that carbon nanoparticles can have an adverse impact on kidney cells. Part of the problem is that nanoparticles are a relatively recent addition to the food stream. ""I don't think the long term studies have been conducted, [so] we cannot yet draw concrete conclusions,"" Bothun explains. Nanotechnology's small size, the very feature that makes it so potentially powerful, might also be what makes it hazardous, the thinking goes. Materials that tiny may be able to move through and affect the human body in ways that larger particles of the same substance do not. Research into nanomaterials by academia, industry, and the government is ongoing and widespread, Bothun says. The field is a large one, encompassing many different materials, and it is therefore difficult to make any generalizations about the safety of nanoparticles for humans, he says. ""Consumers should be aware of if and how nanomaterials are currently used in their foods, but not overly concerned about problematic nanomaterials,"" he says. ""The issue is that in some cases we don't know if a nanomaterial is problematic because the long-term research hasn't been conducted.""

118,article,sustainable-business/2014/jun/10/genetically-modified-foods-health-benefits-soybean-potatoes,Guardian Sustainable Business,2014-06-10,GMO 2.0: genetically modified foods with added health benefits,https://gu.com/p/3q227,,GMO 2.0: genetically modified foods with added health benefits,"<p>New  genetically engineered products have been designed to be healthier and save waste, but the technology cannot be imposed on people who don't want it</p>",922,"It’s easy to understand why many Americans are unenthusiastic about genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Although supermarket aisles are lined with foods made from biotech crops – most cereals, frozen foods, canned soups, vegetable oils, soft drinks, baby formula, tofu and even milk contain GMOs – consumers have yet to see tangible benefits from GMOs. The biotech industry has been slow to develop food that is healthier, better tasting or longer lasting – to its political detriment. As Food and Water Watch, a critic of GMOs, has argued, hyperbolically: “The only ones experiencing any benefits from GE crops are the few, massive corporations that are controlling the food system at every step and seeing large profit margins.” That is about to change. Pioneer, the big seed company owned by DuPont, is bringing to the market a brand of genetically engineered soybean called Plenish that the company says will produce a healthier oil, free of transfats. Plenish oils have been designed to replace the unhealthy partially hydrogenated oils used to fry food and to keep cookies and crackers, crackers and chips from going stale. Meantime, the JR Simplot Co, the US’s biggest potato processor, is seeking regulatory approval for genetically engineered potatoes branded as Innate. Simplot says the Innate potatoes will limit black spots from bruising, deliver improved taste and reduce the formation of acrylamide, a naturally occurring chemical that has been identified as a potential carcinogen and is created when potatoes are cooked at high temperatures. You can think of these new products as GMOs 2.0 – biotech foods designed not just for farmers but for consumers, too. Other examples include the Arctic Apple, which like the Innate potato is engineered not to go brown, and a soybean oil enriched with Omega-3 fatty acids from Monsanto. Russ Sanders, the director of food and industry markets for Pioneer, says of Plenish: “We’ve had folks ask us, ‘Why didn’t the industry get started with a biotech product like this?’ We think it’s a great opportunity to help illustrate the positive aspects of biotech that go beyond farmer benefits.” Pioneer researchers will continue to look at “what we can do to improve products, not just to make more of them,” Sanders told me. Haven Baker, the vice-president and general manager of Simplot Plant Sciences, says eliminating “black spot bruise” from potatoes will help curb food waste, thus saving consumers’ money. “On the fresh market alone, we estimate that there is 400m pounds of waste annually due to black spot bruise,” Baker says. Fresh potatoes account for about 40% of industry sales, with frozen and chips making up most of the rest. In part because GMOs remain controversial, neither Pioneer nor Simplot are ready to market the stories of Plenish oils or Innate potatoes to consumers. Pioneer will say that it is working with major soybean processors, including ADM, Bunge, Cargill and Perdue AgriBusiness Inc, to produce Plenish oil. But the company and its processors have yet to to identify retailers, restaurants or consumer brands that will use the oil, with a handful of exceptions – a restaurant called Trostel’s Greenbriar, near Pioneer’s headquarters in Johnston, Iowa, and an American Legion fish fry in Henry County, Ohio, near where Plenish soybeans are grown. To no one’s surprise, GMO critics say the new foods haven’t been sufficiently tested by regulators. “Humans should not have to serve as the guinea pigs for this technology,” says Genna Reed, a researcher with Food and Water Watch, which has asked McDonald’s not to use genetically engineered potatoes. A coalition of nonprofits and businesses has petitioned the US Food and Drug Administration to require labeling of all foods containing GMOs. McDonald’s is an obvious customer for Plenish oil and Innate potatoes but neither the fast-food giant nor its suppliers are ready to talk about the future of its fabled French fries. “The Simplot company has had a long relationship with McDonald’s, and that’s probably about all I can say at this time,” says Simplot’s Haven Baker (see McDonald’s GMO Dilemma). In any event, the first crops of Innate potatoes, which will be grown in 2015 if all goes according to plan, will likely be targeted for the fresh potato market, Baker said. While DuPont has poured millions into campaigns to oppose GMO labeling, the company and its allies in the soybean industry now want to spread the word about Plenish. Plenish could help soybean farmers recapture sales that were lost to canola and palm oil as concerns over transfats have grown. ""Soybean oil went from about 80% of the food-oil market to something approaching 59%,"" Pioneer’s Sanders said. For Plenish and Innate to succeed in the marketplace, they will have to deliver benefits to farmers, processors, brands, retailers and consumers – all of whom have access to competing products. Soybean farmers, for example, will be paid extra for growing Plenish soybeans. And if the Innate potatoes fail to reduce waste, there will be little reason for potato farmers to buy them, since they will sell at a slight premium to conventional seed. That’s why the rhetoric about the big seed companies “controlling the food system” doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. Whatever you think about biotech crops – and there are legitimate questions about their environmental impact, and the rights of consumers to know what they are eating, and intellectual property issues – this technology simply can’t be shoved down the throats of people who don’t want it.

119,article,environment/2014/jun/05/gm-crop-bangladesh-bt-brinjal,Environment,2014-06-05,"Bangladeshi farmers caught in row over $600,000 GM aubergine trial",https://gu.com/p/3pz7d,News,"Bangladeshi farmers caught in row over $600,000 GM aubergine trial",Activists criticise pioneering pilot scheme to grow genetically-modified aubergines backed by USAid finance,1660,"Farmers growing a landmark genetically modified food crop in Bangladesh – Bt brinjal, or aubergine – have found themselves at the centre of a power struggle between the government and activists trying to prevent the technology getting a hold in the region. The growers say they have been subjected to intimidation and misinformation about the safety of their produce by anti-GM campaigners. But in an effort to get the crop out to farmers quickly, the Bangladeshi government agency behind the project appears not to have followed some stipulations of its license to release the crops. The $600,000 (£357,920) pilot scheme – which is owned and run by a Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (Bari) with support from USAid and Cornell University – is a pivotal moment for GM technology in south Asia. Bt brinjal is southeast Asia's first GM food crop and has been brought to market after India's environment ministry imposed a moratorium on the release of a similar crop in 2010 pending further scientific scrutiny. Last May, a court in the Philippines also restricted the release of the crop citing lack of 'scientific certainty' on health and ecological safety. ""Activists and many others are fighting over these farmers to try to get them to say what is most convenient to their viewpoint,"" said Mark Lynas, communications adviser to the Bt brinjal project. ""The powerful anti-GMO lobby knows that if Bangladeshi farmers successfully adopt this new crop, other GMO crops in the pipeline such as golden rice (also being developed in Bangladesh) will be advantaged and their cause of banning the technology permanently will be harmed,"" he wrote in a blog about the project. The country's agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury has even suggested that anti-GM activists have received kick-backs from pesticide companies that stand to lose out if the crop is adopted more widely – although she provided no evidence for the claim. The new crop – which so far has had mixed cultivation success in the pilot farms – is a domestic variety of aubergine or egg-plant (locally called brinjal) which has been genetically modified with a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis – hence Bt brinjal. The gene makes a protein that is deadly to a voracious and highly costly pest, a fruit and shoot boring caterpillar, but is harmless to humans and other animals. One big advantage, say its backers, is that farmers will not have to spray their fields with pesticide every two to three days – at a cost of between £76 and £380 per year depending on the extent of infestation. Less spraying also means environmental and health benefits with less collateral damage to wild insects and less pesticide residue on the fruit sold at market. In granting license for the crop to farmers, the Bangladesh ministry of environment stipulated that Bari must satisfy technical demands to ensure that test fields were suitable and to protect local varieties and wild plants from receiving pollen from the GM plants. One stipulation was that prior to release of the crops, the institute must, ""formulate field production planning, field biosafety management planning ... safety measures such as isolation distance management planning, border row management planning, techniques for protection of local and indigenous variety and wild plants."" But Bari's director Rafiqul Islam Mondal said that the institute did not check the fields before planting the crops. ""We did not visit the fields ourselves,"" he said. Another stipulation from the ministry was that Bt brinjal sold in market should be labelled as GM. However, in Jamalpur region the produce was sold without such labelling. Mondal said grocers do not label any of the vegetables. ""We expressed our reservation to the ministry when this [gazette] was issued,"" he said. The backlash against the crop from anti-GM activists has been vehement with unsubstantiated claims that it may itself be harmful to human health and could lead to cancellation of exports of conventional brinjal crops to the EU. Of the seven farmers the Guardian visited, four had received visits at their farms from people who claimed what they were growing was dangerous to people's health and trying convince them to cease their involvement. One of those recounted a similar experience at a market where his produce was denounced as unsafe by people opposed to GM technology. ""It will pose a great danger to the farmers and consumers who will not know what they are producing and what they are eating,"" wrote Farida Akhter, a green activist and founder of Naya Krishi Andolan (New Agricultural Movement) in an op-ed in Dhaka Tribune shortly after the crop was approved for small-scale growing by the government. ""Brinjal is a very common vegetable consumed by majority of the population. So the risks are very high for the people in Bangladesh and even to the consumers in neighbouring India and those in Europe and Middle East."" There is no evidence that the crop causes any health problems in people, but Akhter says longer-term problems can't be ruled out. She accuses the government of exploiting the farmers' lack of understanding about the technology and said the farmers have only grown the crops because the government gave them free saplings. ""Farmers are not even aware of the concerns related to the GM crop,"" she said. The 20 farms in four regions of the country have become the focus of intense interest. Farmers have received frequent visits and inquiries from green activists, researchers and journalists. ""They come, take photographs of the field and leave but we don't know what they are doing with it,"" said Babul Khan, a Bt brinjal farmer in Jamalpur. Bari has tried to prevent farmers from speaking about their crops. ""I am scared to even talk to anyone about my field. I don't know what would put me into trouble,"" said Haidul Islam, 44, in Gazipur. Some of the farmers have found it difficult to sell their produce at market because of rumours that the fruit are dangerous to eat. Controversy about the project reached a new peak last month when two local newspaper articles – in the New Age and Financial Express – claimed that the crops had been a failure. A third article, in the Dhaka Tribune, claimed that Helena Paul – which it described as a ""London-based importer of vegetables"" – had written to the government in December to ""warn that the European Union would stop vegetable imports if any such genetically-modified eggplant is detected in a consignment."" Paul is in fact an anti-GM activist who had written to the government in her capacity as director of the campaign group GM freeze. The Bt brinjal project team reacted angrily to the suggestion that the technology was not working. They visited one of the farmers quoted in the Financial Express article and claim that he said two men had tried to coerce him into saying his crop had failed. The Guardian has visited or spoken to all but one of the 20 farmers growing the Bt brinjal crop and established that it has so far had mixed results. While it appears to have successfully repelled the fruit and shoot borer pest as expected, some of the fields have succumbed to other ailments including bacterial wilt and drought. Of the 19 farmers, nine said they had had problems with the crop, with a failure rate of four out of five farms in Gazipur, the region closest to Dhaka. Visits to the two farms in Jamalpur, over 124 miles north of the Bangladeshi capital, show the contrast in results. The region is a patchwork of meadows and green fields where the locals are largely farmers growing a variety of crops that are mostly trucked to the capital for sale. Ratan Miah's farm has yielded 17 maunds (traditional baskets) of the vegetable since the beginning of May – and he says the crops sold well at market. The other farm in the region, owned by Babul Khan, has yielded only three maunds and more than half of his crops have died. Akhter says that Bari should have had closer oversight over which farms were selected to grow the crops, how they were doing it and whether they were suitable. Mondal said the ""selection of the fields were wrong."" Most of the test fields had cultivated conventional brinjals previously and so they contained pathogens of bacterial wilt and fungus left over from those conventional crops, he said. But Frank Shotkoski, manager of the Agricultural Biotechnology Support Project II programme at Cornell, said that the problems with bacterial wilt was largely unavoidable. ""We and the farmers were well aware of the fact that the fields were being planted during the wet season when bacterial wilt is more prevalent … There is little that can be done to prevent or control the pathogen when conditions are conducive for infection."" Bt brinjal What is the crop? The crop is a local variety of brinjal (aubergine or eggplant) that has been genetically modified to include a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis. This gene produces the toxin cry1Ac that kills fruit and shoot boring pest when it ingests the plant. Because the plant carries it own 'pesticide' the caterpillar does not need to be controlled by repeated rounds of pesticide spraying. The toxin is harmless to humans and other animals. Who owns the crops? The Bt gene was developed by the Maharashtra Hybrid Seed Company, the Indian partner of the US seed giant Monsanto and later donated to the public sector partners in India, Bangladesh and Philippines. Bt brinjal was developed by the government-operated Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute with technical assistance from Cornell University in the US and funding from USAid. Monsanto still owns the technology but has granted a royalty-free, not-for-profit license to BARI to test, produce and distribute the plants other than by sale. Farmers will be encouraged to save seeds and use them in future. • This article was corrected on 9th June 2014. It originally stated that Monsanto had no ownership rights over the technology. That has now been corrected.",,0.03142595520421606

With your help, Karl Mathiesen investigates whether genetically modified crops will make purely organic crops impossible.</p><p>Join the debate. Post your views in the comments below, email <a href=""email:karl.mathiesen.freelance@guardian.co.uk"">karl.mathiesen.freelance@guardian.co.uk</a> or tweet <a href=""https://twitter.com/KarlMathiesen"">@karlmathiesen</a><br></p>",3254,"PS. Spare a thought too, for Steve Marsh and Michael Baxter. This was a sad and age-old story of two mates caught on opposing sides of a philosophical divide. The affair has no doubt deeply affected their small rural community. Baxter's comments about the destruction of his marriage were moving. Whatever happens, the law should be constructed so that farmers are not driven to tear one another to shreds. Most people I spoke to today agreed organic crops planted near to similar GM farms will suffer from cross-pollination. This could make it impossible for the two to coexist. GM advocates and scientists say the problem is not GM but the zero tolerance approach of organic regulators. I like Jonathan Jones' analogy with Protestants and Catholics, but maybe not for quite the same reason he does. He implies that this debate is characterised by the intolerance of organic farmers and regulators to legal GM crops. But this is not just about organic farmers' right to make a living, or GM farmers' right to grow a legal crop. This is also about consumers' right to control the food they eat. Jones is right that the regulations controlling organic produce are ideological. People hold an innate mistrust of GM. This philosophy leaves little room for the trace elements in which scientific safe levels usually deal. But there is a tendency within the science community to treat concerns over GM with scorn because it is seen as irrational. This will only reinforce the anti-GM position, rather than build confidence in the product. In the end the basis of the fears is irrelevant. The intolerance exists and, just like in religious disputes, it cuts both ways. These two comments, posted beside each another in the comments section, are a nice example of the contrasting and immovable positions that make this a Chinese finger trap of an issue. Jeremy Sweet is an independent consultant who acted as an expert witness in the Marsh v Baxter case. He says the case was ""not cut and dried"". He could understand why the judge had found that the organic body's stringent guidelines were flawed. Because Marsh was not growing any crops that could be contaminated by the GM canola from his neighbour's farm, says Sweet, ""quite frankly it had no impact on the 'organicness' of his farm"". But on the other hand, Baxter had an ethical responsibility to control the spread of his crop. Sweet said he had recommended that Baxter employ appropriate measures. Growing organic produce becomes difficult, he said, when there is potential for cross pollination. But he said the organic industry's zero tolerance was impractical and ""impossible to achieve"" alongside a GM industry. He said the organic model seemed arbitrary, noting that non-organic materials (such as copper used as a fungicide in organic farming) are commonly tolerated in organic produce at quite high levels. A response to Jonathan Jones from Soil Association policy director Peter Melchett. To which Jones has replied: Melchett fails to distinguish between breeds and brands. Of course breeds are distinct from one another. And different cheeses are based on objectively different, scientifically distinguishable, processes and strains of microbe. English sparkling wine is effectively champagne but cannot be called champagne because champagne is a brand for sparkling wine produced in a particular region, so that people who make sparkling wine in Champagne can charge more money for it. All of these are defined on the basis of what they are. In contrast, organic is defined for the most part on what it is not. I would echo the point that if the organic farmer in question had been growing rapeseed, he might have had cause to object to a neighboring GM rapeseed field if organic rules impose zero tolerance on GM admixture. Since he was growing rye and sheep, a neighboring GM rapeseed field could not possibly change any of his produce. The organic rule-makers need to rethink, and include being good neighbours among their goals. OFarm and Food and Water watch surveyed farmers, mostly from the midwest, about whether they thought it was possible to contain GM crops. Note: this is not a USDA survey as stated below. Eva Novotny, from Scientists for Global Responsibility, conducted a study that concluded it was impossible to contain pollen and therefore organic farms could not survive beside GM crops with which they might cross-pollinate. ""Wind and insects can spread pollen for miles. Even maize pollen, which is relatively heavy, was observed to contaminate a farm 3 miles away in a cross-wind direction from the source. ""Seeds can be carried by birds, animals, shoes and farm machinery. GM seeds can unintentionally be mixed with non-GM seeds during transport, storage and processing. ""Many incidents have occurred demonstrating that GM pollen and seeds cannot be contained, and no legislation can make them contained."" Mark Downs, chief executive of the Society of Biology said today: “It is important to ensure GM and non-GM crop varieties can co-exist, and this is a vital area for research and policy development. The farming practices required to minimise cross fertilisation or seeding, such as the separation distance between crops, will depend on a number of factors including accepted contamination thresholds. “It is extremely important to satisfy consumer and democratic choice in setting the acceptable levels of contamination. However, extremely tight thresholds across all crops could reduce potential opportunities to benefit from genetically modified crops. “As the Marsh case highlights, clear protocols and legislation addressing economic and environmental liability are needed. However, it would be a mistake for regulation to be excessively punitive, as this would inhibit the development of environmentally and economically beneficial GM crops and practices.” Steve Marsh pictured after the verdict. Jonathan Jones, a professor at the Sainsbury Laboratory, says organic farmers have ""created a problem for themselves"" by insisting on zero tolerance. ""Organic is a brand, it's not a real thing. The trade association makes rules that define what can and can't be organic. It's got no objective definition. It's not a scientific truth,"" he said. ""GM is just a method, it's not a thing. So I think it's nuts for people to fetishise a method."" Jones said the organic movement was purely ideological. He used an analogy in which a Protestant church complains because of incense floating across from a nearby Catholic mass because they think it is not the correct way to worship. ""It's all about people's perception of how we should farm."" Rather than ask if GM will force out organic farmers, he said, organic farmers should ask themselves if they ""are prepared to be good neighbours"". This meant relaxing restriction on organic food so that it allowed for tolerance. In Jones' estimation, Marsh should have sued Australia's organic association, rather than his neighbour, for unreasonably taking his certification. The Australian GM industry association Croplife has also called for government action to stop futher conflict between farmers. ""This decision emphasises the need for activists to stop creating unnecessary conflict between farmers and for the Australian organic industry to start seriously considering bringing their marketing rules in line with the rest of the world. ""We want to ensure that all Australian farmers have a choice to grow any approved crop on their land. No farmer should have to change their farming methods simply because of unreasonable, illogical and internationally inconsistent organic marketing rules."" It doesn't specifically mention the supposed 5% limit in the US but I'm certain this is the reference. It would seem the GM industry is (perhaps wilfully) misrepresenting international standards to influence the law in Australia. Some comments from the defendant Michael Baxter on Farm Online: “There’s no reason why I shouldn’t,” he said to Fairfax Agricultural Media. “I’m pretty relieved it’s over now after three and a bit years of waiting to arrive at this decision. “I felt I’d done nothing wrong all along and was confident the law would show that in the end which it has.” Mr Baxter said the decision wouldn’t change any of his on-farm practices “because there’s nothing wrong with GM and the court proved that”. He said Mr Marsh only found nine plants growing on his property 12 months after the GM swaths blew over from his farm. “They carried on and said it was all a huge contamination but really, only nine plants isn’t much of a problem is it?” he said. Soil Association policy director, Peter Melchett, says the case highlighted the need for a clear legal framework which should pass responsibility for damages caused by GM crops onto the seed producers, in this case Monsanto. ""Farmers shouldn't be fighting among themselves,"" says Melchett. In an area such as the EU, where farms are much smaller. ""It would be very difficult to identify the farmers responsible for a contamination."" Laws that passed responsibility to the seed companies had been proposed in Wales (which remains GM free). In Denmark, the government has tried to resolve the problem by creating a fund for organic farmers affected by GM production. All GM farmers pay into the fund, which is topped up by the government. Taxpayer contributions to this fund, says Melchett, are ""very unfair"". Melchett said the amount of GM material allowed in organic food is legislated at 0% in the US and EU. In Australia the body that temporarily stripped Marsh's certification was also strict about this zero tolerance approach. Melchett said this level was based on the organic philosophy, which allows for no GM material whatsoever. ""It is based on the principles and values [of organic food]. That's what people who buy organic food want and expect."" But the Marsh case did not set much of a precedent because he was growing crops that could not be contaminated by the GM canola grown by his neighbour, he said. He said organic farmers growing crops related to those of nearby GM farmers would have trouble keeping meeting the stringent regulations on organic foods. ""Organic farming finds it very difficult to survive... where cross pollination is difficult to avoid"". However, there are really a tiny number of GM crops in production,he said, therefore most organic farming was not under threat. Murdoch University's Michael Jones, writes in the Conversation that the judgement was ""a victory for common sense"". If the judgement had favoured Marsh it would have pitted many other farmers against their neighbours and set back the progress towards co-existence in the farming system between organic and GM growers. The reasons for activists’ anti-GM stance are almost always political and ideological, rather than scientific. This is reflected in the NASAA’s organic certification standard, which says (emphasis added): Even where evidence of GMOs is not detected in finished organic product, the deliberate or negligent exposure of organic production systems or finished products to GMOs is outside organic production principles. Zero tolerance to GM material (or other materials) is impossible to achieve, and as such the organic standards create an unrealistic situation that was bound to lead to the sort of dispute that occurred between Marsh and Baxter. That is why Justice Martin’s decision was a victory for common sense. The case was really a test of the organic certification standards, rather than of Baxter’s farming practices. The best outcome would be that the NASAA and similar organic certification organisations in Australia reassess their standards, and come into line with those already in existence overseas. The United States, for example, has a 5% tolerance threshold before organic decertification. Even Europe, where anti-GM sentiment is stronger, has a 0.9% tolerance. Jones' claim that the US has a 5% tolerance for GM material in organic food has been widely reported. But it appears to be wrong, at least in the case of the US. In fact the US and EU have even tougher controls than Australia because the tolerance level for GM in organic food is legislated at 0%. The US Department of Agriculture says: Issue: Has a tolerance level (e.g. 5%) been established for the presence of GMOs in organic agricultural products? Reply: The NOP regulations do not establish GMO tolerance levels. The NOP regulations establish a tolerance for the presence of pesticides registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that is set at 5% of the EPA tolerance level for the specific residue detected. No federal agency, including EPA or USDA has established tolerance levels for the inadvertent presence of the products of excluded methods (GMOs). Issue: Processed foods sold as “organic” must contain at least 95% organic ingredients. Are GMOs allowed in the remaining 5% of ingredients? Likewise, processed foods sold as “made with organic (specified ingredients or food group(s))” must contain at least 70% organic ingredients. Are GMOs allowed in the remaining 30% of ingredients for these products? Reply: The use of GMOs is prohibited in all ingredients in “organic” and “made with organic (specified ingredients or food groups(s)).” There is no provision within the NOP regulations that allows the use of excluded methods (GMOs) in ingredients or processing aids under the “organic” or “made with organic (specified ingredients or food group(s))” label categories. If anyone has a link to the comparable EU organic legislation I'd be very interested. This comment thread on Facebook has some interesting insights into how the Australian farming community feels about this. Miguel De Salas Gorospe: ""It's an interesting case, since Marsh was obviously not growing canola or another brassica seed crop, as he was able to readily identify the rogue GM canola plants. It is interesting that the certification body would choose to de-certify him given the zero risk of contamination of Marsh's crops, and it seems to me he would have got further suing them to change their zero tolerance policy to be in line with the rest of the world. Still I can't argue that, based on misinformation and misunderstanding or no, the Australian consumer has a pathological fear of GM, and the certification bodies only act accordingly."" Writing for the Guardian, Australian Research Council future fellow Matthew Rimmer said the ruling raised the prospect of ""biotrespass"" laws to protect organic farmers. The decision in Marsh v Baxter will no doubt reignite the debate over GM crop liability. A number of scholars have argued that there is a need to revise liability regimes in respect of biotechnology. Professor Jeremy de Beer from the University of Ottawa has argued that there is a need to adapt the legal principles of trespass to accommodate recent developments in biotechnology, nanotechnology, and synthetic biology. He has called for the creation of a cause of action for ""biotrespass"". No doubt the agricultural biotechnology industry would resist such efforts at law reform. From their perspective, GM crops should be subject to the same liability regimes as other forms of farming and agriculture. At an international level, there will be further debate over the position of GM crops in the sweeping regional agreements under negotiation – including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. There is an intense struggle between organic farmers and the biotechnology industry at a number of levels in these international agreements. The Marsh's lawyer, Mark Walter, said the case would have ramifications for Australia's organic industry and raised the possibility of appeal: ""This is a disappointing result for Mr Marsh and leaves Australia’s non-genetically modified food farmers with no legal protection against contamination from nearby properties ... We will closely examine the judgement of this complex and unique case and advise our client of his legal options, including his right to appeal."" The Safe Food Foundation, which helped bankroll Marsh's case, said the future for organic food in Australia was now ""uncertain"". The Foundation said the judge had erred by criticising Australia's organic food regulators for stripping Marsh's organic status. The court in its judgment stated the decision by NASAA (National Association of Sustainable Agriculture Australia) to decertify Steve was erroneous. Given the extent of the contamination of Steve’s farm we fail to see how NASAA could have taken any other decision. Certainly 100% of organic consumers would support the NASAA decision. Because the court did not recognise the NASAA decertification the court did not recognise the economic loss Steve suffered, and dismissed the case that Steve had brought for negligence and nuisance. Foundation director, Scott Kinnear, said: “This is a huge setback for organic and Non GM farmers and their choice to remain GM Free. This has been an important test case, of interest to many parties, locally and globally. “We also call on our legislators to work on finding a solution to this vexed issue. State and Federal governments have continuously stated that the solution to any GM contamination events is common law. This has clearly failed today and demonstrates that the law has not kept up with new technologies such as GM.” NASAA general manager Ben Copeman said the decision highlighted the need for legislative change for the sector and that it had opened up a ""Pandora box"" of conflict between the GM and organic farming sectors. “We found GM canola growing on organically certified land. The court found that there was no risk of GM contamination. While tolerance thresholds for GM contamination are governed by the Federal Government under the National Standard for Organic and Biodynamic Produce, it is not a legislated standard and is not recognised by the courts."" The Guardian reported on Wednesday: Steve Marsh was suing his neighbour and former friend Michael Baxter for $85,000 after claiming that GM canola drifted onto his oats, rye and sheep farm at Kojonup, 260km south-east of Perth. As well as financial compensation, Marsh wanted Western Australia’s supreme court to issue a permanent injunction banning Baxter from planting GM crops. But Justice Kenneth Martin came down on the side of Baxter when he delivered his judgment on Wednesday. In his 150-page judgment summary, Justice Martin said there had been no unreasonable interference with Marsh's crops and that he had only claimed for financial loss. Marsh said he lost almost 70% of his farm after his organic certification was withdrawn. ""They did not claim to have suffered any physical damage or injury to themselves, to their animals or to their land at Eagle Rest,"" the judgment said. An Australian organic farmer has been told by a judge that his neighbour cannot be held responsible for damages caused by his legally-grown crop of GM canola. Steve Marsh attempted to sue his neighbour Michael Baxter when he discovered stems of genetically modified canola growing on his organic farm. Marsh said he had lost the use of 70% of his land because of Australia's zero tolerance of GM material in organic food. Biotechnology scientist Michael Jones from Murdoch University told the Guardian that the case meant Australia would have to rethink its organic regulations as GM crops expanded across the country. “The case was really a test of the organic certification standards rather than of farming practices,” he said. “The organic certification bodies in the US have a 5% limit of GM before someone loses their organic certification, and even in the EU the limit is 0.9%. “When sensible limits are set, then organic, conventional and GM cropping can co-exist, as is the case in the USA and elsewhere.” Are tight organic standards and GM food incompatible?

The ruling in Marsh v Baxter is an enormous win for the agricultural biotechnology industry, and has disappointed organic farmers and their advocates. The dispute was between a family of organic farmers, Stephen and Susan Marsh, and their neighbour and former friend Michael Baxter. After Stephen found GM stalks and seeds on his property in 2010, he sought damages and a permanent judgment to stop Baxter swathing GM canola (slashing the crop so it ripens at a uniform rate). The Marshes were concerned about cross-contamination, and the loss of the organic certification of their nearby property, Eagle Rest. The case went back to the basics of tort law. Justice Kenneth Martin cited Lord Atkin’s classic 1932 dictum in Donoghue v Stevenson: ""The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour, and the lawyer's question, 'Who is my neighbour?' receives a restricted reply."" In an epic 150-page judgment, Martin grappled with the complex factual matrix of the case, while also showing a certain wariness at the novelty of the dispute, and the public controversy over GM crops. First, Martin concluded ""that there was no unreasonable interference by Mr Baxter with the Marshes' enjoyment of Eagle Rest merely by his growing RR canola on Sevenoaks during 2010"". Second, he held that Baxter's swathing wasn't ""unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment by the Marshes of Eagle Rest"" – irrespective of their organic certification and the contracts that relied upon it. Third, the Marshes' action in negligence also failed, in part because of the novelty of the case led to ""the absence of a duty of care to avoid a foreseeable economic loss"". Finally, the judge rejected the claim for a permanent injunction to stop Baxter swathing in the future, because of ""the absence of an empirical basis to support any buffer distance"". Martin's decision will prompt much debate, especially given the factually-specific nature of the dispute. The decision of the supreme court of Western Australia follows unsuccessful cases by organic farmers in Canada and the United States against biotechnology companies. Marsh's lawyers were understandably disheartened by the judgment. Mark Walter of Slater and Gordon raised the possibility of appeal: ""This is a disappointing result for Mr Marsh and leaves Australia’s non-genetically modified food farmers with no legal protection against contamination from nearby properties ... We will closely examine the judgement of this complex and unique case and advise our client of his legal options, including his right to appeal."" The national association for sustainable agriculture, Australia (NASAA), the organisation that certifies organic farms, was also far from triumphant. ""This case has implications for organic, conventional and GM production in Australia and internationally,"" they said in a statement. ""We welcome the debate this case has generated on how organic and non-organic farmers can co-exist while respecting each other’s right to farm in the way they choose"". NASAA added that the dispute ""has also generated debate on the national standards for organic certification and how these standards should be applied"". Greens MLC Lyn McLaren was less circumspect, saying the case ""failed a fairness test"" and was ""a saddening result for Steve Marsh and non-GMO farmers holding their breath in hopes of a defence against Monsanto"". While the critics of genetically modified crops were disappointed by the decision, the agricultural biotechnology industry was jubilant. Matthew Cossey, chief executive of CropLife Australia, said the decision was a ""victory for common-sense and confirms the long standing tradition of coexistence of all farming methods"". The decision in Marsh v Baxter will no doubt reignite the debate over GM crop liability. A number of scholars have argued that there is a need to revise liability regimes in respect of biotechnology. professor Jeremy de Beer from the University of Ottawa has argued that there is a need to adapt the legal principles of trespass to accommodate recent developments in biotechnology, nanotechnology, and synthetic biology.

At an international level, there will be further debate over the position of GM crops in the sweeping regional agreements under negotiation – including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. There is an intense struggle between organic farmers and the biotechnology industry at a number of levels in these international agreements – including in respect of intellectual property, GM crop liability, GM crop labelling, and regulation of biotechnology. It remains to be seen whether such international agreements will harmonise the regulation of agricultural biotechnology in the Pacific Rim, and across the Atlantic.",,0.00380405035577449

An 11-day hearing in February was told that Roundup Ready (RR) canola swathes by US company Monsanto, were harmless to animals, people and land even if consumed. ""GM canola only posed a risk of transferring genetic material if a canola seed germinated in the Eagles Rest soil ... and then later cross-fertilised through its pollen being exchanged with another compatible species,"" Justice Martin said. ""There was no evidence at the trial of any genetic transference risks posed by the RR canola swathes blown into Eagle Rest at the end of 2010. The Marshes had never grown canola upon Eagle Rest."" He said it had not been shown there had been ""any reasonable interference"" by Baxter, who he said had used well-accepted harvest methodology. ""Mr Baxter was not to be held responsible as a broadacre farmer merely for growing a lawful GM crop and choosing to adopt a harvest methodology (swathing), which was entirely orthodox in its implementation,"" he said. ""Nor could Mr Baxter be held responsible, in law, for the reactions to the incursion of the Marshes' organic certification body, NCO, which in the circumstances presented to be an unjustifiable reaction to what occurred."" Speaking outside the court, Baxter said the protracted court case had destroyed his life. ""It has been a real tough three-and-a-half years,"" he said. ""My marriage has fallen apart – I just want to get back to normal. You don't expect your neighbour to sue you."" The Western Australian Greens MP, Lynn MacLaren, was scathing of the result. ""WA laws have failed a fairness test today,"" she told the Guardian. “This is a saddening result for Steve Marsh and non-GMO farmer holding their breath in hopes of defence against Monsanto. “It is clear GM farming cannot exist with organic farming when voluntary regulation practices are ignored. “What we have seen is this court case is an undeniable dismissal of voluntary regulations that could have prevented the contamination of Steve Marsh’s crop. “This judgment comes at great cost to the Marsh family and non-GMO farmers everywhere.” WA Pastoral and Graziers Association director John Snooke welcomed the court’s decision, saying there were more than 1,000 GM farmers in WA. “They are embracing the new technology,” he said. Julie Newman from the National Network of Concerned Farmers, said Marsh would appeal the decision in the high court. “This should have never been farmer against farmer, the government should have sorted the issue out,” she said. “If you lose part of your crop through spray drift you get compensation. “When GM crops contaminate your crop you get nothing. “This is ridiculous.”",,-0.007528619528619528
123,article,sustainable-business/vermont-gmo-labeling-law-genetically-modified-foods-lawsuits,Guardian Sustainable Business,2014-05-08,Vermont takes on genetically modified foods,https://gu.com/p/3p3np,,Vermont takes on genetically modified foods with new labeling law,A bill - which the governor is expected to sign into law Thursday - would make the state the first to require labeling for products with GMO ingredients. But will it ever take effect?,1003,"Vermont governor Peter Shumlin is expected to sign the United States' first unrestricted GMO labeling law today. The new law (pdf), scheduled to take effect in July 2016, will be the first in the nation to require food makers to label products made from genetically modified ingredients, such as corn, soybean or sugar beets. GMO-labeling advocates have been rejoicing at the news, but trade groups and some scientists have been more skeptical. Others, including Vermont's Attorney General Bill Sorrell, are bracing for industry-led lawsuits they say are very likely to follow. Connecticut and Maine have also passed GMO-labeling laws, but both states included trigger clauses in the language. Connecticut, for example, doesn't take effect until four other states, with a total of at least 20 million residents, enact similar laws. Maine's law won't take effect until five nearby states follow suit. High-profile ballot measures to enact labeling laws failed in California in 2012 and Washington state in 2013. But activity is percolating around the country. The Center for Food Safety says there are currently 63 active GMO labeling bills in 23 states, and 32 bills have been introduced since the beginning of this year. But for now, Vermont is going solo. 'The right to know' State representative Paul Ralston, a Democrat from Middlebury, voted in favor of the bill, but says his vote wasn't determined by the heated controversies that surround genetically modified crops, including potential health concerns - which some dismiss groundless - or the emergence of superweeds. ""I just don't have the scientific background to understand the complexity of the issue and don't really need to. I represent the people, and their will was made overwhelmingly clear,"" he says. ""It's a basic principle of the right to know. That's the primary reason."" The new law will require food makers to label products that contain genetically modified ingredients with phrases such as ""partially produced with genetic engineering"", ""may be produced with genetic engineering"" or ""produced with genetic engineering"". Meat, alcohol and meals prepared in restaurants will be exempt. Dairy also will receive a temporary labeling pass pending further study by the state's attorney general. And products that contain genetically modified ingredients cannot be marketed as ""all natural"" – a food-industry practice that's already being challenged in the courts. ""Companies shouldn't be able to do an end run by slapping a ""natural"" label on a product that contains GMOs as, unfortunately, they are allowed to do today,"" says Urvashi Rangan, executive director of the Consumer Reports Food Safety and Sustainability Center. ""Leave it to the state of Vermont to pick up where the FDA has left off when it comes to defining natural."" Challenges could block the law With just over 625,000 residents in the state, speculation abounds that companies such as PepsiCo, Coca Cola, General Mills, Nestle and Kraft – who oppose GMO labeling efforts – could simply stop stocking shelves in Vermont instead of complying with the new law. The Grocery Manufacturers Association, which calls Vermont's labeling bill critically flawed and bad for consumers, declined to comment or grant an interview. According to a statement released by the group: ""It sets the nation on a costly and misguided path toward a 50-state patchwork of GMO labeling policies that will do nothing to advance the safety of consumers"". Hannaford, a grocery chain with stores in Vermont, and yogurt maker Stonyfield Farm also didn't respond to requests for comment. If Vermont's law isn't smacked down over a lawsuit based on a First Amendment challenge (pdf) or one over interference of interstate commerce, it could be smothered another way. Earlier this month, US Representative Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas, introduced federal legislation that would nullify state GMO-labeling laws, including Vermont's. Pompeo has since lined up four co-sponsors of The Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2014, including representatives G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina, Jim Matheson of Utah, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Ed Whitfield of Kentucky. ""It's a preemption bill that would not allow states to enact labeling of GE foods,"" explains Rebecca Spector, west coast director of the Center for Food Safety, which helped write the Vermont bill. ""Because the FDA has refused to label genetically engineered foods, states have the right to take this action on their own, and the Pompeo bill would preempt that."" A view from Ben &amp; Jerry's Opponents of GMO labeling laws say genetically engineered foods are safe, and say laws that would require labeling would increase the cost of foods to consumers. But Jerry Greenfield, co-founder of iconic Vermont ice cream company Ben &amp; Jerry's, disagrees. Products made for the company's European customers are already non-GMO, and by the end of 2014, all Ben &amp; Jerry products will be sourced from non-GMO ingredients. ""It's not an easy thing to do, but it's not an impossible thing to do,"" Greenfield tells The Guardian. ""We're doing it using the same suppliers, without raising prices to the consumers."" Ben &amp; Jerry's took some heat after its parent company, Unilever, donated $467,000 to defeat California's ballot measure two years ago. At the time, Greenfield says Ben &amp; Jerry's ingredients were about 80% GMO-free. But the company realized that in order to get involved in other right-to-know campaigns, it needed to be transparent about its own ingredients, he says. So it came clean with customers and got to work promoting Washington state's ballot measure. ""Our corporate parent was supporting something the company wouldn't have supported. Even though Unilever doesn't agree with Ben &amp; Jerry's position, they allow us to be active,"" Greenfield says. Now that Vermont has cleared the biggest hurdle, many will turn to New York, Maryland and California, where similar bills are moving through the committees, and in Oregon, where labeling advocates are trying to get a measure on the ballot in November.

124,article,sustainable-business/walmart-jack-sinclair-agriculture-crops-sustainability,Guardian Sustainable Business,2014-05-06,"Can Walmart, 'the most important force in agriculture', become a force for green?",https://gu.com/p/3px3m,,Walmart: 'the most important force in agriculture' looking to go green,"Jack Sinclair, Walmart's grocery head, discusses the struggles to blend sustainability and low, low prices",783,"One of the most powerful people in the US food industry is a 52-year-old native of Scotland who got his start in the business stacking groceries on supermarket shelves. Today, as an executive vice-president in charge of all the grocery operations at Walmart, Jack Sinclair is still stacking shelves – albeit on a grander scale. Sinclair, who has been with Walmart since 2007, doesn't just help to decide which products will make their way onto the shelves of America's biggest retailer: he also exercises influence over how and where they are grown. In fact, joining Sinclair at a panel discussion at the National Geographic Society last week, former US agriculture secretary Dan Glickman said: ""If you ask me what is the most important force in the agriculture today, I'd point to Walmart."" It's a startling claim, but there's little doubt that Walmart's impact on food and agriculture is vast. More than half of its annual revenues, which topped $476bn last year, come from groceries, and its market share is growing. Increasingly, the retailers has shown a willingness to use its buying power to influence the way that food is grown. Last week, for example, Walmart invited the CEOs of Campbell Soup, General Mills, Kellogg and PepsiCo, among others, to its Bentonville headquarters for a sustainability summit. Several of these top food execs promised to persuade farmers in their supply chains to use less fertilizer and water to grow crops, and to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. ""One of Walmart's strengths is our convening power,"" Sinclair says. That's for sure: look at this selfie of food industry CEOs at the event. But Walmart does more than convene. Sinclair oversaw the deal that brought Wild Oats organic fare to Walmart customers, at prices said to be below those of other organic brands. He also signed an agreement with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, a worker-based human rights group, to improve pay and working conditions for Florida tomato pickers. ""We sell more food than anybody else,"" Sinclair says. ""If we don't do it in a sustainable way, we will not have the kind of future that we need."" I sat down with Sinclair last week in Washington DC to talk about Walmart's impact on food and agriculture. Here are some highlights from our conversation, and from the panel at National Geographic: On organic food: By working long-term with Wild Oats and farmers and processors in the supply chain, Walmart will be able to sell the Wild Oats brand for 25% less than other national organic brands. ""What you find when you dig into the organic movement is everything is small scale,"" Sinclair says. ""If you consolidate that, and give long term commitments, and look for efficiencies in distribution you can bring costs … Organic will be more efficient when Walmart gets involved."" Some people will criticize this as Big Organic but the upshot will be more acreage under organic cultivation. On Florida's tomato workers: The Fair Food program put forth by the tomato workers group is ""very reasonable and it gives us confidence that workers are being treated the way they ought to be treated,"" Sinclair says. Following such companies as McDonald's and Whole Foods Market, Walmart agreed to pay a penny per pound more for Florida tomatoes and support workers rights. (I didn't ask Sinclair why Walmart, which has come under intense criticism for being a low-wage employer, can't pay its own workers more.) On local food: Sourcing more food locally can save shipping costs and get produce to the shelves more quickly, Sinclair says. In Arkansas, Walmart is buying more locally-grown apples because their quality is competitive with those grown in Washington state. But as its sales volumes grow, Walmart will have to source food from everywhere. For example, the company will sell 1.1bn bananas this year and expects to sell 2bn in five years. ""However much you want to do local, you've got to sell bananas from Costa Rica,"" Sinclair says. On GMO labeling: It's unnecessary, Sinclair says, and he's right. Consumers who want to avoid eating genetically modified crops can buy organic. That's one reason why Walmart is driving down organic prices. On food costs: Again and again, Sinclair talked about the importance of keeping food prices down. This is why Walmart is eager to promote precision agriculture and more judicious use of fertilizer and to look for ways to reduce food waste – all those practices save money. About 140 million people a week buy food at Walmart and ""they can only afford what they can afford,"" Sinclair says. The supply chain hub is funded by Fairtrade Foundation.

125,article,sustainable-business/microbeads-cosmetics-gyres-plastics-pollution-makeup,Guardian Sustainable Business,2014-05-05,The microbead battle and the search for a greener replacement,https://gu.com/p/3zz2d,,Ditching microbeads: the search for sustainable skincare,"As activists push for a ban on microbeads, cosmetic companies - and consumers - search for environmentally-friendly substitutes",1625,"Is smoother skin worth more than having potable water or edible fish? For years, research has shown that beauty products made with tiny microbeads, gritty cleansers that scrub off dead skin cells, have been damaging water supplies, marine life and the ecological balance of the planet. Beat the Microbead, an international campaign to ban the plastic beads, reports that marine species are unable to distinguish between food and microbeads. According to the campaign, ""over 663 different species were negatively impacted by marine debris with approximately 11% of reported cases specifically related to the ingestion of microplastics"". To make things worse, microbeads can act like tiny sponges, absorbing several other dangerous chemicals, including pesticides and flame retardants. As they ingest microbeads, marine animals also consume these other poisons. The obvious solution to the microbead problem is to cut it off at the source. But while major cosmetic companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson, Unilever, and Procter &amp; Gamble have pledged to phase out the use of microbeads in favor of natural alternatives, they also say that the shift could take several years. And as more research is done, it appears that microbead replacements may come with dangers of their own. Putting a face on a larger pollution problem Most of the plastic pollution swirling in the ocean's five major oceanic trash vortexes has stayed out of the collective consciousness, leaving the public with an ""out of sight, out of mind"" feeling of safety. But as microbeads rinse down drains and into lakes, oceans, and rivers, they are making it much harder for citizens to ignore the threat of plastic pollution. This is becoming particularly pressing in Lake Erie, which acts as a bottleneck for all of the Great Lakes – and for the runoff from sewage treatment centers that are unable to contain the tiny plastic beads before they empty into the Saint Lawrence Seaway. 5Gyres, an organization aimed at reducing plastic ocean pollution worldwide, recently found a large number of microplastics in the Great Lakes. They estimate that one single care product, like Neutrogena's Deep Clean, contains 360,000 microbeads in a single package. Stiv Wilson, associate director for 5 Gyres, says that they discovered the Great Lakes plastic by accident. The group was looking for photo-degraded micro-plastics, similar to those found in the ocean. Instead, they found microbead concentrations of 450,000 per square kilometer in Lake Erie. ""What we recognized in sample analysis from the Great Lakes was that these were primary source plastic pollutants, not the typical photo degraded types found in the ocean,"" says Wilson, adding that the microbeads really stood out on the calm lake surface. In the five oceanic gyres, plastics have been broken down by sunlight, and are harder to see. Going to the source Following on the success of a collaborative social media campaign with the Plastic Soup Foundation that led to Unilever's commitment to phase out the microbeads, 5 Gyres went after other companies including Proctor &amp; Gamble, Johnson &amp; Johnson, The Body Shop, and L'Oreal. ""P&amp;G brushed us off, and we bombed them with 15,000 letters and absolutely shut down their email communications at the VP level for several days. Finally, they sent one email that said they'd discontinue using beads by the end of 2017,"" Wilson says. ""That was in June, 2013."" Five Gyres wasn't satisfied with that timeline and continued to send letters, pushing for a 2015 phase out, Wilson says. However, as of this article, P&amp;G still hasn't provided more information to 5 Gyres as to when that phase out will occur. ""To say any of them have been real proactive is a stretch because the phase out was nonbinding, and the dates became moving targets,"" says Wilson, adding that the Personal Care Products Lobby have said they need a long time to ""reformulate."" ""We can't get a straight answer from any producer,"" Wilson says. Reduce the demand to reduce the supply? Working with big business isn't the only way 5 Gyres is working to create change and awareness. The non-profit has also shifted some of the responsibility to consumers with a recently released platform called ""Beat The Microbead"". The sub-site and app, both of which were developed in-house, allow consumers to scan the barcode of personal care products to determine whether they contain plastic microbeads and whether the manufacturer has agreed to remove them or not. There are also other tools for educated consumers who wish to environmentally navigate the sea of microbead infused products: in addition to the ""Beat the Microbead"" app, Fauna &amp; Flora International has created The Good Scrub Guide, a listing of face scrubs that are free from plastic microbeads and that are currently available on the UK market. Tanya Cox, project officer of marine plastics for Fauna &amp; Flora International, and Wilson's ""international partner,"" says she is hoping to increase the scope and user-friendliness of the guide in the future and make it available for more countries where FFI works. Brands wishing to feature their products on the guide must first confirm with Cox that the product is free from solid, plastic microbeads made from polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethyl-terephthalate (PET), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and nylon. Legal protections Another route for combating microbeads is through laws restricting their use. Currently, 5 Gyres is working with New York, California, Minnesota and Illinois to prohibit the sale of personal care products containing microbeads. New York and California are already leading the way: this past February, they introduced legislation to ban microplastics in cosmetics. Cox says that these laws could have long-reaching effects that extend far beyond the boundaries of the US. ""We, the wider group of international NGOs working on this issue, are also looking at ways that existing European law can be altered to encompass something like this. But progress is likely to be much slower unfortunately,"" Cox says. ""We are excited to see the outcome of legislation in the States because it may mean that large multi-nationals such as Johnson &amp; Johnson and Proctor &amp; Gamble will simply phase out microbead use globally in a much shorter timeframe than currently being discussed."" The EU, which touts a ""Precautionary Principle"" to restrict and ban substances that might be harmful to humans, is leading the way for other countries to be accountable when companies refuse to. The U.S. is much more lenient. In fact, To date, the EU has banned 1,100 chemicals in cosmetics while the Food and Drug Administration in America has banned only ten. Natural alternatives Some of the natural replacements for microbeads also have negative consequences. Greg Boyer, chair of the chemistry department at SUNY-College of Environmental Science and Forestry, says a possible negative consequence is with degrading sugars that biochemically ""burn"" the sugar for energy. ""If you have any type of stratified water column – there may not be enough oxygen present to support this process, hence the bacteria draw down the oxygen to a point where fish and other critters die,"" says Boyer, adding that a classic example is the Lake Erie deadzones where the bottom water layer is very thin. ""The algae grow in the top water, settle down to the bottom waters and the bacteria decompose them and use all the available oxygen in the bottom waters,"" he says. ""Adding a natural carbon source, either sugar or nut shell, would only make the problem worse."" Because synthetic microplastic beads don't degrade well, they don't tend to cause this problem. Wilson argues, however, that this biodegradability is actually a key strength for non-microbead abrasives. ""As long as the alternatives are sourced sustainably, my feeling is that their legacy in the natural environment - post-consumer use - will be much lower than that of microplastics,"" he says. A variety of biodegradable ingredients are available to developers. Victoria Fantauzzi, co-founder of Chicago-based La Bella Figura Beauty, says that her company recently released a facial cleanser that uses enzymes found in papaya and pineapple, ingredients known to effectively exfoliate skin cells. Fantauzzi points out that another company, Odacite, uses natural exfoliants like jojoba beads, which are made from a biodegradable natural wax. She says that, while jojoba beads exfoliate in much the same way as microbeads, they are a gentler alternative and are less likely to harm sewer systems or the environment. Unfortunately, Fantauzzi says, there's a catch: sustainable ingredients often cost more – and can have a more problematic supply chain. ""Non-sustainable businesses seem to lose ethics when it comes to sourcing ingredients,"" she explains. ""They pay cheaply and in the interim rainforests are destroyed or farmers lose business as their product gets outsourced to a different grower willing to take the cost hit."" This can have a devastating effect on farming communities: ""In some cases, as in Mexico, they lose generations of family farms to companies who come in to produce cheap crops using cheap labor and GMO seeds,"" Fantauzzi adds. But, she says, if smaller companies like hers can commit to providing microbead-free scrub options, then there should be no reason a larger, better known company can't. ""It's all about being dedicated to change but the truth is, even those resistant companies will have no choice in becoming compliant with these new laws. They will have to be or they will not be allowed to retail in a growing billion dollar market like the EU,"" Fantauzzi says. ""It's really about being committed to change and how you want to sleep every night,"" she adds. Amy DuFault is a writer and sustainable fashion consultant.

126,article,global-development-professionals-network/2014/apr/08/seed-banks-india-pakistan-grassroots-support,Global Development Professionals Network,2014-04-08,Seed banks in south Asia: building grassroots support for crop diversity,https://gu.com/p/3na9z,News,Seed banks in south Asia: building grassroots support for crop diversity,Seed banks improve food security and help preserve indigenous farming practices. How can they be better supported by development efforts?,796,"While 2014 has been recognised as the international year of family farming, it's important for the global development community to recognise how useful and important seed banks can be to food security in developing countries. The goal of a seed bank is to increase local seed and food security, and contribute to genetic diversity. Seed banks can offer storage facilities for good quality, local seed varieties. They also facilitate seed exchange and seed saving. These collections of seeds are maintained, managed and administered by the local community. India has seen over 110 seed banks being established in response to the ""recolonisation"" of the agriculture sector, where an influx of international seed corporations such as Monsanto and Syngenta are arriving in India, resulting in a corporate takeover. Vandana Shiva's work at Navdanya is concerned with biopiracy and seed freedom (pdf) – the organisation wants to abolish GMO seed varieties, so that farmers can grow comfortably without being constrained by a profit-making cycle of costly and unnatural input. Another notable example from South Asia is Oxfam's efforts in Nepal towards the migration of male members of households to India. Oxfam developed community seed banks to empower and support the women in Dadeldurah and Dailekh districts of Nepal, giving them not only a source of livelihood but also a community-based support system. The South Asia watch on trade, environment and economics has set up numerous trade platforms and circulated policy briefings on how to set up seed banks. These include setting up a regional seed bank by facilitating the formation of inter-country partnerships; an increased seed replacement rate to ensure quality; preserving heritage varieties – and, lastly, fair pricing of seed varieties for farmers. Nonetheless, some have been quicker than others to adopt seed banks at community level, perhaps because seed-saving and swapping is a traditional practice amongst many farming families. However, we need to realise that indigenous/local ways of farming are under threat; on the precipice of being forgotten or sabotaged by big corporations. And in many cases they need to be updated due to climate change and other anthropogenic phenomenon that directly impact the agriculture sector. In South Asia, farm-saved seeds and informal exchanges contribute towards 70–90% of the total seed supply. Establishing seed banks here is to formalise these channels and ensure the quality of seeds being exchanged are good, local and don't result in a dependency on chemical inputs. In the last thirty years or so, the agriculture industry has seen a number of changes. A capitalist cloud looms, with big companies striking deals in emerging markets while using corporate social responsibility to present their softer credentials. The prevalence of seed banks in Pakistan has been limited to combat post-disaster rehabilitation efforts. Numerous aid agencies, such as Action Aid and Concern Worldwide, saw seed banks as a prompt and effective way to distribute seeds to normalise household conditions after the floods in 2010. However, despite protests and activism, seed banks are still not seen as a long-term solution in that part of the world – primarily due to tenancy farming or feudalism (particularly in the south). The case in India is slightly different as independence from the British in 1947 saw India undergo agrarian reforms and, although the situation is far from perfect, farmers have more control over their land and there is better recognition of farmers' rights. According to a recent report from the Pakistan Institute of Labour Education and Research, the feudal land ownership system is a brick wall for all development efforts – whether aimed at improving infrastructure, improved water resource management or community mobilisation. This is largely to do with control of peasant population and restricting access to resources and, when combined with poor governance at the national level, means negligible support for the smallholder. A phenomenon that can be observed in the late recognition of the recent droughts in Tharparkar. It comes down to politics, where community-based efforts go to waste against the even more historic practice of feudalism. According to the Sustainable Development Policy Institute in Pakistan ""there is no national agriculture policy in Pakistan."" Aid agencies need to focus on getting farmers to join and contribute to seed banks but they also need to spend a significant amount of time in dialogue with landowners who manage the lands, supply the seeds and acquire the end product. The dialogue can also supplement and support the infrastructural developments for water availability and irrigation. This is not to say grassroot efforts may go amiss but we must not forget the historical socio-economic issues countries are still entrenched in.

Opponents are still adamant they are not. What is the latest evidence on both sides?</p>",2901,"I’ve had to sign off, I’m afraid. There is much, much more to look at. As part of the redesigned Reality Check homepage we will be trying to corral blogs on similar subjects into the same place, so I look forward to re-opening this debate soon. I can’t post and reply to all the links you have sent below the line and by Twitter before I close, but I will go through them as soon as I can and either update the blog or add a list of some of those I think worth following below the line. Thanks for such a great response today. I don’t have a firm view before or against GM - despite what some of you seem to think! - so I really appreciated the very high number of people sending good information, pertinent challenges and links to source material. It’s fair to say today’s stated aim was too ambitious for the time available. I’ve only managed to really address the growing of GM crops (not the eating of them as the title suggested), and only really analysed the latest key report arguing they are safe. A start, but much more work can be done. I have also not had time to address the risk of crop contamination, say to organic farmers. And as GM technology develops, the debate will evolve too. For example the latest UK report looks forward to more non-plant genes being used in crops: The next generation of GM crops is expected to be improved not only by transfer of genetic elements between crop species but also from diverse organisms into crops.﻿ The exercise has some tentative conclusions though: There is agreement that since most GM crops are adapted to be tolerant to herbicides and pesticides, many more chemicals are sprayed, leading to resistant weeds and insects, and loss of biodiversity; pro- and anti-GM arguments differ on whether banning GM or changing farming practices is the answer. No serious risk to human health has been proven, though given the some of the more sweeping statements of safety seem to be misplaced; however even supporters acknowledge some of the processes that cause concern, but they argue this applies equally to non GM food. Wiser supporters of GM are not saying it is and will always be risk-free - their argument is a more nuanced suggestion that the principle of GM is not inherently risky and/or GM crops are no more risky than traditional varieties, and so GM plants should be regulated in the same way. One of the links I have been sent by opponents of GM is to an interview with Tom Dempsey, head of the US Snack Foods Association. In his conversation with the website bakeryandsnacks.com, Dempsey talks about why “in their masses” manufacturers were removing GM ingredients from their products: Clearly in a litigious society that we have right now, whether you are right or wrong, that litigation costs hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars. So if you can do it, if you can in effect make your end product GMO-free at an attractive price, then it’s a benefit to do it. Note, Dempsey is not saying there is any basis to the litigation, but clearly manufacturers are not confident enough to ignore it. It is curious they were happy to include GM ingredients early on, but are not now there is a longer history of evidence. In light of this, a line from the UK report today strikes me as potentially significant. It says, almost in passing: The last crop to benefit from GM technology has been sugarbeet, with a herbicide resistant variety introduced in the USA in 2012, and now accounting for around 95% of the crop grown.﻿ From zero to almost everything in two years or less seems like a very short time span to judge the long term impact of this crop. Continuing the summary and responses of the evidence in today’s report that there is no reliable evidence of harm from GM crops, part two is environmental damage. For clarity the report claims are in bold, my summary of responses in italics. The report admits there is “no question” that widespread growing of herbicide tolerant crops has led to wider spraying of herbicide chemicals, resulting in the development of resistant super-weeds, and the “likely” reduction in wider biodiversity. It also accepts there could have been examples of damage to non-target insects, and has been cross-pollination with non-GM plants. However the authors suggest this is not the fault of the GM crops per se (their italics), but farm management (such as the intensive use of certain chemicals), and could also have happened with conventionally bred plants. It suggests the answer is better farm management. Opponents of GM might point out that the very point of developing herbicide tolerant plants was so farmers could spray more chemicals. It is the case though that farming has a history of having to adapt to short-term mistakes, and could learn to manage this better. They also claim there are “a number of environmental benefits” including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, reduced soil tillage (used to tackle weeds) and the nutrient loss this causes, and the use of “more benign” herbicides. To support this claim they cite the following paper: “ Brookes, G. &amp; Barfoot, P., 2013b, Key environmental impacts of global genetically modified (GM) crop use 1996-2011. GM Crops and Food: Biotechnology in Agriculture and the Food Chain, 4(2), pp.109–119.” It turns out this is a report by the two owners of a consultancy, PG Economics, who specialise in advising the industry about plant biotechnology, among other things. This is not to suggest their work is not rigorous and honest, only to point out that as a single source for a sweeping claim of environmental benefits it might be considered weak. Today’s report is unambiguous: There are no reliable data indicating inherent risk for human or animal health, for the environment or from unforseen effects. Later it goes into more detail on those three points. Here is my summary of what they say about human and animal health, and reaction or comment in italics after each point raised. I will take on the other two areas in later posts. A few studies led by an Italian scientist Gilles-Eric Séralini have reported health risks from GM food and animal feed, notably one in 2012 linking a herbicide-tolerant maize to tumours and early death in rats. The report says “in each case, the scientific community and food safety authorities found that the evidence did not support the conclusions”, and notes that the 2012 paper was later withdrawn by the journal. John Vidal has pointed me to scientists who are alarmed at the way Séralini and others have been vilified. You can see their response here. The report notes some criticsims are based on “hypotheses that harm could occur under certain scenarios”, notably the risk that plant genes could effect genes in animal organs. The authors say this has already been “described” for non GM plants. They do not, however, address the suggested bio-security hazard directly. This is perhaps because the focus of the report is on changing regulation to make it easier to plant GM crops but still acknowledging some will not pass regulatory safety tests. A review of 24 studies of health impacts of GM food found “no statistically significant differences between GM and non-GM crops within the parameters observed” (my italics), however other studies have been “inconclusive”. On this point the evidence looks more mixed, something which does not feel well reflected in the more bullish summary statement at the top of this post. In the US “there have been no successful lawsuits, no product recalls, no substantiated ill effects, and no other evidence of risk from a GM crop product intended for human consumption.” While there have been no major public health scandals in the US , I am following at least one lead which could call this into question - or might not, it is too soon to say. I have asked the Guardian’s environment editor John Vidal to address the argument that GM crops have been planted in many countries over two decades and there are no proven problems. This is a very important strand of today’s report to David Cameron. The Guardian employs notable journalists who support, or do not have a particular antipathy to GM crops or food. However as the case for GM has been put so powerfully by the report which prompted today’s debate I particularly asked John to counterbalance this with a summary of the arguments on the other side. These can be followed up in detail where necessary. John writes: Hundreds of millions of people and animals regularly eat GM foods seemingly without problem and the industry has argued that this effective giant feeding trial means the food and crops must be safe. But there are legitimate, nagging doubts because there is still no requirement in any country for companies to conduct long term trials. Distrust of GM foods has built worldwide because little public research into their safety is published and what there is has been largely financed by the GM companies themselves. Moreover, there is no requirement to test the food by feeding it to successive generations of mice or rats to see whether it has any identifiable impact. Critics say that the whole regulatory regime for GM crops is based on information provided by the industry. While most researchers agree there is no safety issue, whenever any serious issue is raised, the industry and its lobbyists have rushed to attack both the research and smear the scientist. According to some scientists, there is now a a de facto ban on asking certain questions about the safety of the foods with few scientists daring to publish critical studies. However, last year a group of 93 scientists declared that there was no scientific consensus on the safety of genetically modified foods and crops. (This number has now risen to 297.) UK plans to grow herbicide-tolerant GM crops commercially were abandoned in 2004 following the farm scale evaluations, which showed that blanket spraying with weedkillers destroyed important habitats for birds, butterflies and other wildlife. Ten years on, more complex mixtures of herbicides are being used to control pests but little research has been published showing how the cocktails of chemicals may inter-act.﻿ Quotes from today’s report published by the Council for Science and Technology: The acreage under GM cultivation is doubling every five years and now accounts for some 12% of global arable land. In 2012, biotech crops represented 35% of the global commercial seed market. In the USA, between 500 – 1,000 field trial applications are approved per annum and 96 applications for commercialisation have been approved since 1990. Several North and South America countries have followed the USA. In contrast, in Europe there is only one GM crop approved for commercial cultivation, a Bt-insect-resistant maize. The total area of GM maize grown in the EU in 2012 was 129,000 hectares, of which more than 90% was grown in Spain. Although less than 0.1% of the global acreage of GM crops is cultivated in the EU, more than 70% of EU animal protein feed requirements are imported as GM crop products. There are few commercial releases of GM crops in Africa (principally in South Africa) (IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute) 2013). In Asia, there are several countries, including China, that have adopted GM crops with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Almost everybody I have talked to today has said words to the effect of: of course it isn’t about the science, it’s about the politics. This blog is trying to focus on the science, for want of a better description, but helpfully the Guardian hosts Jack Stilgoe’s political science blog, which has a post on this today: Another key thrust of the pro-argument is that, to put it rather crudely, lots and lots of this stuff is grown in the US, and no harm has been proved. Clearly this statement deserves a lot of scrutiny, and much of it will hinge on what is deemed harm, and to what extent it can or might still be proved. But it is probably an argument which will have more public resonance than many, and the figures involved are compelling - if only for the sheer scale of GM over the other side of the Atlantic. The US Department of Agriculture helpfully published its latest report on GM just last month. Note this refers to Genetically Engineered - or GE - plants and crops. For the sheer scale of GM in the US, take this: ﻿Three crops (corn, cotton, and soybeans) make up the bulk of the acres planted to GE crops. U.S. farmers planted about 169 million acres of these GE crops in 2013, or about half of total land used to grow crops. To put this in context the entire land area of the UK is approximately 60m acres. As for how safe this makes GM, Baulcombe says: The European roadblock on GM would be appropriate if there were evidence for an intrinsic hazard, but there is not. In the highly litigious USA, there has been no example for more than 20 years of any harm or legal damages being awarded due to GM crops.﻿ The statement that there “is not” any evidence of an intrinsic hazard will be one of the questions I will focus on today. I try not to overuse headlines, but to help navigate the different arguments that are bound to come up in an illogical order, I will do today. Professor Sir David Baulcombe in his Guardian comment piece today makes a significant claim about the safety of GM crops compared to standard plant breeding techniques. His argument is that GM varieties are less risky because very few new genes are transferred and they are carefully selected: Even the possibility of “unknown unknowns” does not stand up as a legitimate concern because the unpredictability of a new GM variety is much less than in conventional breeding. In GM a few new genes are transferred but, in a conventional hybrid, there are 30,000 genes from each parent and we have no way of predicting how they will interact. There is no suggestion that conventional breeding should be subject to a complex and politicised regulatory process but, correspondingly, there is no reason why GM should have this burden. ﻿I do not have the scientific knowledge to challenge or confirm this, although an early question that arises is to what extent non plant genes are being transferred into crop seeds, which does not happen with conventional hybrids. I’d be interested if any readers do have more specialist knowledge of this area, and will of course seek out other experts as soon as possible. The Guardian and other newspapers carry stories today on a significant new report on growing GM crops. The government’s chief scientific advisor Professor Sir Mark Walport backs the report which urges the UK to “forge ahead” with planting GM crops, to improve food production, help keep farms profitable and stop the UK falling behind in a growing global industry. A letter from the scientists summarising their arguments and two fuller reports can be read here. The Guardian also carries a comment article by the report’s lead author Professor Sir David Baulcombe of the University of Cambridge, describing how people around the world, including UK consumers, are already exposed to GM: Most of the world’s cotton and soy are genetically modified and other crops including maize, papaya and rapeseed are benefiting from this new technology. However, although we do not grow GM crops widely in Europe, we do import GM animal feed. Bizarrely, our animals eat GM quite safely although we do not have the option. While Europe has approved just two GM crops for growing, the US now allows 96. Walport also says: It makes much more logical sense to regulate on a product-by-product basis: technologies are neither universally safe, nor universally unsafe. It seems the pro-GM lobby is gaining momentum. As the Guardian’s journalist Damian Carrington reports in his story, in January, the environment secretary, Owen Paterson backed GM crops in a speech, saying: “Europe risks becoming the museum of world farming as innovative companies make decisions to invest and develop new technologies in other markets.” The European Acadamies Science Advisory Council has also concluded “there is no rational basis for the current stringent regulatory process” in the EU. For all this, stringent opposition remains to growing - and eating - GM crops. Arguments against GM crops mostly focus on the dangers for human and animal health, risks to the environment, and whether they actually deliver on the promises to greatly increase food production, for example by making crops tolerant to pests, diseases or lack of water. Today we will focus on just the growing of the crops, consider the latest evidence on both sides, and see if they can ever be reconciled. Individuals can chose not to eat GM, after all, but if it is grown in the UK that affects everyone, opponents and supporters alike.

128,article,sustainable-business/cheerios-general-mills-gmo-genetically-modified-food,Guardian Sustainable Business,2014-02-19,Why are food activists targeting Honey Nut Cheerios?,https://gu.com/p/3mpqt,,Why are food activists targeting Honey Nut Cheerios?,The oat-based cereal doesn't have many ingredients that could be genetically modified,860,"The GMO Inside campaign wants to get genetically modified organisms out of the US food system. So it's starting where we all start: breakfast. The campaign, a coalition of businesses and nonprofit organizations, is taking aim at the popular breakfast cereal Honey Nut Cheerios, pressing producer General Mills to remove anything that could even potentially be genetically modified. Citing concerns about environmental degradation, corporate control of agriculture and food safety, the group is encouraging consumers to sign an online petition and to contact the company on social media and by email to express their opposition to GMOs. ""We're not going to give up on Honey Nut Cheerios until we succeed,"" Nicole McCann, director of food campaigns for Green America, an environmental nonprofit that is part of the campaign, said. ""All of our followers are putting pressure on them."" The GMO Inside campaign also owns two shares of General Mills stock, which has allowed spokespeople to attend shareholders meetings and raise questions about the use of genetically engineered ingredients. This effort is a follow-up to a previous GMO Inside campaign that targeted the original Cheerios, an initiative the group says generated 25,000 emails and 40,000 calls for action on the brand's Facebook page. In January, General Mills announced that it no longer uses GMOs in classic Cheerios. The company did not acknowledge the effect of any of the anti-GMO campaigns, but rather explained on a company blog that it made the change because ""we think consumers may embrace it"". Genetically modified foods are plants whose genetic code has been engineered to select for certain traits: yield, pesticide resistance, color. They are worrisome for several reasons, said McCann. Their widespread use is causing a decline in crop diversity, leaving our food supply more vulnerable to disaster, she and others argue. Furthermore, strains engineered to withstand pesticides can lead to more liberal use of such chemicals, potentially causing environmental damage, they say. There is also concern that changing a plant's genetic codes could make them unsafe for consumption in the long-term; opponents say GMOs might increase the risk of allergies, digestive issues and organ damage. The crops most likely to be genetically modified include alfalfa, canola, corn, soy and sugar beets. But the principal ingredient of both regular and Honey Nut Cheerios is oats, a plant that is not genetically modified. The components that most concern GMO opponents are ingredients used in much smaller amounts: sugar, corn starch and vitamin E, which can be derived from soy. So why is GMO Inside campaign targeting these products? In part, precisely because these foods have so few GMO ingredients, making a change much more feasible than for products more heavily dependent on genetically engineered ingredients, said campaign director Elizabeth O'Connell. Also, the popularity of Honey Nut Cheerios – the country's best-selling cereal – means a small change in its ingredients could send an outsized message. ""They're not the lone bad actors,"" O'Connell said. But ""if they changed, they could have a big impact."" In January, Post Foods also announced that it had removed GMOs from one of its signature cereals, Grape-Nuts. The Kellogg's-owned Kashi brand has been removing GMOs from its cereals since early 2012; today 11 of its 25 Kashi cold cereals are certified GMO-free by the Non-GMO Project, a nonprofit group that verifies such claims. The US cold breakfast cereal industry generates about $10.1bn annually and more than 91% of households buy cold cereal, according to market research firm Mintel. This high market penetration has made cereal a rich target for those looking to effect widespread change in the use of genetically modified ingredients. GMO Inside is also targeting Chobani, the country's leading brand of Greek yogurt, which it says uses dairy products that may come from cows raised on genetically modified feed. So far, General Mills has resisted making other Cheerios varieties GMO-free, contending on its website that it was the ""unique and simple nature of original Cheerios"" that allowed the company to keep it free of GMOs. Other versions of the cereal have more ingredients that could be genetically modified, and thus it would be ""difficult, if not impossible"" to make the switch. The company also argues that health concerns about government-approved GMO ingredients are unwarranted, noting that there is ""broad consensus among major global scientific and regulatory bodies"" that such foods do not pose a threat. The US Food and Drug Administration and the United Nations World Health Organization have both expressed the belief that approved GMOs are safe for human consumption. Supporters of genetically engineered crops also argue that these techniques can improve crop production and yields, helping reduce global food shortages. GMO Inside, however, argues that the potential problems associated with genetic modifications are very real. And if General Mills could remove GMO ingredients from classic Cheerios, it is feasible to remove these ingredients from other cereals as well, O'Connell said. ""It might be slightly more complicated, but not impossible,"" she said. ""They just need to get the right amount of consumer demand.""

The retailer chain Whole Foods plans to label and limit genetically-modified products in its stores, and General Mills recently announced that Cheerios are GMO-free and will be labelled as such. State legislators in Maine and Connecticut have voted to require mandatory labelling of foods containing GMOS, provided that nearby states follow suit. But even as consumers, brands and governments debate GMOs, farmers around the world – who, presumably, know what's good for them – are growing more biotech crops than ever, a new report says. More than 18 million farmers in 27 countries planted biotech crops on about 175m hectares of land last year, a modest 3% increase in global biotech crop land over 2013, according to an annual survey released by a non-profit group called the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications (ISAAA). Biotech crop land area has grown every year since commercial planting began in 1996, the report says. ""Millions of small and larger farmers in both industrial and developing countries have adopted this technology for one main reason: It deliver benefits,"" says Clive James, the author of the report and ISAAA's founder and chairman emeritus. While the report does not attempt to document the benefits of biotech crops, James says they reduce pesticide use, which saves farmers money, and increase productivity. More than 90% (16.5 million) of farmers planting biotech crops are small and resource-poor, the report says. While the US remains by far the world leader in biotech crops, more than half of the biotech crop land area is now cultivated by farmers in Latin America, Asia and Africa. Most grow cotton. Typically, the adoption cycle for biotech crops moves from fibre (cotton) to feed (soybeans and corn that are fed to livestock) and only then to food. That said, biotech crops remain concentrated in five big countries – the US, Brazil, Argentina, India and Canada – which together account for nearly 90% of the world's biotech acreage. So, despite the rapid adoption of biotech crops, the report shows that the most common argument on their behalf, advanced by companies such as Monsanto – that they will be needed to feed a growing and hungry planet – remains unproven, to say the least. Nearly all of the GM crops being cultivated are herbicide-tolerant or pesticide-tolerant, which ""means that existing GMOs remain essentially an appendage of the pesticide industry, which has dominated the technology from the start,"" as Tom Philpott put it recently in Grist. James says that will soon change, noting that the first planting of drought-tolerant crops took place last year. In the US, about 2,000 farmers in the corn belt planted about 50,000 hectares of the first biotech drought-tolerant corn, developed by Monsanto and BASF. Five African countries have joined a partnership called Water Efficient Maize for Africa that aims to develop drought-tolerant and insect-protected maize, with funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Howard G Buffett Foundation, and USAID. Maize is the most widely grown staple crop in Africa – more than 300 million Africans depend on it as their main food source – and it is severely affected by frequent drought. Meanwhile, Indonesia has approved planting of the world's first drought-tolerant sugarcane, and it plans to commercialise it this year, according to the ISAAA. Bangladesh has approved commercial cultivation of eggplant that has been genetically modified to resist insect damage. ""That's significant,"" said James, because ""Bangladesh is one of the poorest of the poor. Very small area. Huge population."" Biotech crops remain controversial, and not just in Europe. While the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute is part of the Gates and Buffett foundation-funded effort to develop drought-resistant corn, Kenya's cabinet banned imports of GMOs in 2012. China does not permit biotech crops to be grown for food. That said, the global survey is the best evidence we have that a growing number of farmers believe that biotech crops enable them to reduce costs, or improve their productivity, or work less. These farmers could be mistaken, of course; they are influenced by the seed companies, by their peers and, in the developing world, by the inducements of foundation or US government aid. But as Steve Savage, an industry consultant who blogs about agriculture, told me, biotech crops are one of a number of key tools that should be made available to farmers, along with faster conventional breeding, better equipment, storage technology and crop protection chemicals: The farmers are the ones who integrate all of this to continue making the sort of gains we have seen for decades. For developing world subsistence farmers, there are clearly cases where free GMO crops like virus resistant cassava would help a great deal, but they also need far more basic things like a functional farm-credit system, crop insurance, a bit of fertiliser and infrastructure for storage and transport to market. So it isn't about whether any one technology will ""feed the world"". Farmers will feed the world and always have. We would do well to respect the choices they want to make.",,0.1519818722943723
130,article,sustainable-business/food-coop-cocoa-alter-eco-farmers,Guardian Sustainable Business,2014-02-04,Can a small business make a big impact on sustainability?,https://gu.com/p/3mepp,,Can fast-growing Alter Eco push the envelope on sustainability?,"Alter Eco is growing quickly and doing almost everything right, but the small company's ambitions are to drive major change",656,"What would a truly sustainable food company look like? That's hard to say, but a small company called Alter Eco, which sells quinoa, rice, chocolate and sugar grown in Latin America, Asia and Africa, offers a clue or two. Striving to hit the very highest environmental and social standards, Alter Eco sources only Fair Trade commodities, buying from small-farm co-operatives. Its products are certified organic. It offsets its carbon emissions. And, when the founders could not find packaging that satisfied them, they designed their own: a bio-based, backyard-compostable package with no petroleum or chemicals or genetically modified corn. ""We are trying to push the envelope towards full sustainability,"" CEO Mathieu Senard says. The trouble is, Alter Eco is small – it reported just $7m in revenues in 2012. When I visited co-founders Senard and Edouard Rollet at Alter Eco's headquarters in San Francisco, they told me that sales topped $10m in 2013 and are expected to jump 44% to $14.5m this year. ""We can go to $100m in the next five to 10 years,"" Senard claims. That said, big food companies measure their sales in billions, not millions. General Mills booked sales of nearly $18bn in the 2013 fiscal year, meaning it does more business in a day than Alter Eco does in a year. For small, socially responsible companies like Alter Eco to have a big impact, they either need to grow rapidly, or influence their much larger competitors, or both. To its credit, Alter Eco already has transformed the lives of tens of thousands of poor farmers since it began in France in 1998. Senard, 39, and Rollet, 38, who are both French, brought the brand to the US in 2003, importing rice from Thailand, quinoa from Bolivia, sugar from the Phillipines and chocolate from Peru and Ecuador. All of the commodities that Alter Eco sells are grown on co-operatives, some with fewer than 100 farmers and others with thousands. The co-operative structure insures that farmers manage their own business and decide how to spend the premium that comes with Fair Trade. ""Whether they are large co-ops or small co-ops, they are co-ops of small-scale farmers, organized democratically, farmer-owned,"" Rollet told me. ""They control their own destiny."" With its global supply chain, Alter Eco generates carbon emissions, but the company says that it offsets even more than it generates by working with partners. In Peru, for example, it pays for cocoa farmers who are part of the Acopagro co-op to plant thousands of trees, including teak trees, which absorb carbon, help replenish the soil and should eventually generate additional income for farmers. Lately, Alter Eco has been working on its packaging. ""We couldn't call ourselves a sustainable company if we put plastic in landfills,"" Rollet says. The company has designed a compostable package with no petroleum or chemicals or GMO corn, without sacrificing shelf life or quality. To bring down the costs of making the new package, Alter Eco is working with like-minded companies including Clif Bar, Numi and Guayquil to bring it to market. None of this comes cheap. A 16oz bag of Alter Eco Thai Sticky Purple Rice sells online for $4.79 – a lot more than Uncle Ben's – largely because the company wants to treat its farmers well. It's also one reason coffee from Starbucks costs more than the brew from 7-Eleven. Alter Eco's mission has attracted investments from individuals, including the philanthropist and activist Josh Mailman, and investment funds including Good Capital and Renewal Funds, which seek to use the power of business to solve social and environmental problems. But the question remains: can Alter Eco grow beyond its niche? The founders say they want to reposition the company so it's known for quality, as well as sustainability. At the same time, they don't want to drop their messaging around Fair Trade. ""We have too many things to say,"" Senard says. As well as much to do to magnify Alter Eco's impact.",,0.16854176687510022
131,article,sustainable-business/danny-grossman-wild-planet-slow-food-fast-people,Guardian Sustainable Business,2013-12-19,Wild Planet Toys founder Danny Grossman's new food venture,https://gu.com/p/3yb6h,,Wild Planet Toys founder Danny Grossman starts energy bar company,"Slow Food for Fast People makes savory - not sweet - bars and plans to 'look for every element we possibly can to express our values,' Grossman says",846,"At 55, Danny Grossman already has lived a full life. He enjoyed a fascinating career in the foreign service: He was stationed in India and in Soviet Union-era Leningrad, where he was doing human rights work before he was accused of being a spy and expelled. And 20 years ago, he started a company called Wild Planet Toys, which sells socially responsible toys designed to spark childrens' imaginations. The company grew to have revenues of $60m before it was sold to Spinmaster, a bigger firm, in 2012. Now Grossman is back in startup mode, this time with a company called Slow Food for Fast Lives that sells healthy, natural energy bars for people on the go. His partners in the venture are also serial, purpose-driven entrepreneurs: Mel and Patricia Ziegler, who founded Banana Republic and Republic of Tea. ""We'd like to contribute to the movement of people being thoughtful about not just what they eat, but where it comes from and what its impact is,"" said Grossman, when we met for coffee in the West Portal neighborhood of San Francisco, where he grew up and still lives. Like Wild Planet Toys, Slow Food for Fast Lives is a values-based business – that is, a company that aims to treat people fairly, sell a product that enhances people's lives, protects the environment and, at least in theory, leave the world a little better off. ""All of us are committed to supporting the healthy-food movement, for lack of a better term,"" Grossman said. A savory difference It joins a US food-bar market worth $5.7b a year, according to the research firm Packaged Facts. That market is growing, crowded and increasingly specialized – think Clif Bar, PowerBars, Balance Bars, Kind Bars, Chia Bars, LaraBar, Promax Bars, Green Superfood bars, vegan, gluten-free, crunchy, gooey. There's even the Yaff Bar, ""an all-natural bar made to share""...with your dog. (Look it up.) Grossman, who coaches his boys in Little League, and the Zieglers, who are frequent travelers, say they often ended up hungry while on the go. They'd search for a convenient snack, but found themselves having to choose between ""junk snack food that would leave us feeling miserable or a compromise with yet another chocolate-covered sugary extruded energy bar,"" as they put it on their website. Grossman had read Different: Escaping the Competitive Herd by Harvard Business School professor Youngme Moon and knew they would have to zig, as she put it, when everyone else zagged. Virtually all the energy bars on the market are sweet, so he chose to go savory. ""Why can't there be a bar that has healthy ingredients and savory and inspired by global flavors?"" he asked. Patricia Ziegler, an accomplished cook, began experimenting with fresh vegetables, fruits and nuts. Over time, with the help of professional food scientists, they came up with four flavors: California (almond, kale, pomegranate, quinoa), Indian (cashew, cumin, cauliflower, coconut), Moroccan (pistachio, currant, carrot, ginger) and Thai (peanut, chili, brown rice, bell pepper). Until you try one, you'll have to trust me that they taste better than they sound. ""The ingredients are primarily vegetables, nuts and spices, which also add health benefits,"" Grossman said. ""No sugar. All real food. Nothing processed."" The bars are packaged in colorful wrappers, with artwork by Patricia Ziegler, and are clear at one end so that ""you can see the lentils and the peas and the cauliflower,"" Grossman said. Transparency, literally. Turning values into actions So what makes this a values-based business? In that regard, Slow Food for Fast Lives is still a work in progress, Grossman admits. ""We'll look for every element we possibly can to express our values,"" he said. Yes, the bars aim to be more nutritious than the competing choices (although they contain fats and sweeteners like brown rice syrup and honey). And the company will give away extra bars to people in need and eventually intends to source organic and non-GMO ingredients. Job one, though, is getting the bars produced, distributed and marketed, with a very lean staff – himself and an operations manager. All other functions are outsourced. With Wild Planet Toys, he recalls, the socially responsible features were built up over time. The company consulted psychologists on patterns of imaginative play, supported strong sourcing standards through the toy industry association and held a contest for children to invent their own toys, bringing the winning ideas to market. It also created toys and games aiming to provide additional benefits beyond fun. One such game, called Hyper Dash, promoted physical activity. A toy called Spy Gear (""the leader in Secret Agent and Special Ops Gear"") promoted childhood curiosity. Spy Gear was not inspired by Grossman's own activities in Soviet Russia, where he was not a spy, he insists to this day. I asked Grossman: Is starting a values-based business any easier today? Yes, he replied. Back then, he said, ""I had to do so much explaining, especially to investors, but really to all partners."" Now, when he's looking for more sustainable packaging or a source of organic ingredients, he said, ""the concept is well understood"".",,0.15593537414965983
132,article,sustainable-business/mcdonalds-fries-innate-potato-genetically-modified-food,Guardian Sustainable Business,2013-12-04,McDonald's GMO dilemma: why fries are causing such a fuss,https://gu.com/p/3yvvz,,McDonald's GMO dilemma: why fries are causing such a fuss,"Plenty of GMO food probably already makes it on to your plate, and the scientific consensus is that it's safe to eat. So why are activists so opposed to genetically modified potatoes?",976,"""Do you want fries with that?"" Not if they're made from genetically engineered potatoes, say activists who oppose GMOs. The advocacy group Food &amp; Water Watch is asking McDonald's, the world's biggest buyer of potatoes, not to source a genetically engineered spud that was developed by its biggest supplier, the J.R. Simplot Co. ""This potato is anything but healthy,"" writes Wenonah Hauter, the executive director of Food and Water Watch, in a letter (PDF) to Don Thompson, McDonald's CEO. Altering the plant's genes, she writes, could unintentionally affect other characteristics of the potato, ""with potentially unforeseen consequences for human health"". The letter has been signed by 102,000 people. Other NGOs, including Friends of the Earth and the Center for Food Safety, also oppose genetically engineered food. The Consumers Union wants that food labeled. All of them argue that US government regulation of genetically modified crops is inadequate. This is a problem for McDonald's – and for anyone who believes that genetic engineering has the potential to increase crop yields, help solve environmental problems or deliver healthier foods. Simplot's new potato varieties, which have been branded as Innate potatoes, are designed to deliver both environmental and health benefits. They reduce black spots from bruising, which cause a portion of each year's potato crop to go to waste as unmarketable. They are also intended to make fried potatoes safer by lowering levels of asparagine, a naturally occurring amino acid that reacts with sugars at high temperatures to produce acrylamide, a potential carcinogen. ""Through the endless possibilities of Innate technology, we aspire to create better fruits and vegetables, farming and human health,"" Haven Baker, Simplot's vice president of plant sciences, told Biotechnology Fortified, an independent non-profit blog about genetic engineering. A pivotal moment from GMOs The brouhaha over Innate potatoes, which are awaiting regulatory approval, comes at a pivotal moment for genetically engineered food in the US. State-by-state battles over mandatory labeling of GMO food has pitted some NGOs and businesses against biotech companies, grocery stores and food and beverage firms like Coca-Cola and Kellogg's. Meanwhile, companies seeking regulatory approval for genetically modified salmon and apples have run into opposition not just from NGOs, but also from conventional apple growers and retailers like Whole Foods Market. If the GMO potatoes, salmon and apples all fail in the marketplace, companies will be loathe to invest further in plant biotechnology. As it happens, this isn't the first time a biotech company has tried to improve the lowly potato. In l998, Monsanto introduced NewLeaf potatoes, which were engineered to repel a pest called the Colorado potato beetle. (Michael Pollan planted some, and wrote a long story about his experience.) Several years later, Monsanto withdrew from the potato business after anti-GMO activists persuaded McDonald's and Frito-Lay to tell their suppliers, including Simplot, not to grow NewLeaf potatoes. This time, McDonald's may be inclined to accept the new-and-improved potatoes because of the environmental and health benefits they promise to deliver. The company declined an interview request, but a spokeswoman told The Guardian that McDonald's decision would be guided by ""food, industry and regulatory experts"". If that's so, the decision should be straightforward, given the broad scientific consensus in the US that the genetically engineered crops currently on the market are safe to eat. What's more, McDonald's supply chain already includes other food made from genetically engineered crops. There are the soybeans that go into its oil, the corn that sweetens its Coke, and the soy and corn that feed the cows that become burgers. About 93% of the soybeans and 85% of the corn grown in the US are genetically modified, according to the USDA. Why all the fuss? Why, then, are the Innate potatoes attracting so much attention? Critics worry that the potatoes are modified using a technology called RNA interference, or RNAi, to effectively silence the genes that instigate browning. ""There is so little known or understood about this technology,"" says Dana Perls, food and technology policy campaigner for Friends of the Earth US. ""We need to slow down."" More broadly, critics claim that neither companies nor government regulators can be trusted to thoroughly assess the safety of biotech foods. ""As of now, there's no requirement for an independent third-party assessment of the risks to human health of this new RNAi technology,"" Michael Hansen, a senior staff scientist at Consumers Union, told me. ""This is new science and we need regulation that is appropriate."" But Simplot's Haven Baker says the USDA will conduct a thorough environmental review and that an FDA review now underway is expected to deliver ""an important endorsement of food safety."" ""Simplot's extensive testing shows these potatoes have the same nutrients, taste, and appearance as conventional potato varieties, which have been proven safe over many years,"" Baker says. Sorting through these claims and counter-claims about the risks and benefit of genetic engineering is difficult, even for an informed layman. That's one of the problems with the GMO debate: It gets emotional very quickly and often comes down to questions of trust. Here the anti-GMO forces have an advantage. They can position themselves as consumer advocates – public interest groups, if you will. By comparison, the companies that favor GMOs are seen as self-interested and lacking credibility. Government regulators also, generally, don't inspire trust. Still, the fact remains that Americans consume genetically engineered food every day, and no adverse health effects attributed to genetic engineering have been documented among humans. If McDonald's is guided solely by science, it should embrace Innate potatoes. But business doesn't work that way. For better or worse, consumer attitudes will factor into the company's decision. So is the customer always right when it comes to GMOs? We'll soon find out. Join the community of sustainability professionals and experts.

133,article,sustainable-business/jpmorgan-ancient-wisdom-financial-crises,Guardian Sustainable Business,2013-11-11,Ancient wisdom and new thinking on integrity show how to avoid financial crises,https://gu.com/p/3k8d2,,Ancient wisdom and new thinking on integrity ... how to avoid financial crises,"An inability to see actions and their consequences in the context of a broader system led to the financial crisis. Being-centred leadership can address this blindness, writes Ram Nidumolu",986,"The likely $13bn (£8.9bn) fine imposed on JPMorgan by the US government has created a lot of buzz recently. The company was accused of passing off loans underlying mortgage-backed securities as low risk to one set of investors, while simultaneously betting with other investors that they were highly risky. It appears that the vast majority of these loans originated from Bear Stearns, acquired in March 2008 by JPMorgan. Ironically, this was done at the behest of the US government to keep the financial system from collapsing. Many other banks are also likely to be implicated in a system so complex that individual actors could not comprehend the global impacts of their risky actions. As a recent Guardian Sustainable Business article points out, the resulting loss of credibility for banks is so severe that trust has now become a vital but scarce capital for modern banking. These kinds of practices are examples of what may be called ""whole blindness"" – the inability or unwillingness to see actions and their consequences in the larger context of the system they affect. Whole blindness shows itself in three key ways Firstly, through a lack of transparency. There is a lack of disclosure of the complete set of material information needed by others to make a decision. Secondly, in economic ""rent seeking"". Here there isn't net wealth creation as a whole; instead, wealth is created for one set of people by taking it away from others. Finally, there is a lack of cognitive bandwidth, the lack of cognitive ability to comprehend the systemic impacts of individual actions. ""Whole blindness"" is a disease that makes business unsustainable. Integrated reporting and natural capital valuation are corporate responses to this disease. ""Whole blindness"" manifests itself as a lack of integrity. Even as the public's trust in the integrity of financial institutions has eroded over the years, financial economists have traditionally been hesitant to study integrity. After all, how does one quantify something commonly defined as ""the quality or state of being of sound moral principle: uprightness, honesty, and sincerity""? But more recently, the eminent financial economist Mike Jensen of the Harvard Business School has argued that integrity seen as wholeness or completeness is a more viable definition. It does not get into the troublesome normative judgments that a definition based on ""sound moral principle"" entails. I expect that this new work will rapidly gather momentum, since it offers researchers a positive way ahead. Interestingly, integrity seen as the wholeness of an entity was a key feature of our ancient wisdom traditions. The word itself is derived from the Latin integritas, which means ""wholeness, completeness, entirety."" When an entity was not whole or complete, it was unstable and would collapse because of a lack of integrity. The lessons from our ancient traditions for the financial practices that caused the financial crisis are clear: a lack of wholeness in these practices led to a lack of integrity, which resulted in a breakdown of the system. In ancient wisdom traditions, the search for wholeness was so important that it extended to the unifying principle behind the different forms of existence in the world. This quest for the ""existence principle"" was defined as a quest for ""being"", of which wholeness or completeness was a key feature. In fact, ""being"" was often referred to as the ""whole"", because it could help us fully understand the nature of existence itself. Like all other great quests, this search for ""being"" was very difficult to fulfill. Nevertheless, the journey itself led to greater integrity, or completeness, within the seeker. The concept of ""being"" is relevant to modern society because it transcends religious, spiritual, agnostic, atheistic, and other beliefs through its focus on the irrefutable fact of existence itself. Because of it, we call ourselves human beings, not doings. As another recent Guardian Sustainable Business article described, global tech firms are turning to such wisdom to increase mindfulness, happiness and sustainability in their employees. Being-centered leadership offers a way forward for addressing problems of integrity in modern financial institutions. It combines our wisdom traditions with modern financial research on integrity to describe how business leaders can lead from a place of seeking to realise ""being"" in their work. Inspired by this quest, being-centered leaders will naturally seek to address the disease of whole blindness. Consider the example of Jeremy Grantham, the co-founder of the GMO Fund with around $150bn in assets directed at sustainable investing. I consider him to be a being-centered leader in the financial services industry because of his conscious efforts to address ""whole blindness"" in his investments. His message is that our modern economic system is unsustainable because human beings don't understand the perils of compounded growth over long durations. Grantham gives a fascinating example from a discussion he had had with experts who would presumably know the effects of year-after-year growth in material output. ""To point to the ludicrous unsustainability of this compound growth I suggested that we imagine the Ancient Egyptians ... whose gods, pharaohs, language, and general culture lasted for well over 3,000 years. Starting with only a cubic meter of physical possessions … I asked how much physical wealth they would have had 3,000 years later at 4.5% compounded growth. In fact, not one of these potential experts came within one billionth of 1% of the actual number … a number so vast that it could not be squeezed into a billion of our solar systems … If trained mathematicians get it so wrong, how can an ordinary specimen of Homo Sapiens have a clue?"" It is the problem of ""whole blindness"" that Grantham points to. If our ancient wisdom traditions are correct, Being-centered leadership could be its cure. Ram Nidumolu is the the COO of Blu Skye Consulting. His new book (Two Birds in a Tree: Timeless Indian Wisdom for Business Leaders), introduces Being-centered leadership as a way to integrate the wisdom traditions with sustainable business",,0.08084142394822005

This freaks out some consumers, like you, who believe these ""hidden"" GMs pose a health risk and may cause allergies.

135,article,commentisfree/2013/nov/06/genetically-modified-food-safe-monsanto,Opinion,2013-11-06,GMOs aren't the problem. Our industrial food system is | Richard Schiffman,https://gu.com/p/3k6qc,Opinion,GMOs aren't the problem. Our industrial food system is,"Food activists should move on from genetically modified foods, and focus on Monsanto and 'Big Ag's' other destructive practices",1522,"The Washington state initiative to label genetically modified foods appears to have been defeated, although Politico reports that, with most of the votes still uncounted, it may be days before we are 100% sure of the final outcome. We've seen this drill before – in California last year – an initially popular referendum to require labeling went down in a narrow defeat after the food and agriculture industries lavished tens of millions of dollars on TV ads claiming that labeling would raise the price of groceries for consumers. Critics call foods made from GMOs (genetically modified organisms) ""frankenfoods"", evoking images of sinister scientists cobbling together vegetable monsters in their laboratories. It doesn't help that the key purveyor of genetic engineering is Monsanto, recently voted ""the most evil corporation in the world"", beating out by a wide margin bad players like BP and Halliburton, in a survey of 16,000 readers of the website ""Natural News"". Genetic scientists at corporations like Monsanto splice genes from one organism into the DNA of another in order to produce certain desired traits in the offspring. Breeders, of course, have been creating new crops for centuries by cross-breeding different strains of the same plant species. Until the development of genetic engineering, however, we could not combine genes from biologically dissimilar organisms. This technology, with its virtually limitless capacity to redesign life, is understandably scary to many people. Over 90% of Americans – Republicans and Democrats virtually equally – want to see GMOs labelled. And if they are labelled, there is little doubt that many consumers will simply stop buying the products, as has already happened in much of Europe. The first GMOs were created in the laboratory during the 1970s, but they weren't widely marketed until the introduction of Bt potatoes, corn and cotton in the mid-1990s. In these crops, genetic material from the bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) bacterium, a micro-organism that produces its own insecticide, is inserted into plant DNA to make them toxic to insects. In some respects, Bt is an environmental success story. It has slashed the use of toxic agrichemicals and boosted productivity for many farmers. Monsanto's best-selling Roundup Ready crops, however, are another story. These plants have been genetically engineered to withstand repeated dousing by the insecticide Roundup (a trade name for glyphosate), which is currently being sprayed on over 100m acres in the Midwest alone. This relentless chemical dousing has led to the recent spread of ""superweeds"" that have developed a resistance to Roundup, forcing farmers to use even more toxic poisons, like 2,4-D – an ingredient of the Vietnam War defoliant Agent Orange – and Dicamba in order to control them. Bt and Roundup are like the good cop and the bad cop of the GMO world. The former has been a boon to farmers and the land that they farm, the later is now turning out to be a poison-spewing curse. But what most people are concerned about is not so much the environmental impact of GMOs as the perceived health risks from eating them. Many are convinced that these foods are unnatural, and that they are leading to epidemics of all sorts of illnesses, like allergies and immune disorders. Is this in fact the case? Monsanto assures us that GMOs are safe. The FDA has ruled that they are substantially equivalent to conventionally grown varieties. But we don't have to take either the FDA or Big Ag's word for it. There are now thousands of independent research studies published by unaffiliated scientists on the safety of genetically modified foods. And the scientific consensus is increasingly clear: there is no convincing evidence that GMOs are any more likely to be harmful than conventionally bred varieties. Frankly this surprises me. I initially assumed that a process as seemingly invasive as genetic engineering would create harmful rogue proteins. In a Guardian piece last year, I wrote of research in England that purportedly showed that food allergies spiked after GMO soy was introduced to England. It turns out that the study was bogus. The rise in allergies had begun long before the genetically modified soy was even in British supermarkets. There are other studies that GMO critics cite as evidence that these foods may be harmful. But virtually all of these studies have been shown to be seriously flawed – not by corporations like Monsanto, but by neutral scientists who have evaluated them. Moreover, there are reams of independent research indicating that currently available forms of genetically modified foods are safe to eat. As I write these words, I know that some readers will dismiss them. Many are thoroughly convinced that there is a conspiracy afoot to suppress the news that GMOs are destroying our health. They are not interested in what science has to say, if it contradicts their preconceived ideological position. But I urge those who are interested in learning more to take a look at Nathaniel Johnson's frightfully smart series of articles on GMOs in the online environmental publication Grist. Johnson, a green journalist in good standing and no corporate shill, concludes, after exhaustively combing through the science, that genetically modified foods are safe. Or as safe as anything is nowadays. He says: I'm much more comfortable feeding my daughter Bt corn than corn sprayed with organophosphates, that's for sure. There are a whole lot of dangers out there. People are becoming obese in record numbers from quaffing refined foods and sugary drinks. Diabetes rates are soaring. Heart disease, osteoporosis, even certain types of cancer are on the rise, arguably at least in part because of our nutrient poor diets. But nobody has yet demonstrated that GMOs make us sick. Does this mean that we don't have to be vigilant? I think not. Margaret Smith, the Associate Director, of Cornell's Agricultural Experiment Station, told me that whenever a new crop variety is developed, there is a risk that it will contain toxic proteins. This is true for conventional breeding, she says, even more than with GMOs, because cross-breeding is a messy business. It mixes thousands of genes promiscuously together with thousands of others – producing a staggering number of possible recombinations. Genetic engineering, by contrast, is actually a far cleaner process, which surgically inserts just one carefully selected gene into an already existing chromosome. That doesn't mean that it won't ever create novel toxins – all forms of breeding have got this risky potential. And that's why we need to test new varieties rigorously for safety. Smith cites the case of a conventionally bred potato, which contained high levels of glycoalkaloids that were dangerous to eat. Fortunately, breeders tested the potatoes before marketing them and caught this problem in time. The same kind of self-policing can work with genetically modified foods as well, she argues. I also interviewed Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition and public health at New York University who is known as an outspoken critic of America's food system. She told me: I'm trained in molecular biology and have a hard time thinking that [GMOs] will make people sick. What Nestle worries about are not GMOs, so much as the chemical-intensive farming methods used to grow them. We're cutting down the Amazon to grow soybeans to feed beef cattle. Industrial agriculture is degrading the soil and depleting our diminishing groundwater reserves. And as we have already seen, it puts farmers on a madcap chemical treadmill in which they need to use cocktails of ever more deadly toxins to grow our food. This is not just unhealthy, it is unsustainable in the long run – whether the seeds planted are genetically modified or not is beside the point. Food activists have been focused for a long time on the Boogeyman of GMOs, and their poster boy Monsanto, which have served as easy-to-identify focal points for our fears and angers. I know where they are coming from; I, too, think that Monsanto is a corporate bully that has put its own bottom line above the good of the planet. But having said that, I also believe that trying to eliminate genetic engineering is a fool's errand – this genie is not going back into the bottle anytime soon. Furthermore, the struggle against GMOs is at best fighting the symptom, while ignoring the disease. The disease is humanity's abuse of nature. The disease is the factory farming on steroids that is poisoning and exhausting the natural systems that we humans depend on for our survival. The problem with genetically modified foods is not that they are genetically modified; it is that they have been designed to become cogs in the machine of this destructive system. It is the system that needs to change, not the seeds. So I have a small request for my food activist and environmentalist friends: let's take yesterday's Washington vote as a signal to move on. The same passion that has been expended in fighting a technology which is here to stay needs to be used to address the real challenges that confront our planet. With climate change breathing down our necks and arable land and other key resources in increasingly short supply, we simply can't afford to be sidetracked any longer into this fruitless battle against GMOs.",,0.0647478942246384
136,article,commentisfree/2013/oct/31/tasmania-gm-crops,Opinion,2013-10-31,Should Tasmania stay GM-free?,https://gu.com/p/3k259,Opinion,Should Tasmania stay GM-free?,The state has a moratorium on genetically modified crops &ndash; and its farmers have some difficult choices to make about whether or not it should be lifted,1109,"At Thorpe Farm, in the midlands near Bothwell, Tasmania’s agricultural past and future coexist. Convict labourers cut the channels that feed Australia’s oldest working water mill. The thrumming millstone still produces highest-grade flour. Alongside the antique mill, the farm’s proprietors, the Bignells, use advanced agronomy techniques to cultivate wool, lamb, pork, opium poppies, horseradish, garlic and flour. Their markets are international and brutally competitive. Every possible growing advantage must be eked out. Now, in order to maintain their toehold, the Bignells are considering the promise of gene technology. Tasmania has a moratorium on genetically modified (GM) crops, which is currently under review. The state government is expected to extend the ban when it hands down its decision later this year. The prospect of a GM-free Tasmania, driving innovation in niche production may be a good reason to reject GM crops. But the public debate is degraded by subjectivity, sophistry and an instinctive mistrust of science. “The biggest issue we’ve got with GMO is it’s an emotive position”, says Will Bignell. “It’s a bit like a religion, it’s very hard to sway someone from their initial position. I believe 90% of the debate isn’t based on rational decisions. It’s a pre-formed emotive position.” Few subjects are more quickly railroaded into morality than GM. Many feel instinctively uncomfortable about this technology – and who controls it. These are vital issues for us to talk about as a society. But valid reservations are often cloaked in pseudoscientific assertions that all GM technology does not work or is unsafe for consumers. The biotech industry pursues its own agenda through the GM PR machine, which is lead by industry cheerleader Croplife. Funded by BASF, Bayer CropScience, Dow AgroSciences, DuPont, FMC Corp, Monsanto, Sumitomo and Syngenta, Croplife publicises studies that back up industry claims about GM’s efficacy and safety. The sheer volume of questionable and contradictory research makes GM science difficult to navigate. Bignell, who holds a PhD in molecular biology, agrees: “There’s a lot of what I call chaff in amongst the facts and that’s what science teaches you to dig through. The middle ground is the hardest ground to find. But for me, I genuinely think there are advantages in GMO technology.” Bignell debunks the suggestion that the crops don’t work with the simple logic of the land: “If GM crops yield less, why do people buy it? Are farmers that stupid? The message that that argument gives me is: I’m a dipshit.” Not all farmers have PhDs and they are subjected to intense industry lobbying, but Bignell’s point is a good one. Worldwide, 17 million farmers planted GM crops last year – not all of them are dupes. If the anti-GM movement treats growers with disrespect it will quickly lose more of them to the biotech industry. Another emotive furphy is the skull and crossbones image attached to GM crops. There seems to be a fairly clear and reasonable consensus that GM technology is not inherently dangerous. But anyone who says that there is a scientific consensus that all GM technology is safe is wrong. There is no single entity called GM. Each crop is a novel technology and must be tested and found to be safe (or otherwise) as it is produced. The biotech industry often quotes experts who say there have been no recorded incidents of ill health resultant from GM crops. This does not mean it will never happen. Australian states are restricted by federal law from rejecting GM crops on the basis of concerns about the environment or health of their citizens. This is the province of the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OTGR). Instead, Tasmania and South Australia have successfully challenged the technology on the basis that it will harm their export and tourism brands. Federal Senator Lin Thorp has led the push against GM in Tasmania. Thorp was a member of the state government that introduced the moratorium in 2001. She says Tasmania, as an island, can use its isolation and clean environment to “overcome the tyranny of distance and the difficulties of the size of our ventures” by producing GM-free food “that people are prepared to pay a premium for”. There has been little comprehensive research into the market potential of GM-free Tasmanian produce. Consultancy group Macquarie Franklin conducted the only major investigation into the issue in 2012. The study recorded both benefits and losses as a result of the moratorium. Macquarie Franklin noted “intangible” brand benefits for a GM-free Tasmania. But exactly how much value is there in a statewide ban? Do consumers really care if their potatoes come from a state where GM canola is grown (so long as contamination is avoided)? As Thorp said in the Hobart Mercury this month: “We simply can't rely on ""intangibles"" in making this important decision.” The state’s agriculture industry bodies have been mostly united in their support for maintaining the moratorium. Tasmania’s honey growers have threatened to cease crop pollination services if the ban ends because GM contamination will destroy their lucrative European and Asian markets. Tasmania’s dairy farmers are one of the only agricultural blocks pushing for an end to the moratorium. They stand to benefit from the development of high-energy rye grass, which DairyTas say could boost annual productivity by up to $200 per hectare. The grass remains two to five years away, but this is still closer than other technologies. Farmers have not taken an ideological position on GM. They have simply judged that there is little short-term advantage for them in abolishing the GM moratorium now. Australia-wide the OGTR has only granted approval to herbicide-resistant canola and cotton, and cotton does not grow in Tasmania. As new crops become available more farmers will seek to abandon the GM-free church. Bignell will be one of those. He favours a temporary extension of the moratorium because some of his crops (around 20% of his income) attract a premium for being GM-free. But he doesn’t foresee any market advantage for his wool, lamb and poppies. In fact he thinks the poppy industry will eventually move offshore if GM technology is not made available. In the end, he says he can’t see a conflict between growing GM poppies beside GM-free horseradish. The water still turns the mill at Thorpe Farm, but the ancient technology survives under no grace but its own utility. There is little room for sentimentality on the land. Farmers deserve a rigorous and honest GM debate. To allow an instinctive mistrust of science to inform the argument will drive them into the arms of the biotech lobby. Any extended moratorium should see Tasmania attempt to construct a compelling economic case for staying GM-free. Then, if it exists, we must support agriculturalists to prosper from it.",,0.07579305745424166

Stein, an agricultural economist with the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington, DC, who did his PhD on the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of Golden Rice has been actively involved in today's Twitter debate and sent in this late addition. A lot of the discussion about Golden Rice – which is directly conflated with the commercial development and cultivation of GM crops in western countries – boils down to money: How much profit do private corporations derive from GMOs? What kind of ownership rights do companies get over agricultural crops? Do farmers benefit from the cultivation of GM crops? What is in it for consumers? How much public money should be spent on research and development of GM crops, and on what kind of crops? etc. Earlier this year I addressed the question of what the best use of public resources is when it comes to micronutrient interventions, and how the impact and cost-effectiveness of Golden Rice can be assessed in comparison with other interventions and across different time horizons. The key conclusion is that Golden Rice offers a very promising intervention that could complement other current interventions, above all supplementation with vitamin A pills, in a cost-effective way. That is, Golden Rice could help reach people who fall through the cracks of current interventions and it could reduce overall spending on vitamin A interventions, thus freeing up scarce resources in the fields of public health and nutrition in developing countries. To also address this question: Whether genetic engineering is more risky than other breeding methods or whether GM crops pose any particular risk has been answered in decades of food safety and biosafety research in hundreds of studies: it is not. Therefore, while Minister Paterson may have used bold language and was optimistic regarding the time frame in which Golden Rice can have an impact, his overall message is true, namely that Golden Rice could help save the lives and improve the health and well-being of children and pregnant women across large parts of Asia, that there is no particular risk connected to GM crops as such and that, consequently, opponents of Golden Rice place their larger political agenda above the lives and health of poor people elsewhere. People who disagree with the framework in which GM crops are developed and used in the western world should target this framework, be it the promotion of weaker patent rights, the facilitation of more competition in the field of agricultural biotechnology to reduce the market power of the incumbents or the support of more public and humanitarian research, but they should not throw out the (vitamin A deficient) baby with the bath water. This has been a challenging and forthright debate with, so far as I can tell, right and wrong on both sides. My personal view on golden rice is that, as a technology with potential to alleviate some degree of suffering in the developing world, it must be treated with respect. But the debate about this crop has long become divorced from the rice itself. It is now compromised by the rolling rancour surrounding the politics of GM food. There are a couple of points of divergence about golden rice that I think can be cleared up here. Firstly, golden rice seems genuinely open source in regards to its patent ownership. If it proves to be useful in counteracting malnutrition it will not simply feed into the agri-capital combine. I don't see any reason to disbelieve the project on this. However if you have evidence to the contrary then please email me. Secondly, regardless of interference from Greenpeace and others, golden rice remains a very long way from the developing world's dinner plate. The science and the regulatory process still have a long way to go. The reasons for this distance to their goal are legion. Mostly it is because this type of research takes time. But the process has been complicated because golden rice has become a lightning rod for a set of interest groups that run the gambit from development, to environment, to morality. The effect this has had on the research has been profound. At every step scientists have been exposed to a level of scrutiny and public interest that outweighs the relevance of this (so far unproven) project. As Sally Brooks says, this is not an environment conducive to open, efficient research. But the assertion that the delay of golden rice is wicked, places Owen Paterson on shaky ground. First of all, it has no basis in science. As I have said, the effectiveness of golden rice has not been proven, so the claim that lives could have been lost is entirely speculative. Further, the co-option of the project as a poster child for GM tech has placed the scientists in the project under duress and compromised the work they are attempting to do. This should not be read as a defence or otherwise of anti-GM groups. The idea that golden rice is a trojan horse to soften the ground for a barrage of GM technologies may have some truth. But should that cause us to ignore it completely? That seems irresponsible. Rather it should lead us to discussions and awareness of how we manage this type of technology's ownership and control it for the benefit of those who truly need it. Thankyou to everyone who contributed today. I will be back with another eco audit next week. *Please note that I have changed this article to say that golden rice is still a long way from developing world people because of the long regulatory process and some science still to be completed and not, as I originally said, because the science alone is lacking. The Guardian's environment editor John Vidal, whose news piece about this is now online, has just sent me some comment of his own: The last few weeks have seen a remarkable number of favourable articles about golden rice, a product that has not been fully tested and is certainly is not for sale yet. They mostly say how many children it could save and blame Greenpeace and western NGOs for delaying for as much as 12 years the commercialisation of the rice variety across Asia. But where does this enmity to Greenpeace, a mere non-government group, without much influence in the Asian corridors of power, come from? The origins of the row seem to go back to 2000 when Time magazine claimed, “This rice could save a million kids a year.” Then, in February this year, the “reluctant environmentalist” Bjorn Lomborg claimed that “in the last 12 years, about 8 million kids have died from Vitamin A deficiency. He asked, pointedly: ""Are anti-GM advocates not at least partially responsible?” Fast forward to August 2013 when the journal Scientific American argued that Greenpeace and other anti-GMO organisations were using “misinformation and hysteria to delay the introduction of Golden Rice to the Philippines, India and China”. This was followed in September with 11 senior scientists saying in US Science journal that golden rice should be allowed : “If ever there was a clear-cut cause for outrage, it is the concerted campaign by Greenpeace and other nongovernmental organisations, as well as by individuals, against Golden Rice”, they said. After that we had US controversialist and former Greenpeace activist-turned-virulent-critic Patrick Moore setting up a new campaign group Allow Golden Rice Now! Moore accused Greenpeace and its allies of killing 8 million children by delaying the introduction of the rice into SE Asia. Then on October 5. Moore and British pro GM campaigner Mark Lynas appeared on the Today programme claiming that Greenpeace and its allies were “blocking the cure”. But what exactly is the evidence that Greenpeace or any other western did actually manage to delay its introduction? The spat seems to go back to 2008 when Tufts university researchers from Boston, backed by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), conducted a human trial of Golden Rice on a group of 24 boys and girls in Hunan province, China. This was published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition and was spotted by Greenpeace, who told the Chinese authorities. A mighty furore ensued after it emerged that not all the parents of the children knew it was GM rice. But even this was not the end of the story. On September 18, after a one year investigation, Tufts university took the highly unusual step of barring the principal investigator from doing any further human research for 2 years and admitted flaws in the study. The backers of golden rice were, to say the least, highly embarrassed and Greenpeace, from being an irritant, became the devil incarnate. You could surmise that the scientific Establishment has been rounded up not just to promote golden rice, but to defend US science itself. Patrick Moore left his reply in the thread later this evening: Sally Brooks, a York University social researcher specialising in international development, technological change in agriculture and food policy, spoke to me about her research into golden rice. For those who want to do some background reading, Brooks conducted a study on the lessons to be learned for biofortification projects from the golden rice experience. Brooks said the technology still required an enormous amount of research to be done in order to be able to assess its potential to save lives. Notably, she said the main obstacles that lie in front of the science were not the anti-GM lobby or regulation, but the simple technical difficulty of producing the crop. She said yesterday was not the first time Owen Paterson had referred to the golden rice project's moral imperative. In a Radio 4 Today Programme interview in June this year, Paterson said: ""Over the last 15 years … every attempt to deploy this golden rice has been thwarted. And in that time, seven million children have gone blind or died."" In a blogpost in June, Brooks said the co-option of the golden rice project into the wider GM debate (by both sides) had hindered the genuine attempts of scientists to study the potential of this crop: The decision to back GM crops was presented as a matter of life and death... The implication was clear - those who had ‘thwarted’ attempts to deploy a life-saving technology bore some responsibility for this tragic outcome. Such people, Paterson suggested, ""should really reflect"". This is not the first time that the specific case of the Golden Rice project has been deployed as the lynchpin of an argument for policy and regulatory changes to accelerate the commercialisation on GM crops in general. This is problematic for a number of reasons which I have set out in a new article. As well as bringing more heat than light to an already overheated debate, the deployment of Golden Rice as ‘poster child’ in the GM crop debate has had serious consequences for the way the research has been carried out ‘on the ground’ over the years. In research stations in Southeast Asia, the pressure cooker environment surrounding the project has not been conducive to the kind of open discussion and debate – among crop scientists, nutritionists, public health experts, and others – that an ambitious research effort such as this warrants and requires. Unfortunately, too much hype ‘upstream’ has tended to close down opportunities for open scientific enquiry and debate ‘downstream’, just where it is most needed. A recent statement issued by the International Rice Research Institute, based in the Philippines (due to be the first country to commercialise Golden Rice) was therefore an important moment in the history of the project. Why was it so important? Because it stated, unambiguously, what is still a key unknown – whether Golden Rice will actually improve the nutritional status of malnourished children and adults. Moreover, it states clearly that the remaining stages of the project, which include both regulatory assessment and nutrition studies to establish whether Golden Rice does indeed have potential to prevent malnutrition-induced child blindness and mortality, will take ‘two years or more’. It is important, therefore, that at this critical stage in the project, the researchers and their partners in the Philippines are able to complete these studies – and, most importantly, openly share their results, whatever the outcome – unencumbered by inflated expectations and claims generated in support of the adoption of agricultural biotechnologies elsewhere. In the meantime, the GM crop debate in the UK would surely be better served by evidence sourced much closer to home. A further piece by Brooks raises the issue that again, the cart has been put in front of the horse. An important but less well understood dimension of the controversy was the transfer of the outputs of public sector research to a private company, Syngenta, in exchange for assistance in negotiating unanticipated intellectual property restrictions. The inventors and their new sponsors presented this transfer of ownership in wholly positive terms, however, heralding the creation of a ‘new type of public-private partnership’ which allowed free transfer of patented technologies to public institutions in developing countries, who would then be able to adapt and disseminate the new, nutrient-dense varieties to resource-poor farmers in South and Southeast Asia. In 2002, the Golden Rice materials were transferred to the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines. A ‘Humanitarian Board’, which included the inventors, donors (including the Rockefeller Foundation) and a Syngenta representative, had by then issued a ‘humanitarian license’ enabling IRRI and its partners to begin the time consuming task of ‘back-crossing’ the Golden Rice ‘trait’ into Indica varieties that grow in tropical climates in Southeast Asia. By 2008, IRRI scientists had stabilised germplasm ready for open field trials. The BMGF joined the Golden Rice project as a co-funder in 2003. Despite a lack of evidence at the time of the effectiveness of ‘bio-fortified’ (nutritionally enhanced) crops in combatting malnutrition, the Foundation took a ‘leap of faith’ and funded a series of ‘biofortification’ initiatives, including the Golden Rice project. Following completion of the field trials in 2011, the BMGF announced a further $10m in funding for long-awaited nutritional testing and preparation for regulatory assessment in the Philippines and Bangladesh. These activities are still ongoing. Nevertheless, a consistent theme running through Golden Rice project communications over the years has been an emphasis on the institutionalconstraints and achievements, which has diverted attention from the faltering progress of the research itself. The celebration of the project as a ‘new type of public-private partnership’, as the only way forward in negotiating the ‘maze’ of patents, is a case in point. Juxtaposed against the success story of a ‘humanitarian license’ facilitating access to a patented technology was a more negative story of regulatory hurdles standing between the technology and its beneficiaries. In this context, Golden Rice was afforded a very different, ‘virtual’ identity in policy and public discourse as a symbol of the thwarted promise of GM crops. In contrast to its messy reality as experimental material in the laboratory and greenhouse, Golden Rice was reconstructed as a proven technology and answer to vitamin A deficiency, which, but for unnecessarily burdensome biosafety regulation and irrational opposition, would already be in farmers’ fields and saving lives. Adrian Dubock from the Golden Rice Project sent me this response to Brook's words: She is however a little out of date. Elsewhere in the blog chain I have quoted a number of the key findings about Golden Rice and its potential. She seems unaware of Tang et al 2012 for example. And she also leaves the wrong impression about the publicity sought by the humanitarian Golden Rice project. To my (pretty good) knowledge of the history there have only been ever three (maybe four) press releases relating to it, two (or three) by Syngenta in 2001 and 2004/5, and one by IRRI &amp; Gates Foundation announcing a Gates Foundation grant to IRRI for Golden Rice work, which only started in December 2010. Indeed the Humanitarian Board took an early decision not to talk about the project until there was something to report. Sally Brooks mentions Golden Rice being funded by Gates from 2003. That is incorrect. In 2005 Gates Foundation as part of it’s Grand Challenges in Global Health competitively awarded a grant to Prof Peter Beyer’s University of Freiburg (Germany) laboratory to investigate with collaborators making Golden Rice more nutritionally biofortified. There has been a tremendous volume of excellent responses in the comment thread. I will include some of the best below but I recommend a thorough read. If anything it highlights the way the debate about golden rice is co-opted into larger GM debates – with all the requisite misunderstandings. This debate is a real Pandora's box. I have the feeling that a number of issues are being conflated and the golden rice project is a little ship embroiled in a much bigger storm. I asked Adrian Dubock, the executive secretary of the Golden Rice Humanitarian Board, who has been contributing enormously in the comment thread, whether he felt that the golden rice project's aims had been compromised by big agriculture's championing of the project. It attracts more incoming fire, than if it wasn't like that. But on the other hand it has been quietly being murdered by opponents anyway. It's come to be a poster boy and it has occurred on a number of occasions in its history and actually not as a result of anything that the actual project has done but because others have found it a useful example which does undermine the normal arguments."" We also spoke at length about golden rice's patent history. He told me that about half a dozen companies held patent rights to technologies used in golden rice. But at the advent of the research, he and its inventors convinced all of these companies to waive their proprietary claims to the technology. On the anti-GM campaign he said: It seems to come down to major distrust of capitalism and commercial interests. But there is no hidden commercial interest in this project and indeed I wish there was more because I might get paid."" Luke Owen, a researcher at Coventry University tweeted in about the conflation of golden rice with the larger GM debate. I do agree with his sentiment. We need to be talking implementation and control of this technology, if it does prove to be a workable proposition. Owen subsequently emailed me regarding this debate: The Golden Rice debate, as pointed out by several contributors, is a prime example of the 'difficult' ethical questions about how best to transform contemporary agro-food systems for the better. While I do not intend to comment on the specific merits of Golden Rice or to become entangled with a debate about the ethics of GM foods, it is important that we recognise the shortfalls of current systems and structures in which our food commodities are situated. Indeed, a crucial part of the debate is not whether Golden Rice should be made widely available based on its scientific merits, but rather it is about access. For example, how seed could be supplied, distributed and regulated on a sustainable basis and incorporated into people's lives as part of a sustainable, varied and balanced diet. Regardless of the ethics behind Golden Rice or other GM crops, what really matters is there exists a democratic, diverse and sustainable system of food provision that serves the interests and livelihoods of developing world small-scale food producers and citizens; and not those of large corporate agri-business. There are a number of people in the comment thread and on Twitter who seem to think golden rice is tied up in large agribusiness interests. It is my understanding that this is not the case. Adrian Dubock is the executive secretary of the Golden Rice Humanitarian Board. He has posted in the comment thread below. In the comment thread Martin, from www.thesnufkin.blogspot.com, has spoken about about his transition from Greenpeace saboteur to tentative golden rice supporter. As someone who's done the crop trashing thing I now qualify my opposition to GM."" The Guardian's Claire Provost has sent over a few lines about the context of Paterson's remarks. This weekend saw anti-GM protests held across the world. On Saturday a group of anti-GM demonstrators took to the streets in Des Moines, Iowa, to protest against the World Food Prize which this year includes Monsanto chief technology office Dr. Robert Fraley among its awardees. A series of other events are planned this week under the banner: ""Occupy the World Food Prize"". Sometimes called the Nobel Prize for Agriculture, the World Food Prize has been criticised for prioritising biotechnology over other strategies for achieving food security. This year's laureates are: Marc Van Montagu, professor emeritus at the Institute of Plant Biotechnology for Developing Countries at Ghent University in Belgium; Mary-Dell Chilton, founder of Syngenta Biotechnology; and Robert Fraley. An alternative award, the Food Sovereignty Prize, is given by civil society groups to highlight work which puts ""the right to sufficient, healthy and culturally appropriate food for all at the center of food, agriculture, livestock and fisheries policies."" The World Development Movement (WDM) have released a statement which questions Paterson's motives and mandate to comment on what they say is a development issue. For the record, when I called Paterson's Defra press office this morning they said he had been commenting in a private capacity. But WDM suggest he is motivated by the British government's agribusiness concerns. Owen Paterson has grabbed the headlines again, this time for accusing environmental groups opposed to GM crops of being “wicked”, potentially condemning millions of people in the global south to premature death. Before even considering the claim, we should consider who is making it. Paterson is the head of the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). He doesn’t work in international development. So why this concern for citizens of developing countries? It turns out that Defra, along with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and the Department for International Development (DfID) have a joint ‘agricultural technology’ strategy which is very much about promoting UK agribusiness interests – including in new markets overseas – and very little about (in fact, diametrically opposed to) a just and sustainable food system. If we were concerned about a food system which prioritised people’s need, we would need a radically different distribution of power and resources. As we all know, there’s more than enough food to feed the world’s population – the problem is access. Malnutrition in the global south is almost exclusively a result of people’s inability to access enough food, or a sufficiently varied diet. The way to solve it is to improve incomes – not to hand power to the multinationals that already control our food system, further squeezing producers and forcing them into an industrial monoculture production that posits Golden Rice as a solution rather than a problem. Already 10 companies control three-quarters of the global seed market, and the current drive for more GM is only likely to result in further concentration. But don’t take it from an NGO. On Saturday, opponents of corporate control of food and seeds took part in demonstrations on every continent. Marches or protests were held in over 20 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, from Ghana and Kenya to Bolivia and Indonesia. This is not about western NGOs pushing an anti-GM line: farmers themselves in the global south are mobilising to reject GM because it means greater agribusiness control over seeds. Pro-corporate legislation is restricting farmers’ rights to breed and exchange seed adapted to their local environment (crucial in the face of climate change) and instead forcing them to purchase new seed each year. African groups reject the agribusiness-friendly initiatives supported by northern governments, such as the G8’s New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition and the Gates-sponsored AGRA (“Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa”) which is handing control of their food systems over to multinationals at the expense of the small-scale producers who feed most of the world’s population. Without a change in direction from the UK government and its allies, we can expect to see more poverty and malnutrition on a global scale, not less. Friends of the Earth director of policy and campaigns Craig Bennett said: Some of the greatest threats to food security include climate change, soil degradation, and a lack of agricultural diversity – and it is highly doubtful that more intensive forms of agriculture such as GM crops will deliver on these issues for farmers or food supply. “Friends of the Earth is not campaigning on golden rice. We are putting our effort into campaigning for tried and tested measures that have been shown to deliver real solutions for farmers and nutrition - such as boosting yields by protecting soils, better water management and affordable access to seeds. “What could be termed as wicked is a Minister who turns a blind eye to evidence of the very real threat of climate change on food security and the world’s children, and instead puts his faith in unproven silver bullet measures.” The GM issue raised its head again in Britain in 2012 when activists threatened to sabotage the Rothamsted Research centre in Hertfordshire. Research into blight-free potatoes was being conducted at the centre. On golden rice, Professor Huw Jones, research group leader at the Centre for Crop Genetic Improvement at Rothamsted, said today: “There are three key issues: Is it safe? Is it effective? And will there be informed choice in the grower/consumer communities? If the answer to all is yes, then it is a no-brainer that golden rice should be part of the solution to malnourishment in Asia. The field trials must be done and let’s let the local communities decide.” There are plenty of people pitching into the twitter debate. Tweet your views to @karlmathiesen. Mark Lynas, an environment campaigner who changed his stripes on the GM issue, managed to relay a few words as he boarded a plane at Heathrow. He said Paterson was correct with his comments on golden rice. Although he said it was the ""wrong person making the right argument"". While large scale production of the crop was not the ultimate solution to the developing world's malnutrition crisis, he said ""we need to try every option in the meantime"". He said the idea the technology was a ""trojan horse"" for GM was a conspiracy theory and that vulnerable children were being ""held to ransom by well-fed westerners"" on the issue. When asked if he agreed with the comments Paterson made yesterday, Lynas said: ""I do. It is anti-human and immoral for the anti-GM lobby to block golden rice on the back of their own superstitions."" The Science Media Centre have emailed in some statements from scientists. Professor Mark Tester, Centre for Desert Agriculture, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia, said: “It is heartening to see that there is a prominent government minister with the bravery and leadership to decry the misguided stance of the anti-GM extremists. Campaigners claim that there are more effective solutions to vitamin A deficiency - but what are these solutions, and why have they not yet materialised to beat the world’s biggest health issue, that of micronutrient deficiencies? “The use of GM to increase the nutritional value of rice provides a unique opportunity, a potential new tool to tackle Vitamin A deficiency. From what I have heard, the best on offer from the anti–GM brigade is that people should just eat their greens.” Professor Joe Perry, chair of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) GMO Panel said: “It is important to recognise that in this, and in the previous speech Owen Patterson made on GM crops, he stressed the importance of safety based on a proper scientific assessment of the risks. He is definitively not suggesting any diminution or relaxing of regulation. What he seems to be suggesting is that decisions on authorisation need to be based on the outcome of the regulatory safety assessment; not, as at present, on political considerations. I see no reason why such a stance should not be supported. “It is strange that certain organistions on the one hand vilify those that go against the scientific consensus on climate change but simultaneously refuse to accept the overwhelming scientific consensus on GM food safety. Any organisation that supports the ripping up of regulatory trials designed to inform us about food or environmental safety is denying the public the data on which to make an informed decision; this goes against all the principles of transparency.” Professor Denis Murphy, head of the Genomics and Computational Biology Research Group at the University of South Wales said: “Golden rice was developed 20 years ago by a Swiss-German group of university researchers and it is now being trialled in The Philippines at the International Rice Research institute – a public crop improvement organisation funded by charities. Golden rice is aimed at poor farmers &amp; their families in Asia where vitamin A deficiency is relatively common. It is not a commercial venture and is not owned by Western multinationals like Monsanto or Bayer. There is much public support for golden rice in Asia but unfortunately some western NGOs have recently influenced local activists to destroy some of the field trials in The Philippines, which is very regrettable. “Interestingly, another form of improved rice called NERICA was developed recently in west Africa by highly artificial cell culture and embryo rescue methods. This produced an unnatural hybrid of two different species that is now feeding millions of poor farmers in West Africa. For some reason there has been no outcry about NERICA despite its unnatural origins whereas golden rice has been stigmatised simply due to its GM origins. “It seems that many critics of golden rice fail to understand that much of modern breeding is very artificial and technology dependent – but without it we would certainly be facing famine on a global scale.” Lobby organisation Allow Golden Rice Now, started by Patrick Moore (a former leader of Greenpeace) have said opposition to golden rice could be characterised as a crime against humanity. We are calling on the countries that are Party to the Rome Protocol to investigate this situation with an eye to taking Greenpeace before the International Criminal Court to answer for their crime against humanity. Interestingly, they make a comment that seems to agree with the 'trojan horse' argument that golden rice will beget further GM technologies. We believe Greenpeace's opposition to Golden Rice is a position held to justify its zero-tolerance approach to genetic modification in general. Greenpeace knows that if there is one good Genetically Modified (GM) variety, there will be others. The organisation would then need to have a rational discussion about the merits of each variety. Instead, it prefers to stand on high in judgment, even though this condemns millions to needless suffering and death. The Golden Rice Project, one of the guiding organisations of the golden rice development has added to the comments below. For some more background on the GM issue, and how adversarial it can be, this short debate between Green party leader Natalie Bennett and Johnjoe McFadden, a professor of molecular genetics at the University of Surrey is worth a watch. Golden rice has been modified to create beta carotene, which human bodies turn into vitamin A. The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) manages research into the crop. The IRRI website says the beta carotene content is unique among rice strains: According to research published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2009, daily consumption of a very modest amount of Golden Rice – about a cup (or around 150 g uncooked weight) – could supply 50% of the Recommended Daily Allowance of vitamin A for an adult. Golden Rice was developed using genetic modification techniques, with genes from maize and a common soil microorganism that together produce beta carotene in the rice grain. Surveys of rice varieties around the world failed to identify any varieties that contain significant amounts of beta carotene, so conventional breeding programs could not be used to develop Golden Rice. Golden Rice was invented by Professor Ingo Potrykus, then of the Institute for Plant Sciences, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, and Professor Peter Beyer of the University of Freiburg, Germany. By 1999, Professor Potrykus and Dr. Beyer produced a prototype Golden Rice and published their landmark research in Science. The inventors’ desire to donate Golden Rice as a gift to resource-poor farmers in developing countries led to a public-private partnership with Syngenta to help further develop Golden Rice. Scientists at Syngenta then carried out additional laboratory, greenhouse, and field research to help raise the beta carotene levels in Golden Rice. In 2005, they developed a new version of Golden Rice that produces substantially more beta carotene than the 1999 prototype - as published in Nature Biotechnology. Syngenta arranged royalty-free access to the patents and intellectual property, held by several biotechnology companies, for a number of key technologies used in Golden Rice. This allows IRRI and others to develop Golden Rice varieties on a non-profit basis. Greenpeace has been critical of the technology since its inception. Their website argues that it has diverted resources and interest away from more realistic, sustainable development solutions: While golden GM rice promised a lot, it has so far delivered absolutely nothing after over 10 years of expensive research. All the hype has come at a price, because there are alternative ways to tackle vitamin A deficiency and they've been undermined by the focus on a silver bullet technology that does not tackle the underlying social and economic drivers behind vitamin A deficiency. Other arguments advanced against golden rice include concerns it will promote an industrial monoculture and undermine small scale farming which provides for varied diets. ""GE rice could, if introduced on a large scale, exacerbate malnutrition and undermine food security because it encourages a diet based on a single industrial staple food rather than upon the re-introduction of the many vitamin-rich food plants with high nutritional value that are cheap and already available,"" says Professor Klaus Becker, from University of Hohenheim, Germany. The other major concern raised about golden rice is that it will somehow soften the ground for large scale acceptance of GM crops. These technologies may not be so philanthropic or open-source as golden rice. Sarojeni Rengam, executive director of Pesticide Action Network Asia, has said: ""Golden Rice is really a ‘Trojan horse’; a public relations stunt pulled by the agribusiness corporations to garner acceptance of GE crops and food. The whole idea of GE seeds is to make money."" George Monbiot wrote with similar sentiments in 2004: The world has a surplus of food, but still people go hungry. They go hungry because they cannot afford to buy it. They cannot afford to buy it because the sources of wealth and the means of production have been captured and in some cases monopolised by landowners and corporations. The purpose of the biotech industry is to capture and monopolise the sources of wealth and the means of production. Now in some places governments or unselfish private researchers are producing GM crops which are free from patents and not dependent on the application of proprietary pesticides, and these could well be of benefit to small farmers in the developing world. But Taverne and the other propagandists are seeking to persuade us to approve a corporate model of GM development in the rich world, in the hope that this will somehow encourage the opposite model to develop in the poor world. The biotech companies are not interested in whether or not science is flourishing or people are starving. They simply want to make money. The best way to make money is to control the market. But before you can control the market, you must first convince the people that there’s something else at stake. UK environment secretary Owen Paterson has continued his recent rhetorical campaign to inflame environmentalists by suggesting in an interview with the Independent that opposition to genetically modified crops designed to feed the developing world is ""wicked"". But while his recent comments about goalpost-moving badgers and the positive aspects of climate change raised almost unanimous ire from both the environment movement and the science community, his latest criticisms raise an issue that finds green groups and some scientists divided. Golden rice has been touted for more than a decade as a potential cure for vitamin A deficiency (VAD). VAD is a major cause of blindness in children. The rice has had genes implanted that cause the production of beta carotene, which gives the rice its distinctive colour. Paterson said: When you think that golden rice has been developed by philanthropists and could have a dramatic impact on children who are going blind from Vitamin A deficiency or dying from Vitamin A deficiency it is absolutely wicked that these environmental groups oppose it. There is no other word for it.” Are there some crops that we cannot afford to leave in the lab? Is golden rice all it purports to be? Or is it a trojan horse for GM-tech, as some green groups suggest? You too can help with the investigation. Please write your thoughts in the comments below, tweet me, or email me.

138,article,sustainable-business/chipotle-scarecrow-sustainable-advertising,Guardian Sustainable Business,2013-10-02,Is Chipotle's Scarecrow the future of sustainable advertising?,https://gu.com/p/3j893,,Is Chipotle's Scarecrow the future of sustainable advertising?,"Though it's had a mixed reception, Chipotle's advert does target our minds and encourage debate about processed food",887,"Chipotle, the Mexican grill fast food chain, recently launched an advertising campaign called The Scarecrow. It's an animated short film accompanied by a smartphone game and it's about the industrialised world of processed food. The advert has received a mixed reaction. Critics have been quick to accuse Chipotle of misleading consumers about how it goes about its business. The Atlantic's James Hamblin says the company is implying that it is not a fast-food chain. Others, such as David Sirota, in Salon, have taken issue with what they see as the advert endorsing a vegetarian diet, when the company has no plans to reduce meat on the menu. But Chipotle's film has also attracted gushing praise from Gawker and the New York Times. Regardless of the advert's critical reception, and how much we can read between the lines of what it is and what it isn't saying, it does seem to be doing a good job highlighting some of the fast food industry's most pressing issues: the overuse of antibiotics and cruel animal husbandry. In a behind-the-scenes video, Chipotle's chief marketing officer, Mark Crumpacker, said that ""…as we produce food on very, very large scales on industrial farms and through heavily processed means, there's a lot of negative consequences to that. Negative consequences to the animals, the environment, the farmers, and to public health."" The advert seems to want to inform consumers about how other fast food chains are operating, while at the same time subtly hinting that Chipotle's processes are more sustainable. It's saying: this is how other restaurants should be doing it. Sustainability as a USP would be useless if a brand couldn't back it up, but Chipotle can and the advert hopes to build on the reputation that it's built up over the past few years. In July, the chain became the first American restaurant committed to stripping its menu of all genetically modified food. It also has a longstanding commitment to what it calls Food with Integrity. At the same time, it understands that there are supply chain issues. For example, it can't guarantee that all its meat will be GMO-free because of supply shortages. So, just as it appears to be one of the more transparent fast food chains, could Chipotle's Scarecrow campaign be a cornerstone for the future of sustainable advertising? Its success depends very much on consumers not just understanding the message behind the campaign but participating in a debate on the issue of how their food is processed. Crumpacker told USA Today that the company was using the advert to target the so-called millenials (young people) as they tend to be more ""sceptical of brands that perpetuate themselves"". The hope is to ""educate people about where there food comes from"" and get them on their side. ""Consumers are simply used to adverts that indulge their senses and make them happy,"" an associate creative director of an advertising agency, who preferred to remain anonymous, told me. ""Chipotle has shaken the whole thing up and turned it on its head. They're marketing this at people's fears and lack of knowledge about how and where their food is sourced. They are trying to kickstart a debate and they want the consumers to be part of it."" Although initial online reaction has been mixed, it seems Chipotle might have a winning formula. In 2011, it launched its first sustainable farming campaign, Back to the Start, which, according to Technomic, had a big influence on the 23.4% increase in system-wide sales to $2.26bn. It was released online, in cinemas, and due to popular demand had a TV spot during an ad break in the 2012 Super Bowl; proving that Chipotle is no stranger to blurring the boundaries of traditional marketing and trying to get the public talking. To date, The Scarecrow advert, which is only available on YouTube, has been viewed 6.6m times – and the smartphone game downloaded more than 300,000 times – and has been the subject of thousands more tweets, comments and blogposts. Whether they be positive or negative, the majority are discussing Chipotle's sustainable food reputation. The hope is that this translates into sales, as it did with the company's previous campaign. The legacy and impact of the advert, beyond online reaction and articles like this, depends on Chipotle being able to back up its message and drive home its commitment to sustainability. For instance, the chain could consider labelling the food it serves with stickers on packaging that reassure consumers that the animals used haven't been factory farmed and are free of antibiotics. Or it could use its social media presence to make mistrustful consumers more aware of their commitment to GMO-free food and practices that are sustainable and ethical. From a marketing point of view, the advert contains no buzzwords, no grandiose claims and no anodyne statements. Surely that's to be commended? Even if Chipotle's advert has received some degree of criticism, then at least it has achieved its purpose of initiating a conversation on the messages of sustainability that lie behind it. It's nice to see an advert targeting our minds rather than our stomachs for once, and to see a fast food chain that has a brain. This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

139,article,sustainable-business/blog/rational-debate-gm-food-controversial,Guardian Sustainable Business,2013-09-26,Are we able to have a rational debate about GM?,https://gu.com/p/3jv7f,,Are we able to have a rational debate about GM?,"GM food is incredibly controversial but to decide whether or not it has a place in sustainable agriculture, is a dose of perspective needed?",1059,"If the biotech industry is to be believed, much of the world is in danger of missing a once-in-a generation chance to securely feed their future populations. Why? Because they won't tolerate farmers planting genetically modified (GM) crops. So should we believe them? Many don't. Some do. In countries such as US, Brazil, Canada, Argentina and Australia – all of them huge agricultural producers – regulators and farmers are generally gung-ho about GM. They boast of greater productivity, without compromising natural habitats (the percentage of total land used for agricultural has remained constant at 45% since 2000 in the US, according to the World Bank) or endangering public health. In Europe, the picture is very different. Policy makers and their publics are cautious at best. Opinion in much of Africa and Asia appears to be heading in the same direction. A few years ago, India pulled the plug on GM aubergines, for example. The exception is China, which is throwing public money at GM research with gusto. Let's say, for sake of argument, you sit on the fence. You're conscious that the world population is set to be around nine billion come 2050. That means more mouths to feed. You're aware that climate change could very possibly make farming difficult in crop-growing areas of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa. That further complicates the future picture for food security. Something clearly needs to be done. But does that something equal GM, with all its promises of pest-free and climate-resilient crops? Searching the science To answer that question, we need to know and trust the science. There's certainly no lack of it. The seed companies themselves publish – in part, at least – the research dossiers required by regulators as part of the approval process. The academic journals are brimming with it to. A search under ""GMO"" in the academic database ScienceDirect reveals 33 peer-reviewed articles in September alone. According to the industry, we can trust the scientists to get it right. ""There is very little controversy in the scientific community about the ability of scientists to make reliable assessment of these [GM] products"", said Mark Buckingham, UK spokesman for seed giant Monsanto. Moreover, the bulk of opinion in the world's laboratories is positive, he maintains. He points to a catalogue of peer-reviewed studies, including a recent paper in Ecological Economics about a reduction in pesticide poisoning in India since the introduction of GM cotton. For extra measure, he cited the rigorous health checks demanded by the likes of the European Food Safety Authority and the USA Food and Drug Administration. But then, as spokesperson for one of the world's largest biotech firms, he would say the science was on his side. Less easy to dismiss are those with no apparent commercial interest. David Cleary, director of agriculture at conservation group The Nature Conservancy said his organisation ""doesn't have any issues with the technology per se"". Biotech offers, in his view, just a ""faster route to what you would be doing through conventional crop breeding"". He too holds that there's an emerging consensus among the science community, at least on the vital issue of GM's impact on human health. It sounds convincing, but sceptics will note that The Nature Conservancy has a tie-in with Monsanto. Ask an activist, then. Until five years ago, environmentalist Mark Lynas was an out-an-out opponent of GM, going as far as to vandalise GM field experiments. He's now jumped ship. Why? Because (a) he read the peer-reviewed science, and (b) he found it sound. Moreover, he came to believe his willingness to take the scientists at their word on climate change but reject their conclusions on biotech was ""inconsistent"", especially as ""the major scientific institutions had made the same kind of statement on both issues"". Sell-out or seer? Plea for perspective If you were on the fence at the start of this article, you're probably still there. Clearly, there's a critical need for a rational, science-based debate about GM. That won't be easy. Two decades of fierce argument has indelibly marked a good deal of the research. Biotech politics have even crept into the supposedly science-based EU regulatory process, if recent papers by the UK's independent science advisory group ACRE are to be believed. One way to de-politicise the science is to boost public funding. Obviously, there's no such thing as 100% independent research: someone, somewhere has to fund it. Better that it's governments at arms length, than corporations up close. The United Nations-backed Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, which runs 15 research centres around the world and employees 10,000 scientists and technicians, shows that such an approach is possible. Greater public sector funding would also re-orientate the nature of biotech science, from one that's bound up ultimately by commercial obligations and constraints to one more centred on food security. At present, the business model of biotech firms means that they focus on ""first-world, technologically-sophisticated, fairly well capitalised farmers"", said Cleary at The Nature Conservancy. That's understandably so. But what of the farmers who need varieties of drought-resistant cassava or pest-free sorghum in East Africa? ""We don't see the benefits of biotechnology being directed to those farmers and that's a big issue"", argued Cleary. More than anything, what the GM debate needs is a good dose of perspective. Even it were the safest technology on earth, agricultural biotech offers no panacea when it comes to feeding our future generations. At present, the percentage of arable land devoted to GM remains in single figures. Far wiser that we concentrate on improving the other 90% plus. Margaret Zeigler, executive director at the business-led Global Harvest Initiative said: ""Farmers need a full suite of support … not just focusing on the seed alone."" She cited crop insurance, better extension services and modern irrigation technology by way of example. A science-based debate will hopefully shed light on whether GM crops should be included in such a ""suite"" of measures. It is a vitally important question, for sure. But no more so than deciding all the other steps that we can take right now to make world farming more productive and sustainable. • This article was amended in 26 September to change the population estimate from ""nine million"" to ""nine billion"".

140,article,sustainable-business/business-confront-cultural-social-moral-issues,Guardian Sustainable Business,2013-09-24,"Businesses cannot avoid involvement in cultural, social and moral issues",https://gu.com/p/3j227,,"Businesses cannot avoid involvement in cultural, social and moral issues",It's not enough just to abide by the rules - companies are embedded in society and cannot ignore the moral dimension,1098,"Business would like nothing better than to be acultural, asocial and amoral. The problem is that today this is simply not possible – a situation that makes many business leaders uncomfortable. Recently reading Simon Zadek's book The Civil Corporation, I came across a story about a utility company that was approached by an activist group and asked to stop issuing hunting licences on land that it owned. The response from the company was: ""To be honest, we don't have a view on hunting, and we do not particularly want to have one. Where does it all end? If there is a church but no mosque on our land, will we eventually have to have a view on God?"" This response betrays a frame of mind that is no longer viable in today's world. In this example it is impossible for the company concerned not to have a view on hunting. Whether it continues to issue hunting licenses or stops issuing them, it is taking a view, either in support of or against hunting. The trouble is that most corporations are ill-equipped to deal with such messy dilemmas – debates that are fundamentally cultural, social and moral not technical or operational. Playing by the rules Businesses would rather live in a world of clear and consistent rules, hire expensive advisers to make sure that, while exploiting all available loopholes, they stay within those rules. This avoids the need to become embroiled in the much messier questions of morals and cultural values – something they don't spend much time teaching in business school and which many businesses would like to believe is not their domain. In the current debate about tax avoidance by multinationals, Sir Roger Carr, president of CBI has said it ""cannot be about morality… it's all about the rules."" He is wrong. It is about both. The expectation that business can just follow the rules and ignore the broader moral dimensions of their actions is out-dated. Societies' expectations have changed. Activist groups and, increasingly, governments and other institutions, will call out corporations that are perceived to be behaving unethically, even if such behaviour is technically within the rules. Rules and legislation take time to compile and implement. By the time they are complete, they are largely obsolete and the world will have moved on. Rules are also, by their nature, limited in their scope. They can never cover every nook and cranny of evolving social expectations. The consequences of behaving in an acultural way can be immense. Businesses can spend years and endless resources trying to be successful only to see it all come crashing down. Be it in the realm of animal experimentation, genetically modified foods, environmental degradation, human rights, taxation, resource extraction, investment strategy, online privacy, zero hours contracts, or the many other areas of cultural and moral complexity, businesses have wasted resources and faced failure because they either dismissed or failed to foresee the broader socio-cultural implications. Social responsibility Business is embedded in society. It is not separate from broad, messy and chaotic social behaviours. Sustainable businesses, therefore, need to develop clear views on all the socio-cultural aspects with which their business interacts. It is simply not viable to set limits of involvement or to persist in the view that the role of business is to generate wealth and shareholder value rather than to play a full and active role in building societies – including getting directly involved in the complex moral issues that affect us all. Business leaders are often led further astray by professional technocrats – be they scientists, economists or other professional advisers. These advisers see themselves as rational, objective, knowledgeable and all the other adjectives that are used to justify being acultural and, supposedly, unemotional. For instance, supported by scientists and other technocrats, many corporations easily fall into the trap of reaching the conclusion that the facts and science are on their side. The solution is seen as spending millions on advertising, PR and lobbying to ""educate"" the decision-makers and a public that is perceived as ignorant, uninformed or irrational. This epitomises the acultural, technocratic approach to business and society. Sometimes it works. Increasingly it is blowing up in management's face. In the field of genetically modified crops for example, Sir Paul Nurse, president of the Royal Society, put it like this: ""the consensus view of the majority of expert scientists is that in principle this is a safe approach and can lead to benefits, but not only commercial ones but also may allow us to tackle global problems such as sustainability and food production, crop yields, marginal habitats for crop growing, for example"". Decades and hundreds of millions have been spent trying to educate the European public in this ""scientific truth"" - which fails to address the many and complex issues in the GMO debate. It has all come to nothing. Monsanto recently threw in the towel and announced that it would stop trying to introduce GMOs in Europe. The more the ""rational"" message was pushed, the greater the resistance and the less it was believed – not least because it was self-interested corporations that were doing the talking. Abandon delusions Business leaders have very little option but to build the capabilities necessary to become embroiled in the muddy waters of moral, cultural and social debate. They need to abandon the delusion of being able to continue to operate in an aseptic environment bounded by a set of clear and supposedly rational rules. Building such capabilities will not be straightforward. I have not yet seen cultural studies or the building of ethnographic skills on any business school curricula. Nevertheless, these capabilities can be built – if slowly and painstakingly. Already today we see some corporations better equipped than others at understanding and operating within cultural frames. Usually they are the ones who have learned through painful – and expensive – experience. The first step is to recognise the need and to start the conversation. The second is to make social, cultural and moral discussion the subject of every project or investment proposal. Training and development programmes can help provide the skills necessary. Over time corporations need to grow acute and sensitive cultural antennae to supplement the good understanding of markets, customers, ROI, and all the other traditional business skills that they already possess. Those with the most sensitive antennae will likely outpace competition by a wide margin. Joe Zammit-Lucia is an author, commentator and leadership adviser.

In a series of parliamentary and public meetings held this week in London, Edinburgh and Cardiff, Prof Gilles-Eric Séralini has challenged UK politicians and safety authorities to review the way safety is assessed. Séralini, a molecular biologist at Caen University, said: ""Our research found severe toxicity from GM maize and [Monsanto pesticide] Roundup. The British Food Standards Agency has uncritically accepted the European Food Safety Authority's dismissal of the study, even though many of EFSA's experts have been exposed as having conflicts of interest with the GM industry. At the very least, the British government should demand long-term mandatory safety testing on all GM foods before they are released onto the market,"" he said. ""The British scientific authorities are deliberately misleading their government and are recklessly endangering public health in ignoring the findings of our research."" Séralini's study found that rats developed much higher levels of cancers and died earlier than controls when fed a diet of Monsanto's Roundup-tolerant GM maize NK603 for two years, or were exposed to Roundup over the same period. The usual industry tests last for 90 days. The former member of two French government committees assessing the safety of GM foods suggested that the results could be explained by the endocrine-disrupting effects of the pesticide Roundup, and over-expression of the transgene in the genetically modified organism (GMO). But although the €3.2m study was published in a peer-reviewed journal and claimed to be the most thorough long-term testing of GM food ever done, it attracted a torrent of criticism from the industry and some academics. It was refuted by several food standards agencies, including the UK's FSA as ""biased, poorly performed, bogus, and substandard."" Monsanto, whose pesticide Roundup is engineered to be in most of the world's GM food crops, said it ""did not meet minimum acceptable standards for this type of scientific research."" Séralini, in Britain for the first time since the paper was published, said he had been shocked by the ""dishonesty"" of many of his critics. ""They reacted without checking anything. Mostly their quotes were stupid like 'GM has been used for years so it must be OK'. The fact that they were so violent suggested they had something to hide. ""I have been shocked at the conflicts of interests of so many scientists. There's much more than I thought. The problem is that there is a small group of scientists who attack you without checking the data for themselves. They do not demand the data from Monsanto."" But he said one year on his heavily criticised methodology is now being vindicated. A French government agency has called for tenders to repeat the experiment, and the EFSA has issued new guidelines to assess the risk of long-term toxicity from GM foods, which he said largely validate the way he conducted his experiments. EFSA has also accepted that no standardised protocol or guidelines exist. However a spokesman for EFSA said: ""EFSA's recent report has no implications on the authority's previous opinions related to the Séralini study and it should not seen as a validation of this study."" Séralini said: ""I am not upset with GM, only the way it is controlled and assessed. It is bad for food. We are using the technology to make 'pesticide plants'. The way the technology is used is not neutral. I was in favour of GM. I am a molecular biologist. I believed it would reduce pesticides but I saw it did the opposite."" The problem, he said, was not just the pesticide, in this case Roundup, which is widely known to be highly toxic, but the GM process itself. ""This was a landmark finding, to show that the GM 'event' itself is a problem. The GM is designed to produce enzymes which indirectly destroy the protective compounds in the plant. ""I am sorry that the link between GM and pesticides is not made. The GM allows more pesticide to be contained in the plant. Nearly 80% of GMOs are designed to absorb Roundup. The other 20% are designed to produce their own pesticide. We found that pesticides are not really tested."" The issue may not be resolved until both Monsanto and Séralini publish the raw data from their studies. ""We have put our data in the hands of a notary and will release it as soon as they release theirs. Monsanto wants to know what data we have. They do not want a comparisonof my data to theirs. They want to hide their data. ""I discovered that their [Monsanto] historical data is wrong. They say to me 'you haven't looked at the historical data.' But I believe their historical data is contaminated. I believe Monsanto and the regulatory authorities have systematically underestimated the side-effects [of GM food]. All the regulatory tests are falsified by contamination of the data."" He said he wants his data to be compared. ""That is the only way to show what I have done is 10 times better than they have. My data is just raw data. Theirs is important for the release and consumption of [commercial] food."" An FSA spokeswoman said: ""This paper was reviewed by EFSA – and by a number of other regulatory bodies around the world – all of whom agreed that the results did not support these conclusions. EFSA's assessment has been backed by many other bodies who have carried out detailed reviews of the study and of the significance of the results. This includes the national food safety authorities in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark. Our own scientists at the FSA agree with the points raised in these reviews. ""In relation to the claimed link between GM maize and cancer, the study used a strain of rats that is particularly prone to tumours. It is therefore not surprising that tumours were seen both in the GM-fed animals and in the non-GM fed controls. However, the number of animals used in the study was too small to determine whether there were significant differences between the two groups.""",,0.01971771471771472
142,article,sustainable-business/seed-freedom-hunger-malnutrition-biodiversity,Guardian Sustainable Business,2013-08-28,'Seed freedom is the answer to hunger and malnutrition',https://gu.com/p/3t3gd,,'Seed freedom is the answer to hunger and malnutrition',"We must resist seed monopolies of corporates, they harm us all, writes biodiversity campaigner <strong>Vandana Shiva </strong><br /><br />• Vandana Shiva will be speaking at the <a href=""http://www.resurgence.org/take-part/resurgence-events/wellbeing-festival-2013.html"" title="""">Resurgence &amp; Ecologist Festival of Wellbeing on 12 October 2013</a>",1085,"What happens to the seed affects the web of life. When seed is living, regenerative and diverse, it feeds pollinators, soil organisms and animals - including humans. When seed is non-renewable, bred for chemicals, or genetically engineered with toxic Bt or Roundup Ready genes, diversity disappears. In recent years, beekeepers have been losing 25% of their hives each winter. According to a scientific study in 2008, bees and pollinators contribute more than €153bn annually to agriculture. Chemically-farmed soils, sprayed with herbicides and pesticides kill the beneficial organisms that create soil fertility and protect plants. Organic seeds and organic farming do not just protect human health; they protect the health and wellbeing of all. The rise of monocultures With industrial seeds and industrial agriculture, the diversity of plants and crops disappears. India had 200,000 rice varieties before the ""green revolution"" in the 1970s, which relied on pesticides and fertilisers to avert famine in India. This diversity was replaced by monocultures. Today the fastest expanse in acreage is of genetically engineered corn and soya, because they are patented and corporations can collect royalties from farmers. When seed freedom disappears and farmers become dependent on GMO seeds, they in effect become seed slaves. According to the National Bureau of Crime Records, more than 284,000 Indian farmers have committed suicide since seed monopolies were established in India. Gandhi spun cotton for our freedom. Today GMO Bt cotton has enslaved our farmers in debt, and pushed them to suicide. And 95% cotton seed is controlled by one company: Monsanto. When culture is eroded, biodiversity is eroded. And when control over seeds becomes big business, diversity disappears faster. Diversity is a product of care, connection and cultural pride. Greed versus care The tribals and peasants who gave us rice diversity wanted to evolve a rice for lactating mothers, a rice for babies, a rice for old people. They wanted to have rices that would survive droughts and floods and cyclones, so they evolved climate-resilient rices. In the Himalaya, different rices are needed for different altitudes and different slopes. The intimacy and care that go with belonging to a place and a community allows diversity to flourish. Greed promotes carelessness and drives control, and control is facilitated by uniformity and monocultures. You cannot control diversity, you can only co-evolve and co-create with it. A will to control becomes a will to destroy diversity, through what I have called the monoculture of the mind. And the expansion of corporate control over seed and plants is the main reason for the disappearance of diversity in our fields and in our food. Undermining health and nutrition Corporations first controlled agriculture through the chemical inputs for the green revolution. External chemical inputs demand uniformity and monocultures. In an ecological system, wheat and mustard and chana grow in a mixture, as an internal input self-organising system is based on diversity and co-operation. When ecological inputs are replaced with external inputs, diversity becomes a problem, and monocultures become an imperative. Chemically-fertilised crops start competing with one another and different external inputs have to be applied to different crops. This is how the green revolution destroyed our rich diversity of rice and wheat. Millets, which we at Navdanya call forgotten foods, were driven out of our farms and from our plates on totally unscientific criteria of being called inferior grains, even though in health and nutrition terms they are superior to green revolution and hybrid rice and wheat. Indigenous rice and wheat varieties are superior in nutrition to the new varieties. Native rices have a low glycaemic index, while industrial rice has a high glycaemic index. When all that the poor get is industrial rice, they also get diabetes. India is now the capital of diabetes, which is intimately linked to the disappearance of diversity. Not only does living, organic seed have more quality, nutrition and taste; farming systems that are based on biodiversity produce more nutrition and ""health per acre"", as the Navdanya study has shown. Seed freedom is the answer to hunger and malnutrition. One billion people today are hungry and two billion are obese because agriculture is out of balance with nature. Half of humanity is denied wellbeing through food. Globalisation and the disappearance of diversity Globalisation means an expanded and aggressive assault on the diversity of our crops and foods is taking place. There are three forces driving the disappearance of diversity, and all are connected to corporate control over seed and food. The first is the entry of big business in the seed market, with uniform commercial, industrial hybrids and GMOs, and the consequent displacement of local diverse varieties evolved by farmers. Local farmers grew different water melon varieties, and water melons were seasonal fruits. Today you get only one oblong variety everywhere, all year round, because watermelon seeds are now commercial hybrids sold by corporations, which can only breed and sell uniformity. The second factor in the disappearance of diversity is long-distance trade. Diversity goes hand in hand with local, decentralised food systems. Long-distance trade replaces freshness and softness with hardness, so fruits can travel. You may have noticed how soft jacket oranges have disappeared and been replaced with varieties that cannot be peeled. Corporations are advising the Indian government that bananas and mangoes need a makeover to travel longer, and stay longer on shelves. The third factor is industrial processing. When McDonald's wants potatoes for French fries, only Russell Burbank will grow. Pepsi's Lay's chips cannot use indigenous potato diversity – such as the tomri that we grow in the mountains. Ketchup requires tomatoes with pulp, not juice. So the juicy, tasty tomatoes disappear, and hard and tasteless tomatoes replace them. The Italians have continued to grow good, diverse tomatoes since and have managed to get the Mediterranean diet on the Unesco heritage list. Every cuisine in every part of India deserves to be recognised as a cultural heritage. Navdanya has been making its contributions to protecting biodiversity and food heritage,. But the issue is too important not to be taken up by every citizen in their daily lives. We are what we eat. When we are careless with food we are careless with ourselves. Will we only wake up when the last peasant and the last seed disappears?

143,article,environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/jul/08/climate-change-superfreakonomics-superfreakingwrong,Environment,2013-07-08,Global warming and economists - SuperFreakonomics is SuperFreakingWrong | John Abraham,https://gu.com/p/3h5hn,News,Global warming and economists - SuperFreakonomics is SuperFreakingWrong,Those who purchased the book SuperFreakonomics are paying to be misled about climate change,1146,"Perhaps I have been naïve, but for many years I have held the view that economists were good decision makers and that part of being a good decision maker was to seek out good information. Well-informed decisions, I thought, allowed people to earn better returns, to be better prepared for future events. How wrong I was … about certain economists. After watching how some of my economist colleagues have communicated their opinions on future economic threats and opportunities resulting from climate change, I have finally realized that many are doing a great disservice to those who rely on their knowledge and expertise. That's right – economic ""experts"" who opine on climate change are costing their audiences and clients real money. These are often business professionals who pay for information and rightfully expect not to be misled. People who need good information for decision making are being shortchanged. It is easy to find examples of poor information being purveyed by media outlets such as Fox News (where top management issued a policy mandating that concerns about climate change should be minimized), the Wall Street Journal (which never met a climate skeptic it didn't like), or Forbes magazine (which promotes the views of radical groups like the Heartland Institute as it lurches from scandal to scandal) that oversells its views and under-delivers on reliable information. We have come to expect biased information from these media outlets. But what about groups and individuals who have been regarded as reliable sources of information? For instance, a recent report on financial news source CNBC found that they significantly over-report the doubts about climate change. Furthermore, they routinely invite business persons to speak about climate change but rarely do they invite an actual climate scientist. As a result, their audience is being misled. They are being denied important information that can be used to protect and grow their assets. That's right. A network media outlet whose job it is to inform their audience is doing the exact opposite. But let me use a case study to show how bad this type of misinformation can be – and this one comes from a surprising source, Steven Levitt, who is a business professor at the University of Chicago. You may not know him by name, but he has co-authored some very popular books (Freakonomics and SuperFreakonomics). While famous among the general public, Dr. Levitt is infamous among real scientists who found errors in his books so elementary that even first-year college students would not have made them. Let's just look at a few examples. Perhaps most embarrassing is that of his description of Dr. Ken Caldeira's research – Caldeira is one of the world's leading atmospheric scientists. Levitt claimed that Dr. Caldeira's research ""tells him that carbon dioxide is not the right villain"". Really? Dr. Caldeira must not have been happy with this claim because on his faculty website he states that carbon dioxide is, in fact, ""the right villain"". That's right, just click on the link and look at the text right below Dr. Caldeira's photograph. Dr. Levitt also writes of methane that it is ""about 25 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide,"" but he did not bother to inform readers that methane is measured in parts per billion in the atmosphere - thus far much rarer than carbon dioxide, which is measured in parts per million. Dr. Levitt writes that ""agnostics grumble that human activity accounts for just 2% of the global carbon dioxide emissions"" but never tells the reader that these are gross emissions, not net emissions. In fact, humans are responsible for the entire net increase in carbon dioxide – 40% of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at this time has come from human-caused emissions. How could a professor of business not understand the difference between net and gross emissions? A significant part of his chapter on global warming involves a description of the entrepreneurs attempting to find a geo-engineering solution to the problem of global warming. While discussing these techniques, Dr. Levitt writes that carbon dioxide is not poisonous – in fact, acceptable levels of carbon dioxide in modern buildings can be notably higher than the level in the atmosphere yet still be safe for humans to breathe. While this is true, Dr. Levitt fails to recognize that concerns about CO2 levels in the atmosphere have nothing at all to do with breathing CO2 but rather with the fact that it causes the atmosphere to warm. Dr. Levitt then states ""carbon dioxide doesn't necessarily warm the earth"". This is complete fantasy. What about his amazing claim that solar PV systems can actually warm the planet? More baloney. I could go on, but you get the point. Why am I debunking this book now? It was released in 2009, and since that time others have posted excellent takedowns, some even written by his own university colleagues, among others. Instead of another debunking, I want to focus on two important points. The first is that in SuperFreakonomics, the authors propose that instead of reducing our emissions of heat-trapping gases, we should trust our fate to unproven and dangerous technologies for geo-engineering the planet. One prominent geo-engineering concept is the spraying of particles into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight back out to space. Yep, you read that right. We should pollute the atmosphere in order to counter our pollution of the atmosphere. But even if it did work, the problem of carbon dioxide being absorbed by the oceans (ocean acidification) will not have been solved. If the authors of this book cannot tell the difference between gross and net emissions, if they can't bother to ask a climate scientist whether solar cells would warm the planet, if they could mistakenly state Dr. Caldeira's position, how can they be expected to be correct on something as complicated as geo-engineering? My second point is that Dr. Levitt is a university professor who has a duty to society to get things right. We do, and should, hold university faculty to a higher standard than Fox, CNBC, the Wall Street Journal and the Heartland Institute. Are there business or economics experts who actually get the science right? The answer is yes, there are. Some of the groups with the most skin in the game actually understand what is going on. One excellent example is the reinsurance company Munich Re which made a splash with its climate cost declarations. Another great recent example is the article Race of our Lives by Jeremy Grantham of GMO, a large global investment management firm. So we can see that while groups pushing an ideology, or professors pushing books, have trouble with even basic climate science, those investing real money often have a better track record of understanding the risks we face as we continue to warm the globe. Let's hope that we listen soon enough to do something about it.",,0.21948948948948954
144,article,sustainable-business/sustainable-business-important-corporate-america,Guardian Sustainable Business,2013-06-13,Sustainable business has never been more important for corporate America,https://gu.com/p/3ghv8,,Sustainable business has never been more important for corporate America,"As <strong>Marc Gunther </strong>joins Guardian Sustainable Business US as editor-at-large, he calls on companies to wake up to the challenges of the sustainable business agenda",1297,"400. 1,127. 354. Those three numbers made news this spring. They point to the frustrations – and failures – of those of us inside and outside of corporate America who would like business to become more sustainable. 400: Atmospheric concentrations of CO2 passed the symbolic threshold of 400 parts per million. Big companies talk a good game on climate change, but global emissions keep rising. Climate remains the defining issue of our time; if business can't find a way to bring down its emissions, and ours, we're all in trouble. 1,127: The death toll in the collapse of the garment factory outside Dhaka, Bangladesh, making it the deadliest disaster in the industry's history. Years of extensive and expensive supply-chain monitoring by the biggest US clothing brands, including Nike, Gap and Walmart, however well-intentioned, have brought only modest improvements to labour standards in the world's poorest countries. 354: Last year, chief executives of the companies that make up the S&amp;P500 Index received, on average $12.3m in total compensation, according to the AFL-CIO. By contrast, rank-and-file workers averaged $34,645. That means CEOs made 354 times more than their employees. This exacerbates inequality, undermines trust in business, and leads ordinary people across the political spectrum to believe that the system is tilted in favour of the rich and powerful, and against them. You know what? They're right. And yet. The sustainable business agenda has never been more relevant. And the opportunities for companies that take an expansive view of their role in the world have never been greater. Smart companies recognise that these big issues – climate change, global poverty and income inequality in the US – cannot be left to governments or NGOs to solve. The US government is not merely grid-locked; it has shown itself to be incapable of effectively tackling tough, long-term problems. That needs to change, and soon. By themselves, NGOs don't have the power or the resources to drive systemic change. Consumers are, alas, mostly indifferent. Only business has the creativity, the power and the scale to make really big things happen. It also has the incentive: climate change, global poverty and income inequality are business problems as well as social problems. They create risks that threaten the stability that capitalism needs to thrive. More important, they present enormous opportunities to those businesses that find ways to help solve them. As a journalist, author, speaker and blogger, I've participated in the conversation about the social and environmental impact of business for more than a decade. I'm excited now to bring my work to Guardian Sustainable Business US as editor-at-large. Guardian Sustainable Business and I share a common agenda: to cheer the leading businesses, to jeer at laggards, to tell compelling stories (because there's nothing quite so interesting as the challenges facing business to day), to deliver insight and, ultimately, to challenge corporate America to profitably address issues ranging from climate change and resource scarcity to poverty and biodiversity loss. There's good reason to believe that progress can be made. Much already has. Thanks largely to globalisation, more people have emerged from poverty in the last two decades than during any comparable period in human history. (In Bangladesh, where the garment industry generates $18bn in annual exports, life expectancy has grown from 56 to 69 during the last 20 years.) Some of the biggest and most influential US companies – GE, IBM, Walmart and Google, among others – have embraced the rhetoric of sustainability and made more-or-less serious commitments to drive change. Consumers are beginning to align their purchases with their values. NGOs collaborate with big companies when their interests coincide. Perhaps most importantly, more and more workers, especially young people, demand meaning as well as money from their jobs; they want to work for companies that are part of the solution, not part of the problem. Those companies that attract and engage them will rise to the top. Put simply, the sustainable business movement has accomplished a great deal but not nearly enough. As Aron Cramer, the chief executive of Business for Social Responsibility, put it when reviewing the two decades since the Rio summit and the founding of BSR: ""It seems that everything has changed… and nothing has changed."" So what's ahead? Here are some of the stories, broadly defined, that we hope to cover at Guardian Sustainable Business US: Getting beyond incrementalism Making office buildings, factories and supply chains more efficient is necessary, but not sufficient. Energy efficiency is also kind of boring, truth be told; not many people want to read about HVAC. What's interesting and important are bold new ideas, the most innovative ""green"" products and sustainability breakthroughs. Some small-scale examples: the solar lanterns for the poor made by d.light, the packaging from ocean waste made by Method and Coca-Cola's ekocycle work. None are big enough to matter, yet, but they point us in the direction we need to go. Seeking systemic change Last month at Fortune magazine's Brainstorm Green conference on business and the environment, NRG Energy CEO David Crane joined leaders from the solar power industry and investors to talk about how to get solar panels on to half the rooftops in America. That's systemic change, not only because it would move the country from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy, but because it decentralises power, literally and metaphorically. By contrast, let's not pretend that a company that puts panels on the roof of a warehouse or two is having a meaningful impact. Similarly, only industry-wide initiatives will be able to tackle persistent violations of workers' rights in factories and on farms in the global south. As BSR's Cramer has said: ""The era of the hermetically sealed, vertically integrated company is long gone. Every business, in every part of the world, operates within a web of systems: economic, cultural, political, and natural... So the solutions we need to achieve our goals must also be systemic."" Metrics matter Plastic or paper? Local or global? Organic or conventional? GMO or not? Farmed fish or wild? Until the full social and environmental costs of production are priced into every product, those questions will be impossible to answer. Fortunately, big companies, NGOs and scientists are working hard to rank and rate a vast array of products and companies. Whether it's The Sustainability Consortium, or the Higg index being developed by the apparel industry, or Walmart's work with suppliers, or Good Guide and Climate Counts, better sustainability measurement will gradually drive change. The policy imperative How companies behave matters. How they behave in Washington and in state capitals can matter just as much, or more. Too often, companies focus on their narrow, short-term self-interest; the result is that political battles over the environment, taxation and financial regulation are dominated by the regulated industries, while the business community as a whole is absent. Particularly when it comes to carbon regulation, progressive companies need to stand up and be heard. Investors of the world, unite! Corporate-governance reformers and sustainability advocates have mostly operated on parallel tracks. (CERES, the investor-environmental coalition, is an exception.) The institutional owners of big public companies – pension funds, mutual funds, universities and foundations – have an enormous, untapped opportunity to promote long-term thinking and value creation. They can remind management that investors care about more than the performance of their portfolios; they want the companies they own to help create a more just and sustainable world. We'll explore these stories, and many more, together here at Guardian Sustainable Business US. Please let us know if you come across ideas or companies or people that merit our attention.

145,article,sustainable-business/blog/failure-gm-sustainable-fish-farming,Guardian Sustainable Business,2013-06-07,Will a failure to consider GM hold back sustainable fish farming?,https://gu.com/p/3gdxh,,Will a failure to consider GM hold back sustainable fish farming?,"A food retailer's refusal to stock salmon fed with GM yeast may hold up technology that delivers environmental benefits, writes <strong>Marc Gunther</strong>",939,"When the agribusiness and chemical giant Dupont decided to get into aquaculture, Scott Nichols, the executive in charge, went to see experts at the World Wildlife Fund and the Environmental Defence Fund. He needed their advice and wanted their support. DuPont planned to feed genetically-engineered yeast to farmed salmon, instead of relying on oils from wild fish captured from the ocean. That would help preserve marine ecosystems, but Nichols was well aware that using genetically-engineered feed could become an issue. ""Sisyphus has a job,"" he told the experts. ""I don't want it."" Since then, DuPont has joined with AquaChile, one of the world's big aquaculture firms, to create Verlasso, a brand of salmon that is marketed as ""harmoniously farmed"" in the ""crystal-clear water of Patagonia"". DuPont grows the omega-3 rich yeast. AquaChile grows the fish. Environmentalists like WWF's Jason Clay praise this thoughtful approach to aquaculture, saying ""to take pressure away from taking fish out of the ocean is a good thing."". But there's a problem. Whole Foods Market – the US's most important retailer of organic, natural or sustainable foods – won't carry Verlasso salmon. Why not? Partly because Verlasso is raising Atlantic salmon in the Pacific Ocean, and Whole Foods prefers suppliers who farm species in their native waters, and partly because Verlasso occasionally uses antibiotics, which are prohibited by Whole Foods. In addition, Whole Foods is seeking to carry fewer foods using GMOs – even though, in this case, the GMO yeast is a substitute for fish oils. ""Our customers prefer non-GMO when possible, so when we can source something without GMOs, we will certainly do that,"" said Beth Krauss, a Whole Foods spokeswoman, after consulting seafood buyer David Pilat. ""If we can get farm-raised salmon without GMO feed being used, we will."" This matters, and not just to Verlasso. Whole Foods recently said that by 2018 it will require all products in its stores to be labelled if they contain GMOs, and will avoid foods with GMOs when possible. Labelling is part of the company's commitment to transparency, but labelling could also stigmatise GMOs, despite the broad scientific consensus in the US that the genetically-engineered crops currently on the market are safe to eat. More broadly, Whole Foods' aversion to GMOs could stifle efforts to use genetic engineering technology to produce crops that deliver benefits whether to the environment (crops that use less water, or require less land), health (foods with more nutrients), or the economy (higher-yielding crops that cost consumers less). About 17.3 million farmers, most of them in emerging markets of India and China (and most of whom growing cotton), chose to plant biotech crops in 2012, according to the ISAAA (International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications). While Whole Foods, with annual sales of $11.7bn (£7.5bn) in 2012, is far from the biggest US supermarket chain – Kroger, Safeway, Supervalu, Publix and, of course, Walmart, are all much bigger – the Austin-based retailer and its 350 outlets have an outsized influence, particularly over brands that market themselves as organic, natural or sustainable. Entrepreneurs Jeffrey Hollender of Seventh Generation, Myra and Drew Goodman of Earthbound Farms and Seth Goldman of Honest Tea have all told me that backing from Whole Foods has helped to drive their growth. Conversely, companies like Verlasso with a sustainability story to tell will have tougher time getting the word out, as well as getting their product out, if they can't get on shelves at Whole Foods. ""We'd love to be in their stores,"" said Scott Nichols, who is now the director of Verlasso. ""They are leaders."" The irony, of course, is Verlasso itself is out to become a sustainability leader. Substituting plant-based feed for fish oils reduces pressure on the oceans. About half of the world's fish oil production goes into farming salmon, according to a comprehensive 2008 FAO study. When compared with conventional fish farms, Verlasso says it gives its salmon more water in which to swim, uses fewer antibiotics and takes extra precautions to prevent fish escapes . ""We feel a tremendous urgency to get this right,"" says Nichols. Verlasso is seeking certification from the Aquaculture Stewardship Council, a new standard-setting group. While there are a host of problems with farmed Atlantic salmon — the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch ratings recommend that customers avoid them entirely — organisations such as WWF say that, when done responsibly, salmon aquaculture's impact on wild fish populations, marine habitats and water scarcity can be reduced. Whole Foods has developed its own rigorous standards for aquaculture. Greenpeace, which ranked the seafood policies of 20 big retailers, praises Whole Foods for having ""the most rigorous sustainable seafood policy in the industry"". Greenpeace opposes the spread of GMOs, citing potential dangers to the environment and human health. Whole Foods, notably, makes no such claims. Its communication around GMOs refers to customer preferences, which the company says come after customer surveys and dialogue. ""We are not making any claims with regard to good or bad,"" Whole Foods' Beth Krauss said. Purely as a business proposition, its stance towards GMOs will play well with its core audience, particularly parents who are concerned about what their children eat. Still, it's worth asking: instead of catering to anxieties about GMOs, why not educate people – as Whole Foods has done, effectively, around such issues as animal welfare? GMOs have benefits. They have risks, too – as do all technologies. The job of a responsible company is to weigh those trade-offs. Whole Foods' antipathy towards GMOs could have unfortunate and unintended consequences.

146,article,sustainable-business/blog/brainstorm-green-innovation-collaboration-sustainability,Guardian Sustainable Business,2013-05-01,Diary of Brainstorm Green: a call for innovation and collaboration,https://gu.com/p/3fgm7,,Diary of Brainstorm Green: a call for innovation and collaboration,"Engaging CFOs, begging forgiveness for past sustainability crimes and a slap on the wrist for non-collaborative environmentalists. <strong>Jo Confino </strong>has the highlights of day two",1412,"There is a noticeable change of mood among American sustainability practitioners with a belief they may have crossed an important threshold. Rather than the old paradigm, dominated by the need to develop the business case for change, much talk at this year's Brainstorm Green conference in California has been focused on the opportunities that can come from driving innovation. But while some of the more progressive participants recognise that progress is being made, they also criticise companies for being too self-congratulatory and for doing the equivalent of twiddling their thumbs while Rome burns. This is because the modest progress being achieved by the corporate sector is almost irrelevant, when set against the scale of the challenges and rapidly worsening environmental and social indicators. Advice on how to talk to your chief financial officer One of the big hurdles that still needs to be overcome is how to encourage chief financial officers (CFO) to take sustainability seriously, especially at a time of austerity. The scale of this problem was illustrated by the fact that the most popular break-out session at Brainstorm Green was focused on step one of the sustainability journey: 'selling sustainable investments to your CFO.' What is clear is sustainability executives are caught between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand everyone talks of the need to follow standard processes to get investments approved and not make sustainability a special case. But on the other hand, many CFOs still believe that sustainability is not core to their business so that those seeking change have to be either canny or seditious. So what is the best advice? Rick Needham, Google's director of energy and sustainability, clearly has an easier time than most because the CFO is a supporter, but he suggests incorporating employees from the finance team into projects from the beginning. He admits that a big help is the fact that Google's culture is based on being open to doing things differently. ""When we suggest new things, we do not ask why we want to do it, but we ask why not do it,"" he said. Len Sauers, head of global sustainability at Procter &amp; Gamble, says it is important to find metrics to show not just the quantative advantages but also the qualitative benefits, such as building brand equity or supporting a reduction in the use of fossil fuels. Microsoft's senior director for environmental sustainability, TJ DiCaprio said a fundamental breakthrough for the company was to develop an internal carbon price. ""By pricing carbon, we have dramatically influenced the long term planning,"" she says. ""This not only drives efficiency but changes the whole framing of the debate."" Mike Robinson, head of sustainability and regulatory affairs at General Motors, talked of the importance of finding allies both within the company and externally. Of particular importance is getting support from the chief risk officer, while the other ""Machiavellian"" approach is to leverage the influence of socially responsible investors ""who tell our people directly what is on their mind."" Forgiveness for past misdemeanors It's not often that you see a CEO of a global company do the equivalent of go down on his knees and ask for forgiveness for past misdemeanours. But this is what the boss of General Motors, Daniel Akerson, did when talking to the 300 senior business executives at Brainstorm Green. He admitted the company had been ""part of the problem, rather than the solution"" when it came to its previous attempts to block government plans for improving car mileage standards. Akerson was extremely critical of the previous management for ""delegating it too far down the organisation and for its institutional bias."" He also accepted the approach of senior executives had been too short-termist and said that sustainability was now woven into the company's global strategy. ""Every decision we make, I want to know what it will do in the decades ahead,"" he said. Another criticism of the previous approach had been a knee-jerk approach to denying climate change. He said: ""You cannot argue opinions without facts and it is pretty hard not to be convinced that something is happening in the world."" Akerson said the company was aggressively pursuing electric cars, biofuels, hydrogen fuel cells and natural gas. ""We have to have electrification here,"" he said. ""Lots of people do not want to face that fact."" While Akerson said that by 2017, he hoped to have sold 500,000 electric cars on the roads, he admitted the company is currently making a loss on each of the 26,500 Volt cars it has so far sold. To show he company's commitment, GM is to bring out a Cadillac electric vehicle and has improved the range of its next generation of cars. To take advantage of the vast quantities of shale gas, Akerson called on Capital Hill to develop an integrated energy policy. ""I think we have a moment in time to really change the calculus for this country in so many dimensions,"" he said. ""There has to be an integrated national policy with political leadership to bring energy and the manufacturing industry together."" Getting cars off our streets While GM's boss was talking about selling more cars, a debate on the future of cities concentrated much of its attention on how to get vehicles off the streets to ease congestion and pollution. There was much talk of introducing light railways into US cities and the re-introduction of trams. Jay Carson, CEO of the C40 cities climate leadership group, said some city politicians, such as the mayor of Rio de Janeiro, were not using the big stick of climate change to drive change but were selling the concept of making cities more pleasurable to live in. Expert Peter Calthorpe gave the example of Los Angeles that has lined up around $40bn of investment for public transport initiatives, with hardly any money for new roads. ""The age of the highway city is over,"" he said. ""It is not desirable."" Eric Spiegel, the CEO of Siemens, said that the damage Hurricane Sandy did to New York, showed the importance of having a radical rethink about combining resilience with sustainability. He said the huge power outages showed the need to create micro grids: ""Resilience is becoming a big issue. What is New York going to do differently and how much will it cost?"" Why environmentalists need to adapt Mark Tereck, the CEO of the Nature Conservancy does not mind ruffling a few feathers. The former managing director of Goldman Sachs is particularly critical of others in the environmental movement, for being overly judgmental and failing the see the benefits of collaborating with businesses. Here are a few of his choice comments on the matter: • ""Environmentalists often have theories but little evidence for what is effective."" • ""Environmentalists are not as popular as we want to be because sometimes we end up lecturing people, so we need to put ourselves in the shoes of other parts of society, roll up our sleeves and pay attention to economic considerations."" • ""We love our choir and criticising bad actors, but we have to build relationships."" • ""There has been a radical shift. The 20th century was about protecting nature from people and now it's about preserving nature for people."" • ""We environmentalists love nature and believe our children need a healthy ecosystem but the shortcoming is there are not enough people in the world who see it that way."" • ""On fracking, environmentalists suggest it's about good versus evil and it is not that simple. It has enormous environmental challenges, but in my view it is likely they can be addressed. Environmentalists have to see that a lot of people can benefit from gas, it's silly to pretend otherwise, and it can be irresponsible to be on the sidelines, so just saying no is not a good position. We need to look at how can you have fracking while protecting ecosystems. We are stuck and hope the natural capital dialogue will offer a way to be less divisive, less vilifying and more collaborative about how to build momentum to address climate change."" • ""GMO companies have not won our complete support as they are not in the business of creating drought resistance crops to support poor people, but it is totally irrational to use criticisms of Monsanto's behaviour to attacked GMO.""

147,article,environment/blog/2013/apr/19/gm-food-labelling-consumers,Environment,2013-04-19,Consumers should have the right to know if they are eating GM food,https://gu.com/p/3f988,News,Consumers should have the right to know if they are eating GM food,The consumer right to information about food must over-ride debate about pros and cons of GM food,765,"The frontpage of today's Daily Mail is dominated by the headline, ""Let Farms Grow GM Says PM's Top Scientist"". The paper has long warned its readers about the perceived dangers of GM foods. A decade or so ago, its persistent campaigning on the issue was a key reason why the ""frankenfood"" moniker gained traction and why shoppers – and hence supermarkets – turned their back on the technology. So it is noteworthy that one of the country's most influential newspapers should now choose to return to the topic – which has largely remained on the back burner for a decade – with such prominence. The top line of the story itself is fairly innocuous. After all, we already knew that this government – and the last – were broadly supportive of the technology, as have been this and previous chief scientific advisors. What's new and concerning for the Mail, I suspect, is the comment by Sir Mark Walport that GM food is ""inexorably rising up the agenda again because as a technology it is showing its value more and more"". The winds are changing, it seems, and the Mail senses its readers won't like that. However, the more interesting detail in the story - from my perspective, at least (for what it's worth, you can read my own views on GM here) - is about mid-way through: Earlier this month, four major supermarkets ended bans on farm suppliers giving GM feed to animals producing meat, milk and eggs. The vast majority of those foods sold in Britain will now come from animals raised on a GM diet. However, a survey by the Food Standards Agency last year found two in three people believe food from animals given a GM diet should be described as such. The debate about the safety of GM food will, no doubt, continue for some time yet. There are zealots on both sides of the argument who seem determined to talk past each other. The more nuanced ethical debate about the corporate control and supply of GM food technologies will also persist. However, one thing I think should and could be resolved is the issue of labelling. Here are the current labelling laws, according to the Food Standards Agency: In the EU, if a food contains or consists of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), or contains ingredients produced from GMOs, this must be indicated on the label. For GM products sold 'loose', information must be displayed immediately next to the food to indicate that it is GM. But there has long been a loophole, to the great annoyance of those seeking to eliminate any foods made using GM technologies – even in a secondary capacity - from their diet: Products produced with GM technology (cheese produced with GM enzymes, for example) do not have to be labelled. Products such as meat, milk and eggs from animals fed on GM animal feed also do not need to be labelled. Earlier this year, the FSA held a short consultation (pdf) – which has yet to report its findings - to see if there was any appetite to ""harmonise"" GM labelling rules across the EU. For example, Austria, Germany and France have introduced national schemes will allow consumers to know that any food they buy is ""GM free"". However, some other countries, according to the FSA, believe ""it is better to give consumers information about the presence of something in food rather than its absence"". This issue has raised its head beyond the EU, too. Last year in California, the controversial ""Prop 37"" ballot saw the pro-GM lobby win a narrow victory over the antis to retain the right in the state not to force food labels to carry information about whether the product contains GM ingredients. However, I think this labelling issue should be assessed without the distracting noise of the GM debate influencing it. There is something far more fundamental at play. Consumers should have the right to know what's in the food they eat – and know how it was produced. Period. End of. We've been through too many food scandals – the horsemeat scandal being just the latest saga – to know this to be true. Full transparency and easy access to detailed information are key to restoring and retaining public confidence in food. It is not enough to just say to someone they should buy organic if they seek such a guarantee - not everyone can afford to do so. If some people wish (as they clearly do) to avoid GM food – for whatever reason – they should have the information at hand on the labelling to allow them to do so.",,0.18612221112221114
148,article,environment/blog/2013/apr/16/jeremy-grantham-food-oil-capitalism,Environment,2013-04-16,Jeremy Grantham on how to feed the world and why he invests in oil | Leo Hickman,https://gu.com/p/3f64v,News,Jeremy Grantham on how to feed the world and why he invests in oil,The co-founder of investment group GMO on what books he's reading and why he wants to fund 'avant garde' farming,5221,"Yesterday, I posted part one of the transcript from my Saturday Guardian interview with Jeremy Grantham, the environmental philanthropist and the legendary fund manager. Here's part two... Jeremy Grantham on what first led him to engage with environmental issues: It started [in the mid-1990s] with a visit to the Amazon and to Borneo with the kids. And without thinking about it you start talking about the logs along the side of the river and the lack of mature forests in Borneo. We were on family trips and happened to do a couple of tropical forests back to back. I'm sure that played a role, but we didn't treat it as an epiphany. I would argue that one of our children got there first. While we were environmentalists, but low key, one of my sons happened to get a job which saw him end up in a dry tropical forest in Paraguay for five years and then off into the forestry business. Shortly behind that, we [his investment company GMO] began to follow that interest in forestry. We started our own forestry operation 15 years ago [at GMO] because our interest in forestry and of our realisation that land is so important. Forests were mispriced and were an attractive investment. My interest in forestry at that point was entirely commercial and then it began to morph into a decent investment, plus, ""look how important these forests are to maintain fresh water, carbon sequestration, etc""… I picked up none of that [James Hansen's 1988 testimony before Congress on climate change and the 1992 Rio Earth Summit]. No. Absolutely not. I was following along afterwards [once the foundation launched in 1997] asking the big NGOs where was the leverage for the birds flying through Costa Rica and Panama. Let's put our money there. Where were the hotspots? The climate question wasn't there for me at that time. Now it is at least half of the focus for the foundation. And in the other half it brushes up against climate all the time. We are late arrivals to all this and I have nothing but admirations to those who beat me to the punch by a few decades. On why his environmental interests moved beyond habitat conservation: I was a moderate environmentalist 10-15 years ago. But then I started to get embroiled in resources and that [the rise in price of] oil was the first paradigm shift that we'd ever come across in an important asset class, and nothing is more important than oil. I realised that the price of oil had changed forever and is not going back to the old $15 a barrel. There had been a majorly important shift. That led us to asking the question, why only oil? Why not every finite resource? And so we ended up about four years ago saying, ""watch out, we seem to be running out of things"". Two years ago, we did a very detailed paper which took on a life of its own and helped to put these issues onto institutional agenda items, I think. That led me to the realisation, by looking at the data, that between population growth and China gobbling up the world that the world had changed – and dangerously so – and hidden under that that oil and food were the two most dangerous components and within that [the availability of] phosphorous was perhaps the most dangerous long-term issue of all. Digging into the phosphate problem, you realised that it can be handled, but only if the great majority of the world is fed via sustainable farming which means nurturing the soil and having it once again full of micro-organisms. If you kill them every year with herbicides and pesticides then you're dealing basically with sand. You've got to restore and renew the ability to grow by re-applying all the nutrients in very big, expensive doses every year. This is in contrast to well-nurtured soil. There's a 30-year patch in Pennsylvania at the Rodale Institute where they've never put on any phosphorous at all and they are getting productivity equal to regular farming up the road. We arrived at all this just by looking at the numbers and the more I did the more I became concerned that we were already deep into a food crisis. Arab Spring countries were already getting throttled a bit by rising price of energy and food. They don't spend 8-10% of their budget on these, they spend 40%. So when that starts to double on you, you can see how quickly why people take to the streets. And that's where we are. The rich countries are really not that concerned and their casual behaviour is only serving to push up the price which is not that big a deal to them, certainly not the movers and shakers who make all the money. But it's a terrible deal for the poor half of the world and a disaster for the poorest 10% or so. That's the world we're in and it could lead to country after country being destabilised. It has forced me to go back and read all the classics. On my iPad I think I have 40 or so books now. I recommend a book by a scholar who summarises all these works back to Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. It's called Immoderate Greatness: Why Civilisations Fail by William Ophuls. And then there's perhaps my favourite book of a more detailed type which is called Dirt: The Erosion of Civilisation [by David R Montgomery]. That's a really good read. Then there's Collapse by Jared Diamond, which seems to have done quite well and is reasonable. A lot of details are queried by the experts in the field, but I thought it was fine. Then there are books on peak oil and shortages of raw materials. Books on the whole package of long-term growth on a finite planet, going back to the Limits to Growth and a book by one of the co-authors that looks at the next 40 years. That's called 2052 [by Jorgen Randers]. And so on and so forth. On the strengths and weaknesses of capitalism: Capitalism does millions of things better than the alternatives. It balances supply and demand in an elegant way that central planning has never come close to. However, it is totally ill-equipped to deal with a small handful of issues. Unfortunately, today, they are the issues that are absolutely central to our long-term wellbeing and even survival. It doesn't think long-term very well because of high discount rate structure. If you're a typical corporation anything lying out 30 years literally doesn't matter. Or, as I like to say: QED, your grandchildren have no value. And they usually act as if that was true, even though I'm sure they are actually very kind to their grandchildren. My favourite story is about the contract between the farmer and the devil. The devil says, ""sign this contract and I'll triple your farm's profits"". But there are 25 footnotes, as there always is with the devil. Footnote 22 says that 1% of your soil will be eroded each year, which is actually horrifyingly close to the real average over the past 50 years. The farmer signs and makes a fortune on a 40-year contract. And his son then signs up for the next 40-year contract and makes a fortune. And his son then signs up for the third and final contract. He still does very well, and in the final 20 years the family has accumulated enormous wealth, but the soil has gone. It's the same story for all his neighbouring farms and everyone is out of business. My sick joke is that at least he will die a rich farmer when all the starving hordes arrive from the city. Every graduate who took Econ 101 would probably sign that contract. There is no single theory that is used in economics that considers the finite nature of resources. It's shocking. But not as shocking as the pathetic waste of space over the last 50 years given to ""rational expectations"", which allows a whole generation of bankers and central bankers to believe that the market is efficient. None of it applies to the real world, or to messy human beings, many of whom are a little crooked when they have to be. It's been a disaster and a complete waste of time. It has been remarked before that modern economics is belief in a perpetual motion machine. Capital and labour, but no mention of energy. Without energy the whole thing grinds to a halt and the whole theory is demonstrated to be totally false. I'm late in the game at recognising this. One of my new heroes is an economist called Kenneth Boulding who, at 22, got a paper into Keynes's journal. At the age of about 50 he realised that economics was not taking its job seriously, that it was not interested in utility, in real serious improvement in the world, but that it was increasingly interested in new, elegant mathematical theories designed to get career advancement, over usefulness. He said the only people who believe you can have compound growth in a finite world are either mad men or economists. He also said: ""Mathematics has brought rigor to economics. Unfortunately, it also brought mortis."" On whether there's any conflict in him (via GMO and/or his foundation) investing in oil and gas companies? The first point is that each fund we have at GMO – maybe 80 or so – is run by its own team. I don't think that money management can easily have too many rules coming down from the top. Our first responsibility is to make money for our clients. I'm happy to write them letters trying to persuade them to do this, that and the other, but if they choose not to, that is their choice, not ours. We should just be a conduit for the client's decision on ethics. They will usually sign up for a strategy for which quite a lot of institutions have the same portfolio. My job as the quarterly-letter writer is to try and influence the game a bit, but it has to be done in a firm like ours at the top level. The solitary factor that might appear to be an exception is that we are getting close to the decision [at GMO] not to carry coal stocks and anything that has a material amount of tarsands. We have a resource fund which, of course, has stuff in the ground. It owns oil and gas companies, but it does not own coal companies or tarsands enterprises. I have written in Fortune magazine that those extreme, dangerous, carbon-intensive and polluting resources run the very substantial risk of being stranded assets because, on one hand, I think the progress of solar and wind is moving faster than most investors realise and, on the other, I expect the continuous rise in the price of hydrocarbons as we continue to move through the cheap stuff and move on to the more expensive stuff in terms of getting it out of the ground. And I don't think that if you put billions of dollars into a new tarsands project that you will see a decent return on it. It will be underpriced by solar, wind and other alternatives which are moving at considerable speed. And point two is they will slap a carbon tax on coal and tarsands which increasingly countries here and there will do – and, eventually, the US in the hopefully not-too-distant future – and that will be a death blow. If all this doesn't make these investments unprofitable, they will be very lucky. The probability of them running into trouble is too high for me to take that risk as an investor. If you look at the damage and you adopt a practical triage attitude, what you realise quickly is that every barrel of good, old-fashioned, relatively cheap oil will be pumped, as will every cubic foot of old-fashioned, low-cost natural gas. The real damage to the environment is the massive reserves of coal and tarsands, and elaborate, high-cost secondary/tertiary recovery of oil and gas. That's where the battle will be fought out and, frankly, that's going to turn out to be 60%-70% of the potential damage to the planet and we, with a bit of luck, can adjust to a world that uses up its conventional oil and gas if we behave well and drag that period out into the distant future. A lot of it will be used as chemical feedstock which is a higher and better use than using those precious resources as a fuel. Fracking enters the grey area. It's not old-fashioned natural gas that desires to burst to the top under its own free will. You have to torture it out of solid rock and that takes extra energy and extra pollution, and so on. That's why it is a grey-area fuel and that runs some risk of eventually becoming too high cost… The [Grantham] foundation can invest in anything it wants. It would be nice to make lots of money [for the foundation]. I believe there are certain forms of sustainable farming that will indeed perform well in the stock market and as an investment. This is not the money that we give out as grants each year. This is the principle behind it. So it's good to have some influence on both ends. [At GMO] we don't aim to have more than 10-15% in farms and forestry. The funds we run for clients are, to a certain degree, neutral on ethical issues. If there is a demand from the client – which I hope there will be – to have more green and sustainable funds, I hope GMO will do it one day. But in the meantime, with my foundation, I am the client, so it is entirely my right to set our own ethical standards. For the record, for the foundation I also approve the purchase of oil companies. I just won't buy coal and tarsands, for the reasons I've given. I reserve the right at a later date to say that one or two oil companies are simply too badly behaved. I haven't done that yet, partly because I don't have the required information. It also involves different interpretations of effectiveness and propaganda. I have an honest disagreement with Bill McKibben. Our foundation helps fund his efforts and I have great admiration for him. But I have argued with him that there's probably more juice to be had by going to the campuses and getting the students to stamp their feet that the college endowment should get rid of all their coal and tarsands investments because they can do that. For the record, we need oil. If we took oil away tomorrow, civilisation ends. We all starve. It's a little impractical and idealistic [to abandon oil immediately], perhaps. Now I understand there are other big issues, such as what does it take to concentrate the mind of a student and get them enthusiastic. In the long run, the carbon equation that Bill McKibben has gloriously helped to popularise in Rolling Stone is in front of everyone's nose. We've got five times the amount of carbon reserves to cook our goose. The question is what can we get away with and what sends the biggest signal. My thinking is that, if we could get dozens and dozens of colleges and foundations to sign up to getting rid of coal and tarsands, we're attacking something that is doable at the portfolio level – the college is not going to feel that is a tremendous encumbrance for them to optimise their return – but it represents 60-70% of the whole climate problem. By my reckoning, it's a very focused and efficient strategy. And when everything has been disposed of and there's a groupthink on the issue it's a very powerful statement to send rattling round the world. Coal and tarsands are not even 1% of a typical portfolio. Oil and gas, as one of the biggest industries out there, is huge, but coal and tarsands is negligible. Far better to nail that and send a very powerful signal. And why wouldn't the colleges sign up because it's very good business. I love the idea when you have an environmental argument backed by a good economic argument. I would like to concentrate my efforts in those areas. I understand the principle entirely of not interfering [with a fund manager's decision-making], but I wouldn't dream of doing that unless I believed the pay-off was very large and the penalty for doing nothing was very high. I think there is a wonderful case for a prestigious, leading university to have their endowment officially to take into account the long-term effect on the environment - not blanket forbidding this, that and the other, but just taken into account in a sensible way. There are other advantages, too. Rather like the corporations who have become quite green and project that image, the people who have signed up for a job have broadened a bit and as they build that image it has become a commercial advantage. It might be that only 10-20% of the graduating population of the top students are interested in the long-term wellbeing of the planet, but it's a measurable number and it's getting bigger and it's enough to be commercially interesting. If you are losing 20% of the brightest students because you have an undesirable image then you had better start to change it. This is one of the soft underbellies of the capitalist system and it's one way that they are impacted by, let's call it, good behaviour and sustainability in the broadest sense. It would also apply to students applying for college. On good, long-term investments: My view of food leads me to believe that a spectacular investment is in farm land and in forestry. Or, if you prefer it, land. They don't make any more of it, as they say. Fifteen years ago we started a forestry division [at GMO] because I had fallen in love with land and trees and because I realised it was a mispriced asset class. We have done extremely well in that sector outperforming the benchmark for 15 years. I think farm land is a terrific investment area. But that doesn't mean that some mid-western land isn't ahead of itself because of recent grain prices. It's a very inefficient asset class and every farm is different, but you can hunt around the edge, and outside America, and you can find a decent return in an equity market that is becoming, in the US at least, rather overpriced. If you were to buy a farm, and I would be urging any buyer to think in terms of the sustainability of the farming technique, but here again our farming portfolio is relatively green but it's not by any means limiting itself to sustainable or organic farming. My foundation, on the other hand, is at the early stages of what I hope to be a long and interesting experiment of investing in this kind of more avant garde sustainable farming. As we discover useful information and potentially profitably information we will pass it on to our GMO unit for the clients' benefit. On where he plans to take his foundation next: We've recently become very aware of the fact that as our knowledge base accumulates so rapidly, our learning curve is so steep, that the point of maximum sensitivity is shifting so we are quite grateful that we can't commit all our resources on one project. Now we're beginning to think, perhaps, we should cool it for a year or two, because our learning curve is so steep, and wait to see. But if I had a magic wand it would be energy storage. Secondly, alternative energy, in general. And, perhaps, co-equally, farming and looking ahead to the next problem of how do we move the world to sustainable farming. We could go to a couple of leading farm research universities and ask what does it take to beef up the programme and to train organic farmers and to publicise it so that every young man or woman with an urge to think about this can go and get a good training. They don't really exist, by the way. The three people on the planet who do exist might write in and protest, but it's insignificant, a rounding error compared to the training in ""Big Ag"". One could have quite an effect, such is the small base. Research into organic farming - there's been fairly minimal research into the intermediate crops that you can put on between the cash crops. They flower two weeks too late, or early, to be convenient. One of things we tried to do last year, but failed because we couldn't buy a farm, was to scale up the efforts of the very best organic system which had only taken place on very small plots. We were going to buy enough land to offer a project where they would have 350 acres each, maybe three of them, and would have three years to work out which system was best. We wanted to see how close to Big Ag you could get in productivity. In half-acre lots they can get to parity. Could you do that with 350 acres? And they used far less of the expensive in-puts and increasingly less as the years go by. And as the price of fertiliser and fuel rises that becomes more and more commercial, so it will be pushing in favour of sustainable farming and it will continue to push until its fully commercial. But in the meantime, it would be nice to save 5-10 years along that road by doing trials. We would like to be able to start doing a few things like that that will save a few years when it matters… We're moving quite fast on various types of highly improved organic farming, upgrades to land, sequestered carbon, doubling of cattle capabilities, re-considering marginal land that had been degraded. It might not fall with organic certification standards, but it takes those principles and concentrates on developing sustainable methods of food production… We [at the foundation] also want to project the argument for sensible behaviour in a world where the news media is full of anti-science nonsense. Heartbreakingly, the Guardian is an island amid remarkably bad British coverage of the environment, much worse, on average, than in the US. The newspaper industry [in the UK] has covered itself in shit when it comes to environmental reporting, except the Guardian. The TV is much worse in America than the UK, though. An accident of history. On genetically modified food: I can tell you where I stand today [on GM crops] and I will have to tell you again next year. That's part of the reason why we want to do these trials to find out exactly what you can do in terms of sustainability and simultaneously ask the question of what are the compromises. How much would it hurt your productivity and cost structure to move to a more hybrid version of organic? Is it a bargain given that pure organic gets a big premium? It may well be that hybrid form of farming may give you the best output per unit of sustainability, but the most money per unit may well come from total organic following the rule book and picking up a 50% premium for your product… On whether organic food can ""feed the world"": We have a 50% surplus of food, as we speak. We have tons of waste and a decent amount of land and huge areas which can be increased in efficiency by going organic in, say, Africa. If hypothetically someone said to you we all must change to organic across the board, you wave your wand and everyone does it, your productivity drops by 18%. We can absorb that today. By if we wait 30-40 years and have an 18% hit they all starve. On ""austerity"", debt and monetary policy: Fiscal and monetary policies are extraordinarily difficult at the moment. The history is not clear as to what works. The theory is even less clear. My guess is that you want to be careful about how quickly you tighten the austerity screws and that the more austerity-orientated approaches look to me more dangerous and seem to be delivering greater pain on the economy. Eventually, you have to address the question of debt, but I'm on the record as saying that I think the world in general exaggerates the significance of debt. That isn't to say it's insignificant, but what it is to say is that it's a paper world and it takes our attention away from the real world of the quality of education and training and the quality and quantity of capital investment and legal structure. We don't build things on paper and yet we've begun to talk as if we do. People say that the Chinese have built all their railroads on debt, to which I say, ""no, they haven't"". They've built them with real Chinese people and real cement and real steel that are part of the real world. When you run out of people and capital capacity then you can't increase any more. America conducted the world's greatest experiment in debt. It tripled the debt-to-GDP level from 1982, where it was 1.25x GDP, up to 3.5x over the next 30 years. And during this time what effect did this have on the long-term growth of the system? And that's the only reason they do it, just to get more growth? Everyone says that, of course, the financial burst caused devastation and brought us to our knees. Yes, it was a terrible idea and eminently avoidable, but if you look at the breaking of the housing bubble in America and you realise how many trillions of dollars would evaporate if it went back to the trend line of the ratio of house price to family income, you must realise that people are going to feel devastatingly poorer than they were. They still have the same house, but, in perception terms, they thought they had a pension fund stored up in their house and it went away. They feel poor and they are going to spend less and it will be a drag on the economy. It was a well-behaved bubble. It went extraordinarily high then all the way back in three years to trend line, and slightly below, and is now moving back up to trend. It was a huge hit to the economy and guaranteed the recovery would be slow. And if that was not enough there was a second factor – the price of oil quadrupled and the price of other assets, such as metals and food, tripled from 2002-2008. Every time that had happened before, like 1974 and 1979 in the two oil crisis, it was followed by global recession. That alone should have been enough to cause a recession. Add that to the housing bust and you don't need to create any space to explain why we had a recession and a slow recovery. I remain open to persuasion that debt is that big a deal. We have had it foisted upon us that the general idea that finance is so incredibly important that, if a corner bank goes bust, the whole of civilisation grinds to a halt. It's enormously helpful to the banking system to have believed such nonsense, but I think that's what it is. On the human species' chances of overcoming its environmental challenges: Whether we have the nous to pull it off is an interesting question, but I think the odds are we will scrape through. Not that we deserve to. [Laughs]. It's a 50/50 shot that declining fertility rates and alternative energy will save our bacon. But nature and development don't run on a puritan basis of just punishment. It's often sheer luck. It's sheer luck we found hydrocarbons. It's sheer bad luck that carbon dioxide has a greenhouse effect. It's sheer bad luck that the oil industry has incredible vested power and is prepared to use it to delay the speed of our reaction… It isn't that we can't do it, it's that the Anglo-Saxon countries – where, by the way, there is a vast concentration of oil companies – are rather intractable on this issue and they've managed to find a little army of non-scientific, persuasive ""loony lords"", as I call them, to argue the case, either because they like being wined and dined by the enemy, or because they're naturally contrarian and like the publicity, or that they are genuine idiots. Who knows? I'm always puzzled by the modus of these people. What we forget at the end of all this is Pascal's Wager. What is the penalty for acting as if this was really serious? You spend some money and end up with wonderfully cheap alternative energy? Big deal. Or you continue acting as if it's trivial and keep listening to the loony lords and doing nothing and having it cripple the planet as we know it? If the potential threat is big enough – like insuring your house, it's a necessary payment even though you don't expect the house the burn down – any sensible person who understands Pascal's Wager will agree to that. It's simply asymmetrical. The downside risk of this getting out of control is massive. The penalty for spending more money than you should have done because as it turns out, for scientific reasons, we have completed messed up and it's not as bad as we thought, are very modest in cost by comparison. That's the killer argument for any rational person, but, as we know, this is not about rationality. It's about our unwillingness to process unpleasant information. And the unwillingness of vested interests to stop funding this damn stuff. On the Manhattan Project: The Manhattan Project was brilliant and is the highpoint of our achievements as a species. Anyone who says government can't do this, or can't do that, I say a pox on you, have a look at the Manhattan Project. They did remarkable things. They were outside the box. They stuck the brightest minds out in the desert. They were herding cats with great egos, but it worked. Amazing effort. If we did that on alternative energy we are home free. Even half that. It was our best-ever response to a problem. Civilisations have fallen for the lack of something like that. For once, we came up with the right response, but you can't count on that being our natural reflex as a species. If it was, we would have analysed the problem of climate change and energy, and decided it was a bigger threat than Hitler. But we didn't get a Pearl Harbour or invasion of Poland. We're not programmed to respond to vague, problematical - you can't put a precise number on it – and the long term. That is not our strength. We're much better when the tiger attacks and the bombs drop. [Superstorm] Sandy was probably the closest thing we've had [in the US] to a Pearl Harbour moment in terms of moving public opinion of whether climate change is real.",,0.08479406093396924

As I have done for my interviews with the likes of Al Gore, Bill McKibben and James Lovelock (in 2010 and 2012), I have taken the time to transcribe the full interview so readers can see what Grantham said in the kind of detail that the print edition of the Guardian can't provide. The interview lasted three hours, so I have split the transcript in two. I will publish part two tomorrow, but here's part one... Jeremy Grantham on why he has stepped up his environmental activities: It's data driven. We [the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment] were gracefully moving into the environment, save these animals and habitats, and all these good things, then the data on resources - starting about four years ago – made me realise that some of these were really urgent. That we were already entering a food crisis, for example. This time last year I thought it was clear from the data that we were already five years into a food crisis and it is highly unlikely to go away. And unless we get our act together it is likely to become a cascading problem. On how much time we have to tackle the world's environmental problems: We're already in a bad place. We're on a sliding scale. The language ""it's too late"" is very unsuitable for most environmental issues. It's too late for the dodo and for people who've starved to death already, but it's not too late to prevent an even bigger crisis. The sooner we act on the environment, the better. The sooner we cut off the carbon dioxide going into the air, etc. The worse accidents we will prevent from happening are 20, 30, 40 years from now. The same applies to food. The faster we act to improve the situation, the fewer Africans – North Africans, in particular – will come to grief. What is happening through the market mechanism is that the rich countries, by being unnecessarily sloppy – and by the Chinese getting richer in a real hurry and eating more meat – we are pricing up grain so that the poor are getting hungry. It's hard to see this stopping in the immediate future. It's also very hard to see the poor and hungry getting richer at the same speed as the way we are driving up the price of grain. On feeding a growing human population: There is a stretching disparity between the haves and have nots. It's not the win-win of globalisation that we all grew up with studying in Econ 101. The irony is that as China gets richer, it burns more coal. They put pressure on the global environment and on global grain prices. So in order to give them a nice middle class, variegated diet, they could cause poorer Asians and Africans to starve. There is no mechanism to prevent that. Egypt runs a trade deficit. Their population is programmed to grow dramatically. Three million at the time of Napoleon. Eighty-three million, said their standard when they marched into the Olympic Games last year. And they're on their way to 140m. They've always been very efficient, but they can't feed much more than half their people. The price of grain from about 2002-2008 – a tiny window – tripled. Why did it grow so sharply? We knew population was growing, but it was growing steadily, if dramatically. When I was born there were two billion, now there are seven billion. It's the kind of curve than anyone in finance would look at and jump nervously, when you see an exponential curve like that. That's one factor, but nothing particular to the period of 2002-2008… On the rising price of oil: …2002 was a nothing year. The only numbers I was paying attention to in 2002 was for oil. A little wheel was turning at the back of my brain that noted that oil was beginning to act differently. Our firm specialises in the study of investment bubbles. We have the best data. Over the years, we have put together a database that has 330 bubbles of which about 40 are really important ones. What we found about the important bubbles is that every single one had burst completely back to the original trend. Three years up to something triple, and then three years down. They actually tend to go down a little more quickly than they went up, which is surprising. But they always broke. I used to specialise in asking financial audiences to give me an example of the paradigm shift, a major shift in a major financial asset class. And never was one offered. Six years ago I wrote about the paradigm shift in the New York Times. It had 100 years of oil prices – very volatile, but a very central, steady trend line of about 16 dollars a barrel in today's currency. But then around OPEC in 1972/3, the price trend leaps up to $36. On the unwillingness to process unpleasant data: I find the parallels between how some investors refuse to recognise the trends and our reaction to some of our environmental challenges very powerful. There is an unwillingness to process unpleasant data. In a bull market you want to believe good news. You don't want to hear that the market is going to go off a cliff. You don't want to listen to the climate people who are telling you it is getting worse and even worse unless you do this and that. You want to listen to the good news. There were always people willing to tell you that smoking was OK and that stuff about cancer was exaggerated. There's a professor at MIT who defended tobacco who now defends carbon dioxide saying it seems to have lost its greenhouse effect, or whatever. And then there are the vested interests. They are the single most powerful force because you are dealing with an audience who wants to hear good news and into the stock market come all the bullish stock market giant firms telling you everything's fine because they love bull markets because they make a fortune. They don't even mind crashes because they don't do so badly there either. What they would die at is if the market went up at its long-term trend line at 1.8%, plus inflation, a year. But we're not going back to 2% growth. Maybe we'll do 1% and it will be reported as 1.5% and once again people don't want to hear that. They want to hear Ben Bernanke's news that it should return to 3%... Me calling bubbles correctly is all data driven and based on the optimism that is built into humans. Every time we see a bubble, we see an army of people screaming, ""No, no, it's not a bubble, everything is fine."" We see the climate and scores of people screaming the same that everything is fine, or that it's a plot. It's par for the course. The general public don't want to hear it and will choose to listen to the optimistic interpretation. It's a real uphill struggle. You don't stop the bubble really until the damage is done. It goes so high that it can't sustain itself and just pops. And maybe that will happen here and our job is to try to do a better job than we did in the tech bubble. On climate sceptics: The misinformation machine is brilliant. As a propagandist myself [he has previously described himself as GMO's ""chief of propaganda"" in reference to his official title of ""chief investment strategist""], I have nothing but admiration for their propaganda. [Laughs.] But the difference is that we have the facts behind our propaganda. They're in the ""screaming loudly"" rather than the ""fact based"" part of the exercise, because they don't have the facts. They are masters at manufacturing doubt. What I have noticed on the blogs and in the comments section under articles is that over several years, as the scientific evidence for climate change gets stronger, the tone of the sceptics is getting shriller and more vicious and nastier all the time. The equivalent on the other side is a weary resignation, sorrow and frustration and amazement that people on the other side can't look at the facts. The sceptics are getting angrier and more vicious every year despite the more storms we have, and the more mad crazy weather we have… One of the problems is that typically you are not dealing with the facts. Putting in more facts makes the sceptics more angry. They have profound beliefs – as opposed to knowledge – that they are willing to protect by all manner of psychological tricks. So you have people who are very smart - even great analysts and hedge fund managers - who on paper know that their argument is wrong, but who promote it fiercely because they are libertarians. Libertarians believe that any government interference is bad. Anyone with a brain knows that climate change needs governmental leadership and they can smell this is bad news for their philosophy. Their ideology is so strongly held that remarkably it's overcoming the facts. They are using incredible ingenuity to steer their way around facts that they do not choose to accept philosophically. Laying down more facts just makes them more angry. You may win over a few neutrals. They are the people you can win over. But it's very hard to win over the hardcore sceptics, of which there are plenty. We can try to bypass them on one level and we try to contest the political power of the sceptics. They are using money as well as propaganda to influence the politicians, particularly in America. It almost doesn't even exist in countries outside the US, UK and Australia. A cynic would say that the petrol-chemical industry also happens to be Anglo-Saxon. Where are the great oil companies based? They still have great power. The oil companies seem to have pulled back from directly supporting climate sceptics over the past few years because - in England, in particular - they were embarrassed and it became untenable to be so obvious. But they're still influential. You don't have go via back-channels any more, courtesy of the US Supreme Court, because it is completely legal for a corporation to invest tons of money in advertising programmes to say who is good and who is bad in a race for the Senate without even asking permission from the people who actually own the company. Corporations are treated as human beings and money is treated as having the right to speak. There's dark money and light money. The anonymity they adopt is legal. They don't have to say who their donors are. It is quite remarkable. And then you get the Something Something for the Environment, which are actually just sceptics funded by the bad guys. And then there are the thinktanks who have become propaganda-tanks. I used to respect the Cato Institute when it came out with reports on this, that and the other, and they have received a lot of hydrocarbon funding. But when the University of East Anglia break-in was engineered they had something like 20 press conferences the following month. The response to the break-in was almost immediate and co-ordinated. I don't think it was suspiciously rapid, but I do think it was unusually and unexpectedly rapid. It's very likely that it was simply a terrific response of their behalf. They moved very fast. The good guys are learning slowly, but surely, to step up their response time… If you're saying something that people don't want to hear or accept, a significant proportion of them will reply with hostility. Not because they know the facts, or because they have researched it themselves, but because they're so psychologically involved in believing good news that they will oppose it with a reflex. In addition, if the solutions proposed sound like they involve the government, you will have all the political rightwing try to block it as a reflex, even if it means them overriding hard science, which is what's going on today. Changing people's minds is almost impossible, even among scientists. Max Planck said, to paraphrase, that science advances one funeral at a time. You could add that economics advances the same way. You have to wait to get rid of the people who have career investment in a topic before a new generation can see the light. On the UK's unseasonably cold spring in 2013, and recent icy winters: The scientists are getting very concerned privately – they are conservative in public and have yet to write it up – that blocking processes are sticking in the system. The jet stream is behaving very strangely. One very senior atmospheric scientist said to me recently off the record that we are liable to wake up one day and find ourselves on the latitude – which we are in the UK – of Montreal. It's a liveable place, but not like London. They have underground tunnels because of their winters. The Gulf Stream is having a few wobbles, too, and the theory there is the melting in Greenland and the Arctic is creating a lot of cold, fresh water, which is a possible source for loss of power in the conductor, so it moves less warm water up from the Caribbean. On how he chooses where to spend his foundation's money: We don't fund the hard science of solar technology. That would take hundreds of millions. But what we are funding is bringing together the data and put it together and representing it conveniently to the outside world. And we want to train people with a good range of skills so they can produce good PhDs for the future at LSE and Imperial. We also fund old-fashioned style investigative journalism which is dying out in newspapers because the newspaper industry has become incredibly tough. The first people to get fired were the environmental journalists. We had a prize for environmental journalism which we brought in at the top of the market, but we discontinued it last year because there was basically no leverage left for the two-and-a-half environmental journalists left. All we were interested in was the net result of whether it could produce a more effective presentation of the facts. We got going in the nick of time to see that it could drag up environmental journalism, but then all the ""dragees"" were suddenly looking for different jobs, or put on different beats. Or that they were already working for the handful of independent investigative organisations. We fund about a dozen fledgling journalistic projects. Our argument was they are all fledgling so let's fund them all first, then winnow them down later – come back in 3-4 years and pick eight and, a couple of years later, pick five. In the end, it doesn't matter if there are one or two, but that they are the best. They whole point really is to allow these people to do their thing and to play to their skills and to pick the people who are highly motivated and very skilled. None of them would be very happy if we tried to tell them what precisely to do and we don't know what they should do. On assessing if the money his foundation spends has achieved its objectives: It's a great problem for philanthropists and NGOs. The problems where you can measure the impact are not common in the environmental field. If you can measure them, they tend to be over decades. One is the wildlife population of Namibia. That is by far and away the most successful [conservation project the foundation has funded], by the way. You can see the population of the various types of antelope have improved. But that is unusual. But the ones you feel are most important are the vaguest of them all. How do measure the shift in attitudes towards processing the data? There are guys working on studying the changes in attitudes in the media. But you have to take a leap of faith that they are smart and dedicated. On whether he tries to persuade other philanthropists to support his causes: No, I don't. We might discuss such things informally over lunch. There's a handful of hedge fund managers, mainly, who have decided to be aggressive about the environment, thank heavens. This doesn't exist in England where you could get them all on the finger of one hand. I can try to persuade them. I gave a talk in London recently at the head office of a major financial player and someone went to considerably effort to make sure a couple of hundred potential philanthropists and wealthy individuals were there for me to have a go at them. A lot of them left their business cards and if you do that you are kind of asking for trouble. [Laughs.] I believe the majority left their cards, which as things go, is a huge potential hit because even if you get one or two that could be significant. They were a receptive audience. I try to paint the picture of how I got to where I am [as an investor] and then of how fact based the issues appear to be to me. I now try to add my thoughts about food and the ""carbon math""… On the ""carbon math"": …It's simple, comprehensible maths, as Bill McKibben explained in Rolling Stone last year. There are five times the amount of proven carbon reserves as we can possibly allow to be burned if we want to remain under 2C of warming, which is now not even considered to be a safe margin. We must burn just a fifth of what's there. We will burn all the cheap, high-quality oil and gas, but if we mean to burn all the coal and any appreciable percentage of the tarsands, or even third derivative, energy-intensive oil and gas, with fracking for shale gas on the boundary, then we're cooked, we're done for. Terrible consequences that we will lay at the door of our grandchildren. Some things might change very quickly, though. For example, the business mathematics of alternative energy are changing much faster than the well-informed business man realises. On the falling costs of alternative energy: Read my next quarterly newsletter entitled, ""The Race of Our Lives"", [will be available here] on why civilisations fall and why they've always fallen and why we may not because we have two advantages that they did not - a voluntary fall in fertility, which is just amazing, and alternative energy. Every wave of technology has seen an incremental increase in energy needed – steam engines, cars, air conditioning, iPads – they all add to our energy needs and mean we dig a deeper hole, but we feel we are making wonderful progress. But now we have a technology wave which protects us from needing to burn every last ton of coal. Solar, wind, biomass, intelligent grids, and storage - please, more storage - protect us. That is the best part of capitalism. The price of solar panels is now 25% of what it was two years ago and that's the bit people have missed. If these prices were to be held – they may not be – we are competitive, without a carbon tax, in the areas that have the sun - California, North Africa, Spain, etc. You can build a solar farm and it can be commercial. Meanwhile, the price of hydrocarbons are getting more expensive all the time, because you've extracted all the easy stuff first and with China rising and still growing at 7% a year. And that's just China. Don't forget India which actually has more coal power plants down to be built on the books at the moment than China. Now you start to get an idea of, wow, why this does not compute. If it computes, it's only at the enormous increase in cost of digging and shipping coal. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, solar and wind power are getting cheaper and cheaper. Those lines are going to cross big time in the next 20 years. There is no such thing as ""locked in and committed"" because you can reverse. They might build a few more coal-fired plants, but then they will stop completely. The pay-off for China of getting out of the way of those lines crossing is so great. On why China is his big hope: China is my secret weapon. I call them the Chinese cavalry riding to the rescue. They have the capital. They have an embarrassment of capital – 50% of their GDP is capital investment. We have a shortage of capital and also have debts. Their problem is how to invest all that capital. My partners worry all the time about them wasting their money. What better programme could they possibly have, with huge social pay-off, than a massive replacement of sustainable energy? When you think what it would mean to them – it would get rid of their pollution – it makes sense. Because of that pollution, they announced recently an incredible increase of 65% in their plans to install by 2015 – just three short years away – 36GW, which is equivalent to 20 vast, state-of-art coal plants, of solar. Throw in wind, too. And, by the way, we will have many breakthroughs in storage. If I had to make a bet, I would say that's the most promising, important breakthrough of the next several years. Everyone is working on this. If you have a big smart grid – and all the desert of Xinjiang and all the wind of Inner Mongolia – and it's all swirling around with relatively little loss and you have a grid smart enough to go in there Chinese-style and turn your fridge off for half an hour to save energy, and do this and do that, you don't need nearly the back-up. The bad guys will tell you that you need 100% back-up and messianic environmentalists will tell you that you need 0%. But maybe 20% back-up will be needed as everyone is working on storage. I'm certain it will happen. Some technologies take time then go, ""Bang!"". Look at video conferencing. It has been around forever and the quality was terrible. But now it is so clear and instant. Technology has a habit of boring you to death and disappointing you for 20 years then suddenly it delivers a new world… I have very high hopes for China because they have embedded high scientific capabilities in their leadership class. And that is huge. They know this is serious. They can calculate the social threat of getting this pollution, weather instability, water out of control. And they are acting much faster now than we are. They have it within their capabilities of coming back in 30 years with the guarantee of complete energy independence – all alternative and sustainable forever. They have an embarrassment of capital. We have an embarrassment of debt. So they can set a stunning pace, which they are doing. And they could crank it up. To hell with their five-year plans, they should move up to 25-year plans for alternative energy - energy security, reducing pollution and low cost. They would have such low-cost energy at the end of it they will be the terror of the capitalist system. With low energy and low labour, that's the ball game. Five years into a 25-year programme and any capitalist will be urging their government to copy them. On the Scandinavian countries: I am inspired by [them]. They have to cope with short-term election cycles and a parliamentary system and all four of them nevertheless act responsibly, not just on alternative energy and environmental issues, but also on social issues that matter. They are, by and large, models of good behaviour. They say in America to me what's the solution to all this, I say cede your government to Denmark. [Laughs]. They are good enough that they would get the job done. On environmentalism's track record of making predictions: Go and read Limits to Growth, which I did recently. They pretty much predicted doom and gloom 20 years from now. They have been grossly misinterpreted and are pretty much on schedule. There are details that are over and under, but it is amazingly accurate. The William Ophuls model is that we are hard-wired to collapse. Given half a chance we will over-reach. We are over-confident that we will solve every problem. But we will leave it too late and we will crash. All the confidence that people try to give you – the ""infinite capacity of the human brain"", unquote – all of that hinges on the apparent infinite supply of hydrocarbons. No civilisation looked durable and resilient until coal and then we acquired this amazing power. We are now coming to the end of that era. If we don't use that window to fix it and have a sustainable replacement, we are toast. Don't worry about peak oil, worry about peak temperature. All our flora and fauna has thrived in the last 10,000 years since the end of the last ice age, a period which has seen unbelievable stable weather by long-term standards. Now it is becoming unstable. If you drive the temperature above 40C, well-known brands of corn will not produce. They just stop. You might be able to twist and turn and get it to produce at 41C, and you might move further north in latitude, but temperatures rises are very bad news for grain. The wider point is it [temperature rise] is generally bad for everything that evolved in one stable environment. It has no resilience to produce outside the temperatures experiences during this 10,000 year period. Quite a few grains are now topping out in terms of productivity. I look around and I say just look at the food-producing problems we face. In fact, let's make it even simpler: look at the grain-producing problems we face around the world. We've just had three consecutive monster-bad grain harvests. Not one of those three poor harvests was more likely than a one-in-25-year harvest. But the terrible thing is they went, ""whack, whack, whack"". I took some grief when I wrote about the first one and said next year was bound to be less bad, but the next year became a monster. I've done more research and reading in the last two years than I ever did at college. I've read all the classics. All the limits to growth, all the end of civilisations stuff, all the peak everything stuff, all the soil destruction stuff. On confronting our environmental problems: Asking, ""Are we too late?"", is not the logic for this problem. It is too late for the dodo. It is too late for the one third of arable land that we have destroyed in 10,000 years. It's too late for 10% of global biodiversity, and almost certainly another 10%, and 50/50 for yet another 10% after that. But it would be nice to end up with a planet that we can still relate to, that still has a fairly handsome biodiversity. We can still do that. There is one chance that the real pessimists are right. The chance that on our way to a 4-8C rise, and a 10-15ft rise in the oceans, which is probably what's going to happen over the next two centuries, that things will get worse before they get better, because there is inertia built into the system. You can easily imagine resource wars breaking out unless we put our best foot forward on alternative energy. This would buy us time for everything else to be solved. If you can become energy sustainable in the next 40 years and suck up the pain that will have been paid by then, then you have probably bought the time for another 40 years to transfer the whole of global agriculture into a fully sustainable system before we run out of the resources to run old-fashioned agriculture. And if you do that then, in turn, you have probably bought enough time to deal with the intractable long-term issue of metals, which are entropy writ large. No matter how careful you are with them, they slip through your fingers. In the end, you will need to use organic replacements, which will take a long, long time [to develop]. We'd better start working on it now, but not too many are and they're not getting much funding. You've got to get the population down and you've got to ignore the Economist magazine and others talking about rising population as a terrible economic problem. It is a necessary, short-term, intermediate pain to pay for the absolute minimum hope of survival, which is a gracefully declining population, because if you don't do that you will have a rapidly imploding population one day.

But now the man who made billions by predicting every recent financial crisis is speaking out<br /><br />• <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2013/apr/15/jeremy-grantham-population-china-climate"">Read the transcript of the Grantham interview</a>",1700,"One icy morning in February, a train pulled into Washington DC. It was loaded with environmentalists planning to handcuff themselves to the gates of the White House, in protest at the building of a 3,500km oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Amid the hundreds of placard-carrying protesters stood a somewhat incongruous figure in a suit – Jeremy Grantham, a 74-year-old fund manager. ""What we are trying to do is buy time,"" he told reporters. ""Buy time for the world to wake up."" Grantham – who occupies a legendary place in the world of finance for predicting all the major stock market bubbles of recent decades (and doing very well in the process) – had decided, after 15 years of low-key environmental philanthropy, to, as he puts it, ""walk the walk"". ""I was committed to getting arrested,"" says Grantham, a tall, slight man, as he looks out across the City from his London office on the 15th floor of a glass-and-steel tower next to the Bank of England. He speaks machine gun-quickly in a soft, mid-Atlantic accent. ""But the day before [the protest] my wife checked with the lawyer, who said, 'Don't do that!'"" It turned out that being arrested would give him serious problems when it came to travelling. ""I've had a green card since completing my MBA at Harvard in 1964."" Grantham, co-founder and chief strategist of GMO, a Boston-based global investment group, manages $106bn (£69bn) of assets on behalf of 1,000 institutional investors, and employs 600 people, so he decided that the fallout would be too great. He was forced to stand back and watch as his daughter Isabel got arrested, alongside the actor Daryl Hannah, the US's highest-profile environmentalist Bill McKibben, and Nasa climate scientist James Hansen. So he is speaking out instead. From where he stands, this bubble, the ""carbon bubble"", is the biggest he's seen. ""We're already in a bad place. The worst accidents are [only] 20, 30, 40 years from now."" Such apocalyptic talk is often the preserve of deep-green doom-mongers – the kind of talk that has led many to reject environmentalism. But Grantham insists he's guided ""by the facts alone"". On some issues (immigration and education) he ""would be considered rightwing"", but with the environment, he says he calls it as he sees it. He is disdainful of those who ignore the data, or worse, misinform the public. ""I find the parallels between how some investors refuse to recognise trends, and our reaction to some of our environmental challenges, very powerful,"" he says. ""There is an unwillingness to process unpleasant data. In a bull market you want to believe good news. You don't want to hear that the market is going to go off a cliff."" He finds climate sceptics – led by a ""little army of non-scientific, persuasive loony lords"", as he characterises them (a barely disguised reference to the former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson and Ukip's Lord Monckton, both of whom promote, to varying degrees, climate-sceptic views) – a frustrating ideological phenomenon. ""They have profound beliefs – as opposed to knowledge – that they are willing to protect by all manner of psychological tricks. So you have people who are very smart – great analysts and hedge-fund managers – who on paper know that their argument is wrong, but who promote it fiercely because they are libertarians. Anyone with a brain knows that climate change needs governmental leadership, and they can smell this is bad news for their philosophy. They are using incredible ingenuity to steer their way around facts they do not choose to accept."" Grantham, who was born in Hertfordshire and raised by his Quaker grandparents in Doncaster, freely admits to being a ""late arrival to all this"". After completing a degree in economics at the University of Sheffield in the early 1960s, he worked for a short stint at Shell before going to Harvard for an MBA. In 1977, he co-founded GMO [Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo]. Making his clients – and himself – wealthy filled his working days until the mid-1990s. And then he went on holiday with his children, to the Amazon and Borneo. ""And without thinking about it, you start talking about the logs along the side of the river and the lack of mature forests in Borneo."" He smiles, seeing the risk of being accused of being driven by emotion rather than rigorous statistical analysis. ""That played a role, but we didn't treat it as an epiphany."" And he didn't preach. For years he has remained, Oz-like, behind the curtain of the environmental movement. He has shunned in-depth interviews and expressed his views only in quarterly newsletters published on GMO's website, where he writes of long-term risk, climate change and dwindling resources – not just oil, coal and natural gas, but also phosphorus and potash, whose use in modern farming methods ""must be drastically reduced in the next 20–40 years or poorer countries will begin to starve"". At the same time, he has poured an ever-larger amount of his personal wealth into his Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment, which he runs, with family input (his children are trustees) and minimal staff, out of GMO's Boston headquarters. The foundation's latest tax filing shows that in 2011 he increased the fund's coffers by $46m (£30m), bringing the total to something approaching $400m (£260m), up from $106m in 2006. Ever the wise moneyman, he has largely reinvested this money, in order to guarantee the foundation's long-term security. But he also spends about $17m annually on his chosen causes, in the process becoming, according to one magazine, the ""world's most powerful environmentalist"". Run your finger down the tax document and you see why. In 2011 alone, his foundation gave $1m to each of the leading US conservation charities, the Sierra Club and Nature Conservancy, as well as $2m to the Environmental Defense Fund, where his German-born wife Hannelore is a trustee and where Isabel has also worked. He is perhaps best known in the green world for funding the London School of Economics' Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment ($2.2m in 2011), and Imperial College London's Grantham Institute for Climate Change ($1.9m in 2011), but he funds climate researchers in India, too. He has written large cheques for the Carnegie Institute of Science, the Smithsonian, 350.org, WWF, Greenpeace and, keen to counter what he calls the ""misinformation machine"", funds environmental journalism at National Public Radio, the Center for Investigative Journalism, grist.org, Media Matters and the Yale Forum on Climate Change &amp; the Media. Until last year (when he decided investigative and environmental journalism was ""dying out"" due to cutbacks), he funded the world's most lucrative journalism award, the annual $80,000 Grantham prize for environmental reporting. In the past few months, however, there has been a conspicuous gear-shift in his activities. In addition to being more outspoken, he intends to support new research initiatives, particularly into ""avant garde, sustainable"" farming techniques. He talks of a ""hybrid"" form of farming that takes the best of organic farming and the best from ""Big Ag"". He doesn't rule out ""compromises"" such as genetic modification, which some environmentalists will find hard to swallow. Having said that, his interest isn't entirely selfless. ""Fifteen years ago, we started a forestry division [at GMO] because I had fallen in love with land and trees, and because I realised it was a mispriced asset class. We have done extremely well in that sector, outperforming the benchmark for 15 years."" Many deep-greens – who claim the root cause for our environmental woes is the slavish quest for economic growth – will recoil at the thought of a hard-boiled capitalist such as Grantham underpinning so much of the environmental movement. He is unconcerned. ""Capitalism does millions of things better than the alternatives. It balances supply and demand in an elegant way that central planning has never come close to. However, it is totally ill-equipped to deal with a small handful of issues. Unfortunately, they are the issues that are absolutely central to our long-term wellbeing and even survival."" More awkwardly, he insists his substantial investments in oil and gas don't contradict his green views. ""We need oil. If we took oil away tomorrow, civilisation ends. We can burn all the cheap, high-quality oil and gas, but if we mean to burn all the coal and any appreciable percentage of the tar sands, or even third-derivative, energy-intensive oil and gas, with 'fracking' for shale gas on the boundary, then we're cooked, we're done for."" He does think there's some cause for hope. For example, ""the business mathematics of alternative energy are changing much faster [than many people] realise."" Looming carbon taxes (""hopefully, in the not-too-distant future""), coupled with the increasing affordability of alternative energy, will mean that coal and oil from tar sands run the ""very substantial risk of being stranded assets"". There there's the ""amazing"" fall in fertility rates across the world (""the absolute minimum hope of survival is a gracefully declining population""). But ""China is my secret weapon,"" he says enthusiastically. His eyes widen with excitement, and he talks quicker and quicker. ""The Chinese cavalry riding to the rescue. I have very high hopes for China because they have embedded high scientific capabilities in their leadership class. They know this is serious. And they are acting much faster now than we are. They have it within their capabilities to come back in 30 years with the guarantee of complete energy independence – all alternative and sustainable for ever. They have an embarrassment of capital. We have an embarrassment of debt. So they can set a stunning pace, which they are doing. And they could crank it up. To hell with their five-year plans, they should move up to 25-year plans. They would have such low-cost energy at the end of it they'd be the terror of the capitalist system. Low energy and low labour, that's the ball game."" But he argues that there is no reason why the west can't compete. ""Anyone who says government can't do this, or can't do that, I say a pox on you; have a look at the Manhattan Project. They did remarkable things. They stuck the brightest minds out in the desert. They were herding cats with great egos, but it worked. If we did that on alternative energy, we'd be home free."" • Read the transcript of the Grantham interview",,0.1028126092516336

Now he's told the world – and his fellow activists – that he was wrong. So why did he change his mind? And does he have any friends left?,2713,"What was that line in Lord of the Flies? When Roger decides to kill Piggy? He makes that irreversible transgression with something like ""a sense of delirious abandonment"". Mark Lynas couldn't quite remember, but that's exactly how he felt as he walked on to the stage, in the mid-morning of 3 January, to make his dramatic speech. The night before he'd paced among the farmers and agriculture experts who would be his audience, thinking: ""These people have no idea what I'm going to say."" They were probably expecting to be bored and annoyed by the appearance of this raving eco-warrior. They didn't know that he'd taken the decision to stand in front of the people who were once his enemy – and confess. Back in the mid-90s he'd belonged to a ""radical cell"" of the anarchist, anti-capitalist environmental movement. He was influential – a co-founder of the magazine Corporate Watch who'd written the first article about the evils of Genetically Modified Organisms [GMOs] and Monsanto, the multinational biotech company whose work with GMOs was to become notorious. He was a law breaker. He'd pile into vans with gangs of up to 30 people and spend nights slashing GM crops with machetes. He was angry. He believed that the kind of people who'd attend the Oxford Farming Conference were ruining the world with greed. And now he was preparing to stand under spotlights and bow his head before them. He'd been nervous about it for days. He was scared that by the time his speech was over he wouldn't have any friends left at all. Once the crowd's mannered applause had died down, he began. ""My lords, ladies and gentlemen. I want to start with some apologies, which I believe are most appropriate to this audience. For the record, here and upfront, I apologise for having spent several years ripping up GM crops. I'm also sorry that I helped to start the anti-GM movement back in the mid-1990s and that I thereby assisted in demonising an important technological option which can be used to benefit the environment. As an environmentalist, and someone who believes that everyone in this world has a right to a healthy and nutritious diet of their choosing, I could not have chosen a more counter-productive path. I now regret it completely."" Fifty minutes later, the audience reacted with what he describes as ""shocked applause"". His website, on which he'd posted the text of his speech, crashed, unable to cope with the demand. He watched, on Twitter, as reaction spread around the world: Portugal, Spain, Chile, Argentina… Millions, he thinks, have now seen it. ""It was a complete demolition, not just of anti-GMO but of the whole organic thing,"" he says. ""For a lot of people, it was an 'Oh fuck' moment. They realised they'd been lied to, at a very profound level, by the very people they'd trusted."" And what of his worst fear, that he wouldn't have any friends left at all? ""Well,"" he smiles sadly. ""That's probably what happened."" Lynas, 39, lives in a modern terrace in a suburb of Oxford with his wife Maria, his puppy Scout and his children Tom, eight, and Rosa, six. He's handsome and fashionably presented, but in a strangely featureless way, like one of those members of Coldplay whose name nobody can remember. He gives me a cup of tea and leads me down towards his shed, with its sunken sofa, dusty curtains and shelves of sun-bleached books. He's worried about the interview and peppered me with questions beforehand: who was my editor? How many words would it be? Who was the photographer? Why did I want to write it? His anxiety is not surprising. Lynas's speech made the news internationally and, along with it, ""all the hate started coming through"". He found himself accused of being in the pay of Monsanto which, he says, ""shows that people think I have no integrity and look at me with complete contempt"". In the days when his anger came from the opposite direction, Lynas was a member of an organisation that was ""loosely called"" Earth First! It told a dramatic story about the world, in which the forces of industrialism were conspiring to bring about ""environmental apocalypse. Big corporations and capitalism in general were destroying the earth."" Theirs was a plucky struggle against the monstrous machines of profit. ""We were the protectors of the land and the inheritors of the natural forces,"" he says. ""We were the pixies."" Lynas first heard about the notion of genetically modifying crops in a Brighton squat in early 1996, at a meeting of about six activists that was lead by Jim Thomas, a campaigns director for Greenpeace. ""He really opened my eyes to the awfulness of what Monsanto seemed to be doing,"" he says. ""Something unnatural was being done to our food supply. Big corporations were using more chemicals so that they could take over the food chain."" It inspired him to write his Corporate Watch story that was ""the first on Monsanto, as far as I know"". By the time of Earth First!'s next gathering, GMOs had ""become the next big thing"". Lynas lead the early workshops that spread the message further. ""The people who consider themselves leaders in the anti-GM movement today, I trained them."" By 1997 his anger had turned to action, and the first ""decontamination actions"" to destroy experimental GM crops took place. ""We'd head out in a van with gardening tools, dark clothes, some cash and no ID."" Arriving at around 2am, between 20 and 30 of them would work until dawn, ""just going along the line"", destroying the plants. It wasn't always this straightforward. One night while he was slashing through maize with a machete somewhere in the east of England, Lynas saw flashing lights and heard the barking of dogs. He dropped into the dirt and held still. ""For some reason the police went right past me,"" he says. ""I got out of there. I found my way through some woods to the train station. A lot of the others were attacked by dogs and arrested. It was quite scary. In an odd way, I'm quite law abiding. You know, I wear glasses. I don't want to get hit in the face with a truncheon. I'm not really into confrontational situations at all."" Lynas played a crucial role at a sit-in, on 29 April 1998, at Monsanto's offices in High Wycombe. ""I cased the joint, printed the leaflets and hired the buses,"" he says. It was around this time, however, that Lynas began to experience the first mild cramps of rebellion. He'd begun to notice a widespread denial in the people around him. The more he recognised it, the more it felt like hypocrisy. ""Everyone thought of themselves as being tolerant and open-minded,"" he says. ""But if you said something critical about them, you'd be in quite serious trouble."" Trouble? ""I don't think anyone would've attacked you physically. But you'd go back to your worst days at school, just feeling like the child that everyone hated. I don't really thrive in that sort of bully-boy atmosphere."" The movement deluded itself about its non-hierarchical nature. It didn't have leaders or elections because, to them, democracy was a lie. ""But there were leaders – of which I definitely wasn't one – and everyone else was the sheep, the cannon fodder. The people who could rabble-rouse and were the most radical would rise to the top."" The irony of all this was that Earth First! became acutely hierarchical, and in the worst possible way, ""because the hierarchy is nontransparent"". A critical fracture between Lynas and his movement occurred after London's 2000 May Day riots, which he helped organise. A branch of McDonald's was attacked, a statue of Winston Churchill was given a grass Mohican, and the Cenotaph was graffitied. At a meeting of key individuals in a north London pub that followed ""everyone was saying: 'This is great',"" he remembers. ""'We've shown the corporate media!'"" Lynas, however, didn't agree. ""I thought it was a disaster. Everything we'd been trying to achieve was undermined by all the violence and window smashing. It just alienated people. I thought I'd be honest about it. Everyone looked at me in complete horror, shock and contempt."" How did that feel? ""Deeply hostile, and deeply limiting, actually. Tolerance and open-mindedness were qualities that people paid lip service to but were not really valued. That was one of the last meetings I went to."" Lynas had an unusual childhood, being born in Fiji and schooled for three years in Peru. His father was a scientist – a geologist who did mapping for the government – and yet was politically assertive enough to emigrate to Spain in the mid-1980s because of Margaret Thatcher. Lynas remembers Nicaraguan folk bands staying as house guests. Today, his parents live in North Wales. ""They have a little organic farm. Post-organic, really. My dad's with me in arguing the need for biological solutions, like GM, to reduce chemical use."" Lynas's metamorphosis gathered real pace when he started work on his 2004 book High Tide. It concerned the consequences of manmade climate change and involved him touring the continents seeking out its effects. This was a cause he was happy to be swept into: climate change made a perfect subplot for his grand narrative about the world of evil capitalism ruining nature. But this new episode introduced a curious character – a nerdy stranger who would go on to corrupt the plot of his life entirely. ""I didn't want my book to be just a series of anecdotes,"" he explains, ""so I began researching the science. And I fell in love with it. I realised that science offers a window into truth that nothing else can."" His embrace of evidence-based knowledge caused a problem. Many of his beliefs about GMOs were predicated on an extravagant dismissal of the scientific consensus. ""The whole GM thing had been about criticising scientists, saying they were corrupt, corporate shills,"" he says. ""And we definitely believed all those things. But I realised everything we were doing was deeply reductionist, basically saying: 'Scientists should shut down their labs and go and work in Tesco.' It was a kind of counter-enlightenment. People against a process."" Lynas lived the next few years in a state of weird, gigantic dissonance. A 2005 column for the New Statesman, which expressed doubt about traditional anti-nuclear arguments, prompted activists that he knew to ""write in, saying I'd ruined their lives"". His next book, Six Degrees: Our Future in a Hotter Planet, won 2008's prestigious Royal Society prize for science writing. And yet he was still existing between narratives in a way that, inevitably, became excruciating. The last piece of ""GM crap"" he wrote was for the Guardian, the year of his award. ""I knew at the time I didn't believe it,"" he says. ""I wrote it in an internet café. I thought: 'God, I really need to have some sources for these things.' Then I thought: 'Fuck it.' I'd just had this stamp of approval from the scientific community. And then I'm writing this completely unscientific and hopelessly unintellectual thing. How embarrassing can you get?"" In November 2010 he appeared on a Channel 4 documentary, What the Green Movement Got Wrong, and a live debate that followed. In the shows he defended GMOs and nuclear power. Afterwards, he says, a member of Greenpeace ""was that close to me, shouting in my face. I literally left the studio with a bag over my head."" Close friends felt betrayed. ""George Monbiot sent me a really devastating email."" He also fell out with the person who'd been best man at his wedding. ""We'd been friends for 10 years. We still have no relationship."" Lynas also experienced a more subtle realignment in his worldview. He'd been used to seeing the Green movement as the brave, scrappy underdogs. But the more he looked, the more little David began to resemble Goliath. ""Just take the numbers,"" he says. ""Greenpeace, the whole international group, is a $150m outfit [in fact, figures provided by Greenpeace show global income in 2011 as $313.4m]. Bigger than the World Trade Organisation, and much more influential in terms of determining how people think."" For Lynas, the modern Green movement is one of undeniable force. It's changed the world ""sometimes for the better"", but not always. ""The anti-nuclear movement is partly responsible for global warming,"" he says. ""Everywhere, pretty much, where a nuclear plant was cancelled, a coal plant was built instead, and that's because of the anti-nuclear movement. The environmental movement has been very successful in regulating GM out of existence in some parts of the world."" Lynas has been very critical of Greenpeace's policy towards a GM crop that's become totemic among campaigners. Golden rice is a crop that's been modified, by the insertion of the genes for the chemical beta-carotene, in an attempt to make it provide more vitamin A. ""Vitamin-A deficiency is one of the leading causes of death in southeast Asia,"" says Lynas. ""It's led to blindness and the death of about a quarter of a million people a year."" Yet campaigners, including Greenpeace, lobbied against it. Greenpeace insists golden rice is a ""waste of money"" and an ""ineffective tool… [that] is also environmentally irresponsible, poses risks to human health and compromises food security"". For Lynas, its stance is ""just superstition. There are tens of thousands of kids who are dead who wouldn't be dead otherwise. I don't see how you could put this any other way. Imagine if Monsanto had been culpable in the deaths of tens of thousands of children! It would be all over the Guardian."" (Lynas later made the partial concession that ""there have been technical hold-ups in the golden rice project, and you can't solely blame Greenpeace for the overregulation that is applied to GMOs"".) Since his Oxford Farming Conference speech, some have launched attacks on Lynas's interpretation of the science. But the rebellion against his rebellion has also been personal. Some former associates have questioned his claim to have been an influential figure. Jim Thomas, the former Greenpeace activist who first told Lynas about GMOs and lived with him for a few months, says: ""Lynas was a player, but not a very important player, and for a very short period of time. Maybe in his mind he was important, but I don't think anybody else saw him that way."" Ultimately, says Thomas, ""I feel saddened by the whole thing. He's built a very successful career on the back of portraying people who were his friends as unthinking."" Lynas counters that he's unable to defend himself from charges he's exaggerated his role due the illegality of the acts he and his associates were complicit in. ""People don't want their names mentioned,"" he says. But the attacks hurt. ""I've been complaining to my wife, but she said: 'Don't feel sorry for yourself. You've insulted people at the deepest level of their values. You've done something completely wounding to their very sense of self.' This was a life's work for people I was close to, and as far as they're concerned I've tried to destroy it."" As for Lynas's life's mission, the change has been everything and nothing. He might not be battling against corporations any more, but he still feels ""as if I'm changing the world for the better in my own small way"". Nevertheless, he speaks of the betrayal and subsequent loss of his friends as a tragedy – ""but tragic in the Shakespearean sense that you could see it coming"". Indeed, how much of his metamorphosis was inevitable? Can his mutiny really constitute a moral treachery when so much of it seemed to happen to him? He was, after all, born into a family of independent spirit, to a scientist father, who was also a political radical who deified the environment. Emotional rebellion became empirical rebellion, when a book project forced him from the ""echo chamber"" of Earth First!. And then, what should he do? Try to live with it all, hounded by the dissonance of his contradictions? Or speak up and brave whatever damage might be caused? His opponents, who mutter about his ""successful career"", despite his modest circumstances, deny the complexity of human motivation. Nobody is pure. But few do as he has done, and have the courage to doubt themselves with as much vigour as they've previously doubted others.",,0.04093659652760072
152,article,global-development/2013/feb/25/vandana-shiva-seeds-farmers,Global development,2013-02-25,Vandana Shiva: 'Seeds must be in the hands of farmers',https://gu.com/p/3dm4q,News,Vandana Shiva: 'Seeds must be in the hands of farmers',Biodiversity campaigner accuses corporate giants of trying to take over the world's seed supply through genetic engineering,877,"Vandana Shiva shows no sign of fatigue despite an overnight flight from Delhi and an hour's audience with Prince Charles before arriving at the Guardian, where she launches into her views on agriculture, food, biodiversity and ""seed freedom"". The Indian founder of Navdanya, which campaigns for biodiversity and against corporate control of food and seeds, says Africa is the battleground for two very different approaches to agriculture. One is the agroecological approach, based on the use of traditional seeds, diverse crops, trees and livestock, with smallholder farmers and the right to food at the core. The other is an industrial system based on monoculture, the use of fertilisers and genetically modified organisms (GMOs), where companies such as Monsanto, Dupont, Syngenta, BASF and Dow are dominant. No guesses as to where she stands, as she accuses these corporate giants of wanting to take over the world's seed supply through genetic engineering and patents by writing the World Trade Organisation's intellectual property rights treaty. She quotes a Monsanto representative as saying: ""In writing this treaty, we were the patient, the diagnostician, the physician – all in one."" Shiva is no fan of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation either, which she accuses of pushing a vision of agriculture based on GMOs and the use of fertilisers. The foundation, which supports the Guardian's Global development site, is one of the biggest players in agriculture. The US will spend around $1bn this year on averting global hunger – but that includes supporting big farms – and, in 2009, the UK Department for International Development (DfID) spent around £20m. In the past few years, the Gates Foundation has invested more than $2bn in trying to help smallholder farmers in Africa and Asia out of poverty. In Africa, the foundation funds several research organisations testing GM, and also Agra, the Nairobi-based Alliance for a Green Revolution, which aims to double the income of 20 million small-scale farmers and halve food insecurity in 20 countries by 2020. Although GM crops are allowed to be grown in only three countries, this is likely to change in the next five years. Sam Dryden, head of agriculture at the foundation, told the Guardian in an interview last year that it lobbies countries to accept GM technology but that he is keen to see more investment in traditional breeding and staple crops such as sorghum, millet and cassava that have been largely ignored by big seed companies. However, Shiva considers Agra to be making an assault on Africa's seed sovereignty. ""Agra by itself would have been insignificant. But because of Gates's ability to leverage funding, Agra can have a big impact,"" says Shiva, adding that Agra ambassador Kofi Annan is trying to win funding from the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation. On its website, Agra insists it is not just an extension of big international philanthropies like the Gates Foundation, but an independent organisation with its own board and governance structure. ""Our funding comes from a large number of international donors, but our base, approach and leadership are uniquely African,"" says Agra. Shiva's fundamental argument against GMOs is that they represent a ""petri dish"" view that fails to take into account the complexity of the real world. ""The idea that you can have everything in one gene is too crude to handle a complex living system,"" she argues. ""You can't run away from systems thinking. GMOs represent an attempt to find an escape route, to think of one gene and then to move it."" She also rejects the notion that it is possible to isolate a gene to develop a salt or drought resistant variety crop. ""Say there are 1,500 climate resistant genes and we go to the gene bank to map drought resistant genes and make a bet on 100 varieties that have the highest potential. We still don't really know what's contributing to drought resistance. It is not a reliable way of finding drought resistant varieties. Diversity has to be the approach, there is no magic bullet. Diversity has to be our partner in adaptation and resilience."" Besides, Shiva says, farmers in India have already developed drought tolerant varieties such as Nalibakuri, Kalakaya and Inkiri, and salt tolerant varieties such as Bhundi and Kalambank. In her campaign for seed diversity, Shiva is pushing for groups across the world to preserve seeds – and her visit to the UK in February was part of that drive. She describes her movement as ""open source seed"", a deliberate echo of open source software. For Shiva, GMOs represent 20 years of failed promises and worse, leading to the emergence of super weeds and super pests. In India, Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) cotton, sold under the name ""Bollguard"", was supposed to control the bollworm pest, but according to a Seed Freedom report last year, The GMO Emperor Has No Clothes (pdf), the bollworm has become resistant to Bt cotton. On top of that, new pests have emerged and farmers are using more pesticides. Climate change, argues Shiva, makes biodiversity even more crucial. ""In a period of climate change, the world needs a biodiverse system,"" she says. ""The system of seeds based on monoculture is wrong and inappropriate. The biodiverse system has produced more food, and biodiversity means that seeds must be in the hands of farmers.""",,0.03347368777056276
153,article,global-development/2013/feb/15/scientists-mexico-agriculture-revolution-food-security,Global development,2013-02-15,Scientists in Mexico herald agriculture revolution in food security push,https://gu.com/p/3dzhv,News,Scientists in Mexico herald agriculture revolution in food security push,An agriculture centre part funded by Carlos Slim and Bill Gates hopes to 'provide food security for generations' but the centre's GM research is not welcomed by everyone,774,"Scientists at a major international research centre based in Mexico say recent donations from billionaire philanthropists have taken them significantly closer to providing poor farmers with more productive, nutritional and resistant varieties of wheat and maize at a critical time. ""We believe that we are witnessing the start of a genuine new agricultural revolution that will provide food security for generations to come,"" Thomas Lumpkin, director of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre, said at this week's inauguration of facilities funded by a $25m (£16.1m) donation from Mexican telecommunications magnate Carlos Slim, the world's richest person. Lumpkin said the new laboratories and greenhouses would double research capacity at the centre, known by its Spanish abbreviation CIMMYT. The centre, famous for launching the ""Green Revolution"" in Mexico and south Asia in the 1960s, is located just outside Mexico City. Lumpkin and Slim were joined at the ceremony by Bill Gates, No 2 on the global rich list, whose contributions reputedly saved the centre from going under a decade ago. All of them stressed that a perfect storm of rising demand for basic grains, dwindling resources, new pests and the additional pressures expected from climate change could have catastrophic impacts in many parts of the world if small-scale farmers are not given affordable access to new varieties that can better cope with these challenges. Interviewed after the event, Lumpkin said the biggest potential for doing this comes from applying technology developed in human genetic research to germ plasm. He said CIMMYT is at the vanguard of these efforts because of its massive gene banks storing 28,000 varieties of maize and 120,000 varieties of wheat. ""Before you were dealing with shadows and vague things off in the distance, but now we have a sharp focus and can see much more,"" Lumpkin said of the difference between the old methods of hybridisation and the new possibilities for precision picking and mixing of desired traits. CIMMYT plans to make the information from its research easily available and understandable to breeders around the world so that they can use it to develop their own varieties specifically designed to address local problems. More controversially, CIMMYT's revamped facilities are designed to increase the centre's capacity for transgenic research. While insisting that transgenics will remain a relatively minor part of the Mexico programme, probably reaching about 10% in the next five years, Lumpkin argues it could prove critical where manipulation of natural diversity proves insufficient. CIMMYT scientists say it is particularly important, for example, to find ways of increasing heat tolerance in wheat varieties used in south Asia, where demand is booming and temperatures are predicted to rise dramatically in the next decade. Lumpkin claims that when delivered by non-profit organisations such as CIMMYT, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can help tackle rural inequality by spreading technology that is currently largely limited to the developed world. CIMMYT is already working with experimental GMO maize crops in Kenya and several other African countries using ""tried and tested"" traits provided for free by multinational companies under special agreements. Lumpkin says companies such as Monsanto are willing to do this when the varieties produced are designed for markets that are not commercially significant. In Mexico, CIMMYT's GM research is limited to wheat, but the new facilities open the possibility of expanding this to much more controversial research with maize. Mexico is a centre of origin of the crop and the country is home to a vibrant anti-transgenic movement rooted in concerns about contamination of local varieties, deep distrust of official guarantees of safety, and suspicion of the motives of proponents of these technologies. Campaigners are trying to prevent the Mexican government authorising big commercial projects on GM maize, following a period of several years of experimental and pilot schemes they say have not been properly monitored. ""They talk about transgenics as the solution to world hunger and inequality but it is a false solution,"" said Greenpeace Mexico's spokesman on agriculture, Aleira Lara. ""Even if it is altruistic there are risks. What we need is for the state to attend to the real problems. We need more state budgets to do things such as invest in improving irrigation systems."" CIMMYT scientists, and their billionaire backers, are careful to express their respect for Mexican sensitivities about maize, but are also committed to the idea that the potential benefits out way the risks. At the ceremony in Mexico on Wednesday, Gates said there were ""legitimate issues, but solvable issues"" around GM and lauded CIMMYT's role trying to sidestep concerns about monopolisation of the technology by the multinationals. His foundation dedicates about 8% of its agricultural budget to GM-associated projects.",,0.11553822194066093

Is clothing made in the UK inherently more ethical?,445,"I agree, you can't move for brands flirting with Union Jack labels and British heritage. The ethicalfashionforum.com explains that: ""Made in Britain labelling is being associated with high sustainability standards by fashion designers and brands in the UK."" This is merited when it comes to brands which have short supply chains and where the designer has a direct relationship with that chain. Some of the best examples are Henrietta Ludgate (quirky design), Sirplus (menswear from cabbage – that's industry speak for off-cuts), Tanner Bates (oak-bark-dyed leather from Devon) and Lily Cole's the North Circular (hand knits by grannies). But these are tiny brands with big prices. The real excitement comes now that high-street names are talking about ""onshoring"" – manufacturing in the UK after decades of aggressively offshoring production to factories with cheap labour in China, Bangladesh, Cambodia and elsewhere. River Island, for instance, has increased its British-made offering by 50%. There is likely to be a small ethical dividend to British manufacturing. Labourbehindthelabel.org says: ""Consumers know that buying UK-made clothes probably means the people who made them were treated more fairly than in factories overseas."" But in reality fashion production returning to Britain has been vastly over-hyped. Figures from big retailers sound impressive, but George at Asda admits that despite an increase of 50%, British-made clothing only represents 1-2% of clothes and accessories sold. Meanwhile, beware hollow heritage claims. I've seen pieces incorporating a tiny percentage of British-made fabric (a tweed trim for example) or partly assembled in the UK, pleading British identity. Look for the brands that mean it. When you buy from privatewhitevc.com, you are supporting a £2m investment into the Manchester factory where these clothes are made. Manufacturing capacity has been increased and the next generation of skilled workers is being trained – the stuff that British manufacturing needs to prove it can cut it sustainably. Green crush of the week The Bay (in cinemas from 1 March) is the stuff of ecological nightmares. Director Barry Levinson (who won an Oscar for Rain Man) originally wanted to make a factual film about Maryland's Chesapeake Bay's marine 'dead zone' caused by pollution. Then he discovered a previous documentary had been ignored, so decided to fictionalise and up the horror (but 80% is still based on fact). Beware: if you watch this film, seafood and drinking water will lose their appeal. Greenspeak: Open pollinators Non-hybrid and non-GMO plant seeds that have been pollinated naturally.

Also, check your Utopian food labelling as a corporate exec reveals dirty GMO meddling in corn proteins",1112,"SPOILER ALERT: This blog is for people watching Utopia on Channel 4. Don't read on if you haven't seen episode four. Catch up with Richard Vine's episode three blog ""We're scary – that's what we've become. We're just like them now."" We open with Alice, screaming inconsolably for her mother, shot at point-blank range by Arby last week. She spends her time hiding out in the abandoned manor house in shock, worrying about getting her essay in on time – the confused look on Grant's face about her dedication to homework was priceless. But it's not just there for comedy value. She's been reading Crime and Punishment – and it's clear that Raskolnikov's philosophy has sunk in. ""He deduces that killing a human is right in pursuit of a higher cause,"" she tells Grant. By the end she's Utopia's answer to Hit Girl, shooting the man she holds ultimately responsible for killing her mum with a sawn-off shotgun. ""I read it. There's a boy. They torture him."" So Arby is really ""RB"", aka ""Raisin Boy"". Not the scariest of assassin code-names, it has to be said. But there's more than a little pathos coming through in Arby's backstory as he engages in a gunpoint version of Who Do You Think You Are? with Letts and his assistant. ""That's what they called you when they forgot who you were,"" Letts reveals. Later, it's Arby on the other end of a gun – Jessica's. But was that a smile on his face? Has he remembered more than he's letting on? It's hard not to suspect a deeper connection between these two. Siblings? Clones? Graduates of the same Russian assassin breeding programme? Are Alice and Grant being primed to be the next generation of Utopia's killers? While Becky and Ian are getting cosy over some cans of Fanta, Wilson's been busy looking through Grant's drawings of the manuscript. His theory? Carvel's plan involves introducing a contaminant into the food chain – such as BSE. Becky has another take: ""What if it's not the disease that's selective? What if it's the cure?"" They adapt ""some fucking weapons-grade flu virus that can be hidden in food"", and then make a vaccine that's only effective on certain races. There's a logo in the drawings, a crescent in a circle, that's also the logo for Pergus Holdings. It's a massive conglomerate making fizzy drinks, pet food – and the packet of Bayners Crisps that Ian's has just served up to Becky for their romantic dinner. After a quick bit of smart phone research (Wilson's malware skills coming in handy again) they find the name of the Pergus CEO: Lane Monroe. His name begins with ""L"" - is he Mr Rabbit? ""I'm sick of waiting for people to save us"" The short answer is: no, Monroe's not Mr Rabbit. But he does reveal (before Alice kills him during their botched commando raid) that Pergus have dispersed the ""GCH1 protein"", via a corn modification in their products. It's broken down, used in animal feeds, which are then passed on to us ""harmlessly"" via some modified amino acids we absorb (got that?). But why? Now they've kidnapped Letts, perhaps he'll reveal all next week. I doubt it somehow. Could he be Mr Rabbit? He's supposed to be in charge, but the more time with him we spend, the more if feels like it's James Fox's assistant who's running things – kind of like the paranoid, global, chemical conspiracy version of Yes, Minister. ""Is that Jen?"" After another brush with triumph – getting the test results away from shady Professor Donaldson – it's yet another downturn for Dugdale. How much more can he take? Minister Geoff makes good on his blackmail threat and hits Dugdale where it really hurts: his wife. The sinking look on his face as he walks in to find Jen watching the compromising video of him and Anya said it all. Unlike the doctored CCTV footage of Grant at the school massacre, The Network didn't have to fake Dugdale's indiscretions, just film them. This seems to be another of their specialties. Donaldson's indignation at being branded ""Professor Pervert"" in the press after he tried to expose Sars in Hong Kong (nothing more than a string of ""unconnected respiratory infections"" in Utopia's universe) was somewhat undercut by his admission: ""I do like cocaine and prostitutes."" Notes, quotes and queries • Some more interesting spots in the comments last week – keep them coming. Thanks to @DsGo @AntonBlank, @degrus who all suggested that what looked (to me) like the letters ""BONU"" written on the wall in Grant's school was much more likely to be ""BCNU"" (""Be seeing you"") – could this be a little nod to The Prisoner? On the other hand, @AnthonyMarx found a company (BioNeutral Group Inc.) who might fit the bill if it is BONU. • Meanwhile eagle-eyed @IanBradley pointed out that: ""There's a creepy easter egg if you dial the police hotline number in the background when Grant's mother is making the appeal"" - another one of those details that's making Utopia so entertaining. • Is ""psycho pirate"" going to be one of the TV looks of 2013? The Walking Dead is back soon, with David Morrissey returning as ""The Governor"" - also in an ""ocularly challenged"" position. One more eye patch and it's a trend. • ""Grant – about my essay. It's late, we need to get it in."" Alice's dedication to Dostoevsky is admirable. • ""She's attractive. In a skinny bitch, evil murderess kind of way."" Becky sizes up the competition. • Crime and Punishment, Russian flu, and Arby's real name – a strong Russian element running through this week. Did anyone catch Arby's name? Pietrey? Piotr? • ""I'm a spy, it's sort of the point of what I do."" Milner cuts through Ian's worries with a decisive ""never mind the specifics, let's get on with the story"" logic. • Anyone else think that the look on Jessica's face when Grant hugged her – straight up to the sky – was similar to her ""murder face"" when she killed The Tramp? And why did she kiss Ian? To try it out? Does she keep wandering off and keeping an eye on things from a distance just because she can't handle small talk? • There were some noteworthy moments with Becky looking at her supply of meds – reminiscent of the ""chems"" the spies take in The Bourne Legacy perhaps? Did the way she got upset after spilling the Fanta at the end of Ian's romantic ""madness, murder and mayhem"" speech suggest that the degenerative effects of Deels might be kicking in? • ""What – like a break up?""

156,article,science/2013/jan/05/the-future-of-food,Science,2013-01-05,Inside the meat lab: the future of food,https://gu.com/p/3cz42,News,Inside the meat lab: the future of food,"With billions of mouths to feed, we can't go on producing food in the traditional way. Scientists are coming up with novel ways to cater for future generations. In-vitro burger, anyone?",1780,"The future feast is laid out around a cool white room at Eindhoven's University of Technology . There is a steak tartare of in-vitro beef fibre, wittily knitted into the word ""meat"". There are ""fruit-meat"" amuse-gueules. The green- and pink-striped sushi comes from a genetically modified vegetarian fish called the biccio that, usefully, has green- and pink-striped flesh. To wash this down, there's a programmable red wine: with a microwave pulse you can turn it into anything from Montepulciano to a Syrah. For the kids, there are sweet fried crickets, programmable colas and ""magic meatballs"". These are made from animal-friendly artificial meat grown from stem cells: packed with Omega 3 and vitamins, they ""crackle in your mouth"". Yum. None of this is quite ready to dish up. The meatballs at the Eindhoven future food show are made from Plasticine; the knitted steak, appropriately, from pinky-red wool. But the ideas aren't fantasy. Koert van Mensvoort, assistant professor at the university, calls them ""nearly possible"". Van Mensvoort – who is also the brains behind nextnature.net, a must-see website for technological neophiliacs – put his industrial design undergraduates together with bio-tech engineers, marketing specialists and a moral philosopher, tasking them to come up with samples of food that is, technologically, already on our doorstep. The truth, though, is that artificial steak is still a way off. Pizza toppings are closer. The star of the Dutch research into in-vitro meat, Dr Mark Post, promised that the first artificial hamburger, made from 10bn lab-grown cells, would be ready for ""flame-grilling by Heston Blumenthal"" by the end of 2012. At the time of writing it is still on the back burner. Post (who previously produced valves for heart surgery) and other Dutch scientists are currently working over the problem of how to turn the ""meat"" from pieces of jelly into something acceptably structured: an old-fashioned muscle. Electric shocks may be the answer. This quest is key to the future of food. It's not what can be done but what we will accept. Some scientists warn that trying to copy the meats humans are used to is futile – another symptom of our ignorant and unsustainable nostalgia about food. ""It's simplistic to say 'natural is good', to reject globalisation and hark back to a mythical past when food was still 'true and honest',"" says the Dutch intellectual Louise Fresco, a former head of food- innovation research and an advisor to the UN. ""It's the default thing to do, to try and replicate what you know,"" warns van Mensvoort. ""It's not how you innovate. We started with horseless carriages, but in the end what we got was cars. 'Natural' is the biggest marketing scam, and the most successful, of all."" The technological problems of producing the new hi-tech foods are nothing compared to the trouble the industry is having with the consumers – the ""yuck factor"", as the food technology scientists across the world like to put it. Shoppers' squeamishness has turned the food corporations, from whom the real money for R&amp;D will have to come, very wary, and super-secretive about their work on GM in America. There's energy behind these projects because of the certainty that 9 billion human beings cannot possibly go on eating food, especially meat, produced in the traditional way. The planet can't take it. Dutch food companies need to cater to a population that eats more pork than any other in Europe, but they do not publicly fund Koert van Mensvoort's work at Eindhoven, or any of the artificial-meat research. That's done by the Dutch government. Van Mensvoort is contemptuous of the food corporations' nervousness, especially when so much is at stake, pointing out that ""if the industry sees a word like 'pharmaceutical sushi' they say, 'You can't put our name near that!' They're afraid."" I have first-hand experience of this: at a scientific conference on food and nano-technology (engineering at sub-molecular level) an executive from Europe's biggest food company begged me not to print the fact that he was there. It's all Monsanto's fault. ""It was a historic mistake that GMO started with herbicides, and that the US government gave the corporations the freedom to introduce them,"" says Professor Fresco, who wants to feed not just the rich, but the hungry all across a future world of 9 billion people. Monsanto, the Dr Frankenstein of our time, certainly generated appalling publicity around its callous and careless marketing of GM pesticides in the United States and in India. The public's subsequent collapse of faith in bio-tech science, says Fresco, has not just put the brakes on new foods for the rich world. It's also damaging the fight to end hunger. Hundreds of millions of Africans who depend on an unreliable staple, such as cassava, are deprived of the technology that could make it disease- and pest-resistant. GM rice could raise productivity by 40%. ""African scientists say, 'Don't you dare bar us from this technology,'"" says Fresco. There are risks, she agrees, but she believes we're better able to monitor them than ever before. Though the scientists in Holland avoid the term GM, the quiet consensus is that the technology is coming, the world needs it and that Europe needs to get real about it or be left behind. Could ethical concerns ultimately drive public acceptance of the new food technology? Cor van der Weele, Professor of Humanistic Philosophy at Wageningen University, is convinced that's the case, with artificial meat at least. ""People will see the moral benefits of cultured meats. Taking stem cells from a pig rather than killing millions of pigs in factories is already a more attractive idea to consumers."" She quotes studies of the viability of growing meat in sunlight-fuelled ""bio-reactors"" placed in desert areas: the reduction in resources is staggering. ""It would require 1% of the land and just 2% of the water that traditional meat production does. And it would involve a 90% reduction in greenhouse gases,"" she says. Eating real meat in 2035 could be as morally questionable as eating foie gras – and about as expensive. As Dr Mark Post says: ""A meat-eater with a bicycle is much more environmentally unfriendly than a vegetarian with a Hummer."" All we know for sure is that future meals are going to be more expensive, and won't come in a pill. That job is technically impossible: even the Pentagon's battlefield R&amp;D department has given up trying to cram 2,000 calories into one capsule (it would weigh about half a pound). Besides, we like eating. And though the food industry is brilliant at selling us things we don't need, the customer is still king. Our desires in food are laden with paradox. We love novelty, but are transfixed by nostalgia and tradition. We want to pay less while getting ever better quality. We want natural and healthy, though the two are not necessarily the same. We want to eat better than previous generations, but we revere what those generations ate. Nostalgia, neophilia, hypochondria and snobbery drive the hunter-gatherer today, all sauced with deep scepticism about science, supermarkets and the dark machinations of the ""food-industrial complex"". None of that seems likely to change over the next 25 years. But what will is the supply of food – more radically than at any time during the 20th century. Climate change and the end of the era of cheap fossil fuels for transport and fertiliser are altering the food system. The world's three most important food crops – rice, wheat and maize – are largely grown in the countries most at risk from rising temperatures, and the predictions are stark. Maize, for a start, can't be grown above 30C. All food futurologists agree we can't go on eating the way we have. But though the organic lobby is convinced that back to basics could solve the world's problems, no serious scientist believes traditional farming alone will work. And so we will have to accept the new and ""unnatural"" if we want to stay fed. The public already accepts many things as natural that are not – from the bacteria-generated slime that gives bulk to low-fat mayonnaise to the chemicals that taste more real than the real thing (have a look at the label next time you buy ""truffle oil""). Author Josh Schonwald has found US bio-tech researchers are already far ahead with the nutrition of the future. As he reveals in his book, The Food of Tomorrow, the labs at the University of California-Davis are gene-splicing to create ""grapes spiked with jellyfish, tomatoes spiked with carp…"" and lettuce that will last on the shelf for weeks. There may already be pigs genetically engineered to grow up to five times faster. Notoriously – it was the subject of a Greenpeace campaign – there is a tomato made to last longer by using Arctic flounder genes, while in Israel a lemon basil plant crossed with a tomato has tested well with consumers. In Schonwald's view, all that the industry awaits is a relaxation of government regulation that will make development of these foods financially feasible. In the course of writing his book, Schonwald was converted. He began as a technosceptic: now he reckons that categorical rejection of GM is ""reckless, dangerous and inhumane"". It's the promise of adapting crops to get essential vitamins to millions of the poorest children that sold GM to him. But, historically, hi-tech seems to let down the poor. Chemical fertiliser and pesticide has created dependency and pollution. Medical breakthroughs are for the rich world: drug companies spend more researching erectile dysfunction than they do malaria. But breeding and mutating food species, whether in a lab or on the farm, is the only convincing plan anyone has for feeding the whole world. Something has to give in our present food culture. It doesn't seem possible that food can ever be as cheap again as it was circa the year 2000. In Western Europe we now spend between 10% and 15% of household income on food – 60 years ago it was 60%. Tim Lang, Professor of Food Policy at London's City University, says cheap food has been unrealistic, because at the moment we don't actually pay its real price: ""We've externalised the costs on to the environment, far-off places and cheap labour throughout food chains."" Population growth alone is going to push up the price of grain; the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation reckons the planet will need to produce 40% more by 2050, while climate change is already affecting the great bread-baskets of the world. Lang has told the UK government that the oil-dependent food culture is over and that trading bio-diversity for food justice ""will lead to Armageddon"". When the future food arrives, most of us won't have any choice about what we eat.",,0.07316510266820826

But will the spread of GM benefit hungry consumers, or global agribusiness?",865,"On the sidelines of the US presidential election, battle lines were drawn on a Californian ballot that has potential implications for broader debates about the challenges of global food security. Proposition 37, which was narrowly defeated (52.8% of voters opposed the measure), would have required mandatory labelling for all genetically engineered food sold to consumers in California. Supporters argued that people had the right to know exactly what they were buying, and the requirement for foods to be appropriately labelled was simply a way of allowing them to make a more informed choice. Opponents claimed the measure would ultimately increase household grocery costs by generating additional bureaucracy and potentially tying up farmers and agricultural businesses in expensive litigation. Behind the scenes were fierce arguments about the use of genetic technology in the food industry, concerns about biosafety, and a demonstration of the filibustering power of US agribusiness. The Yes campaign accused large agrochemical companies of spending millions of dollars on opposition to Proposition 37 in the last few weeks before the election, and of spreading misinformation. There seems little doubt that achieving food security will involve biotechnology. What is more contentious is the way in which these technologies are rolled out and, more to the point, who stands to benefit. The development, deployment and control of agricultural biotechnology is likely to result in winners and losers. There is no such thing as socially neutral or apolitical technology. There are, for example, considerable differences between publicly funded genetic research, which is made freely available to farmers and other producers, and patented and protected technologies that are distributed under the proprietary control of private companies. In reality, biotechnological development is likely to involve compromise between the need to provide adequate incentives for research and development within the private sector, including allowing patents and intellectual property to protect profitability, and the need for these technologies to be used on a sufficient scale to offer sustainable solutions to the challenge of feeding 7 billion people. Concerns about biosafety are equally important. For proponents of genetic technologies to dismiss these as the irrational fears of misinformed consumers is short-sighted, and potentially underestimates the power of consumer voice, especially in the digital age. It's also patronising, suggesting consumers should have choice on the shelves but not on the labels. National attitudes matter as well. The debate in Europe over GM foods is considerably more cautious than in North America, and European regulators are far more sensitive to public opinion. In India, one of the largest public consultation exercises associated with licensing new agricultural technologies led to a two-year moratorium on growing GM brinjal (aubergine) in 2010, despite a report by the country's six science academies concluding that the crop was safe for cultivation. What was interesting about the Indian consultation was that the decision to allow GM brinjal was opposed by a coalition of farmers, consumer groups and NGOs, reflecting, in many ways, the voices that were most articulate in the defeated Yes campaign in California. These groups were criticised by some scientists and (Indian as well as multinational) agribusinesses, some of whom questioned the decision of India's then environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, to undertake a public consultation over what was seen by them to be essentially a regulatory and scientific issue. As global food markets become more integrated, choices over the regulation of new technologies are unlikely to have isolated impacts, whether in California or India. Indeed, we have already witnessed the tragic consequences of US food aid being rejected by the Zambian government as the country faced famine in 2002. The Zambian government felt unable to accept American donations because most corn and soya grown in the US was genetically modified. The concerns were both about the safety and the longer-term consequences of strains of GM corn and soya entering Zambia's food system, and thereby affecting the country's future ability to export to more wary European markets. As we look ahead to a more globalised food production system, concerns over food labelling, the regulation and control of biotechnologies, and the right to make informed choices about consumption perhaps herald a broader debate that is going to profoundly shape our abilities to respond to the challenges of feeding the world during the 21st century. While some form of biotechnology is likely to be part of the solution, its proponents need to recognise that its deployment has political, social and economic consequences. These go beyond techno-centric debates about efficiency and effectiveness. Recognising the political economy of biotechnology use may well allow us to harness the promise of these developments in a manner that genuinely provides solutions for global food security that are socially acceptable, and better for human and environmental wellbeing. • Bhaskar Vira is senior lecturer in environment and development and David Nally is senior lecturer in human geography at the department of geography, University of Cambridge, and both are fellows of Fitzwilliam College.

With 95% of votes counted, the polls showed 47% voted in favour and 53% against. The contentious measure, proposition 37, would have required GM labels on food sold in supermarkets, and was seen as a testbed case for the US as a whole. Monsanto and other agribusiness and food companies such as PepsiCo and Nestle spent $45m on advertising and lobbying for the ""no"" campaign, compared with around $8m for the ""yes"" campaign, that was largely funded by organic food companies. Before the vote, the prop 37 supporter Andrew Kimbrell had said he hoped it would be the ""hammer we needed to break open the federal roadblock"". But those hopes have been dashed with 23,221 of 24,491 precincts in the state reporting votes. Grant Lundberg, CEO of Lundberg Family Farms, co-chair of the Yes on 37 group, told the San Franciso Chronicle: ""Whatever happens tonight, this is a win. Never before have millions of Californians come together to support giving consumers a choice about genetically engineered foods."" The yes campaign had attracted several celebrity supporters, such as Gwyneth Paltrow and rap star Pharrell Williams who tweeted on Tuesday night: ""vote yes on Prop 37 if you believe you have the right to know what's in your food."" In a statement, Kristin Lynch, Pacific region director of NGO Food &amp; Water, said: ""While support for genetically engineered (GE) food labels has never been stronger, the incessant drumbeat of misleading and outright false industry advertising was barely able to defeat this popular measure. While disappointed in the result, we believe that this movement to label GE foods is stronger than ever and we will continue to build a robust national grassroots campaign to push for mandatory labeling across the country."" Supporters had argued consumers have the ""right to know"" if GM products are in their food, but corporate opponents said the labels would lead to price rises. The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), which opposed the proposition, has said: ""These efforts [to label] are not driven by evidence that GM foods are actually dangerous. Indeed, the science is quite clear: crop improvement by the modern molecular techniques of biotechnology is safe."" Around 90% of US-grown corn and soybean is GM.",,0.08146258503401357

The measure, proposition 37, is one of the most contentious initiatives on California's election ballot on Tuesday. If it passes, it would require labels on GM food sold in supermarkets, but would not cover restaurants. It also has a number of gaping loopholes. For example, the law would not require labels on meat from animals that were fed GM corn. Even with those caveats, the agribusiness and food companies have outspent the yes side by about five to one trying to kill the bill. Monsanto alone has spent more than $8m. ""I think it's a David and Goliath story with the companies that manufacture or benefit from genetically engineered food being the Goliath,"" said David Newman, president of Maplight, which tracks the influence of money in politics. ""When you see this lopsided spending it indicates that the measure is popular with voters and opponents think they need to spend a lot to defeat it. There is a lot at stake here not just in California but how it will trend in the rest of the country."" California's ballot initiatives often take on huge importance. Often they are seen as laboratories for new ideas, that are adopted later in the rest of the country. The bill is mainly supported by organic food companies, although the actor Gwyneth Paltrow also contributed $15,000, according to campaigners. Supporters argue the consumers have a right to know if they are eating GM foods. Opponents – overwhelmingly corporations such as Monsanto, Dupont, Pepsico and Nestle – say the labels would be burdensome to retailers, and would force prices to rise. Others support the idea of labels in general but argue that this particular initiative is poorly written. A label requirement could have a sweeping effect on the American foods industry. About 90% of American-grown corn and soybean are GM. Other large crops, such as canola and sugar beet, also tend to be GM.",,0.1509379509379509
160,article,commentisfree/2012/oct/09/genetically-modifying-patenting-seeds,Opinion,2012-10-09,Genetically modifying and patenting seeds isn't the answer | Charles Eisenstein,https://gu.com/p/3bxm7,Opinion,Genetically modifying and patenting seeds isn't the answer,"Instead of patenting genetic discoveries and making them artificially scarce, we should draw on traditional farming practices",836,"The great historian Lewis Mumford once described a patent as ""a device that enables one man to claim special financial rewards for being the last link in the complicated social process that produced the invention"". He was pointing out that we do not produce inventions ex nihilo, but rather draw on the totality of the inventions and knowledge that came before us. It is no longer just the fruits of a centuries-long social process that are targets of patent claims. Through genetic engineering, corporations can now create and patent new life forms. Physicist Vandana Shiva, in a video launching the global Seed Freedom Campaign, calls this ownership of entire new species a form of slavery, and calls upon farmers and consumers to fight the privatisation of the genetic commons. Could it be that she is being naive? Facing the spectre of world hunger amid continued population growth, maybe we will have to let go of our sentimental attachment to traditional farmers saving seeds, and transition to high-tech agriculture so that we can improve yields per hectare. After all, we cannot clear much more cropland at the expense of forests and wetlands. And to finance the enormous long-term investment necessary to engineer high-yielding, drought-resistant, pest-resistant varieties, don't we need to enforce a strong system of patents? This position seems reasonable, but it is fraught with assumptions that collapse under close scrutiny. First and foremost is the notion that we need chemical pesticides, herbicides and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to feed the hungry. Surely each new innovation brings higher crop yields, right? Surely yields are higher when you kill the bugs than when you don't, higher when you use improved strains than when you don't? Not really. Holding all other variables constant, certainly a large wheat field will produce more if it is treated with chemical herbicides, pesticides and fertilisers. But organic agriculture, and especially permaculture and traditional peasant agriculture, don't hold variables constant at all. Each farming culture adapts over time to the unique characteristics of the local soil, biome and climate. Farmer and land co-evolve over generations. Numerous studies show that when organic agriculture is practised well, it can bring double or triple the yields of conventional techniques. With intensive intercropping on mixed permaculture farms, yields can be higher still. It is a myth that mechanised, chemical, GMO agriculture maximises yield per hectare. What it does maximise is productivity per unit of labour, which is a good thing if we uphold American-style economic development as a model for the rest of the world. Taking the essential parameters of large-scale mechanised agriculture as a given, those who argue that we need genetic engineering – and therefore GMO patenting – to feed the world's hungry are right. However, these parameters encode assumptions that we are beginning to recognise as diastrous. Western-style agriculture faces a mounting crisis that is insurmountable through the usual application of more control-based technology. Aquifer depletion, salinisation, soil erosion and soil compaction reveal our system as unsustainable. Meanwhile, each technological solution generates unanticipated new problems; for example, herbicide and pesticide resistance (superweeds and superbugs) mean that more technology is needed even to keep yields from declining. GMOs seem to generate unpredictable health dangers. And commodifying agricultural inputs like GM seeds and the pesticides and herbicides they are designed to accompany disrupts rural labour reciprocity, promotes indebtedness and creates dependence on volatile international commodity prices. This crisis calls us toward more ecological farming methods that draw from the world's ancient agricultural traditions. These traditions include not only agronomic knowledge, but also social structures that allow that knowledge to evolve and circulate. Today, instead we have an intellectual property system that encourages innovation, yes, but only a certain kind of innovation – the kind that leads to greater profits. What is the alternative? The ancient practice of seed saving and seed sharing, which allows plants, land, and culture to co-evolve organically, is being revived by organisations like the Seed Savers Exchange. The Seed Freedom movement seeks to preserve this practice, which comes under assault whenever new regulations are proposed to require registration of all seeds to protect the intellectual property rights of patent holders. Over the last two decades, innovative permaculture practices have spread like wildfire, and none of them are patented, made artificially scarce and then sold. Instead they are copied, shared and adapted to local conditions – much the same way that genes spread through species and life forms spread around the globe. In ecology, each species contributes to the wellbeing of all life and benefits from the wellbeing of all life. Now humanity is rejoining that circle. The next great agricultural transformation will not be an intensification of technologies of extraction and control; it will be an ecological agriculture that regenerates soil, aquifers and biodiversity. Traditional agricultural societies where farmers still save and share seeds are much closer to the ideal of ecological agriculture than the western model. Rather than imposing our technology on the rest of the world, perhaps it is us who can learn from them.",,0.16111445139222919
161,article,sustainable-business/vandana-shiva-corporate-monopoly-seeds,Guardian Sustainable Business,2012-10-08,Vandana Shiva: corporate monopoly of seeds must end,https://gu.com/p/3bx3d,,Vandana Shiva: corporate monopoly of seeds must end,"Sustainability pioneer Vandana Shiva speaks to Jo Confino about campaigning against seed slavery, corporations and patents",835,"Vandana Shiva, one of the Guardian's Top 100 most inspiring women, is currently leading a campaign to create a global citizens' response on the issue of seed freedom. In 1991, Shiva founded Navadanya, a movement which aims to protect nature and people's rights to knowledge, biodiversity, water and food. It does this by setting up community seed banks that generate livelihoods for local people and provide for basic needs. Shiva, a scientist, philosopher, feminist, author, environmentalist and activist, explains why the two week campaign on seed freedom against major corporations, which culminates on World Food Day later this month, is so important and the consequences of failure. Shiva calls for civil disobedience, quoting Gandhi who said that ""as long as the superstition that unjust laws must be obeyed exists, so will slavery exist"". Why do you refer to the term seed slavery? In another time, some people thought it was alright to own other people as slaves. In our times some corporations think it is alright to own life on earth through patents and intellectual property rights (IPR). Patents are granted for inventions, and life is not an invention. These IPR monopolies on seeds are also creating a new bondage and dependency for farmers who are getting trapped in debt to pay royalties. This is why 270,000 Indian farmers have committed suicide. Why is it such an important issue? Seed slavery is ethically important to address because it transforms the Earth family into corporate property. It is ecologically important because with seeds in the hands of five corporations, biodiversity disappears, and is replaced by monocultures of GMOs (genetically modified organisms). It is socially important because without seed sovereignty, there is no food sovereignty. After all, seeds are the first link in the food chain. What is the role of big business in restricting seed supply? The chemical warfare industry transformed itself into the agri-chemical industry. Now the chemical industry has taken over the seed supply through genetic engineering and patents. They want every farmer in every season everywhere in the world to buy their seeds so they can collect royalties and super profits. The corporations, like Monsanto, wrote the Intellectual Property Rights Treaty of the World Trade Organisation. As a Monsanto representative said: ""In writing this treaty, we were the patient, the diagnostician, the physician all in one."" They defined seed saving as a crime to establish seed slavery and force farmers to buy their seed and pay them royalties. You refer to the toxicity and uniformity of the seeds from major corporations. What impact are their actions having on farmers and communities? Last year we wrote a report, The GMO Emperor has no Clothes, which pulled together the impact of GMO patented seeds across the world. The first impact is a seed monopoly and the disappearance of diversity. The second impact is increasing costs. The third impact is higher use of chemicals. The fourth impact is the denial to consumers of the right to know what they are eating. Which companies do you feel are most responsible? Monsanto, Dupont, Syngenta, Basf, Dow. What is the motivation for these companies to act in this way? Super profits and the urge to control nature and society. Do these companies have too much influence on the political system and what are their tactics and their effect? They have too much power and are a threat to our democracy and freedom. They control governments, they control the media, they control research. Look at how they hounded out Dr Arpad Putzai from his job. Most large corporations talk about the need for sustainability, so what would your advice be to these businesses if they were to take corporate responsibility seriously? In the area of seeds and biodiversity my advice to the corporations is simple. You are good at the technologies of warfare. Leave the seeds in the hands of women and small farmers. They have done a far better job. What can be done to prevent these companies from dominating the global seed supply? Build a movement for seed freedom, to save seeds, to protect biodiversity, to reclaim farmers rights, to make patents on seed illegal, to roll back laws like the EU Seed Legislation that are criminalising farmers who use their own seeds. You are planning a fortnight of action on seed freedom from 2-16 October, can two weeks of action actually make any difference against the power of big business? The fortnight of action is to intensify solidarity, synergy and awareness. Our movement for seed freedom will not stop on 16 October. We will continue until the last farmer and last seed is liberated. If this issue is not addressed, what does the future hold? We will witness in our lifetimes the total disappearance of biodiversity from our farms, the disappearance of small farmers, and the end of real food and our food freedom.

162,article,environment/2012/sep/28/study-gm-maize-cancer,Environment,2012-09-28,Study linking GM maize to cancer must be taken seriously by regulators | John Vidal,https://gu.com/p/3amq9,News,Study linking GM maize to cancer must be taken seriously by regulators,"Trial suggesting a GM maize strain causes cancer has attracted a torrent of abuse, but it cannot be swept under the carpet",1341,"Professor Gilles-Eric Séralini, professor of molecular biology at Caen university in France, knows how to inflame the GM industry and its friends. For seven years he and his team have questioned the safety standards applied to varieties of GM maize and tried to re-analyse industry-funded studies presented to governments. The GM industry has traditionally reacted furiously and personally. Séralini has been widely insulted and smeared and last year, in some desperation, he sued Marc Fellous, president of the French Association of Plant Biotechnology, for defamation, and won (although he was only awarded a nominal €1 in damages). But last week, Seralini brought the whole scientific and corporate establishment crashing down on his head. In a peer-reviewed US journal, Food and Chemical Toxicology, he reported the results of a €3.2m study. Fed a diet of Monsanto's Roundup-tolerant GM maize NK603 for two years, or exposed to Roundup over the same period, rats developed higher levels of cancers and died earlier than controls. Séralini suggested that the results could be explained by the endocrine-disrupting effects of Roundup, and overexpression of the transgene in the GMO. This was scientific dynamite. It was the first time that maize containing these specific genes had been tested on rats over two years - nearly their full lifespan - as opposed to the 90-day trials demanded by regulators. Around a dozen long-term studies of different GM crops have failed to find similar effects. Séralini's study also looked at the toxicity of the Roundup herbicide when fed directly to rats. If the study stood up, then the consistent arguments of the industry that its GM maize is safe might be fatally undermined, with immense political, financial and social consequences. But barely had the paper surfaced than it was attracting heavyweight academic criticism. Commentators variously claimed the study to be ""biased"", ""poorly performed"", ""bogus"", ""fraudulent"", ""sub-standard"", ""sloppy agenda-based science"", ""inadequate"" and ""unsatisfactory"". Séralini was said to have ""sought harm"" for the rats, the experiment was dismissed as ""inhumane"" and the research group was called ""partisan"". France was outed as ""the most anti-science country in anti-science Europe"" and vociferous GM supporters such as Mark Lynas urged people to sign a petition demanding full disclosure of the data (only a few hundred have). Meanwhile, GM opponents were said to be the ""climate skeptics of the left"", Séralini and his scientists were labelled ""crafty activists"" and ""anti-science"" and the group that funded the study was accused of ""polluting science communication"" by asking for an embargo on the paper. Séralini and the other authors of the study responded that they were surprised at the ""violence"" of their critics. But it was a triumph for the scientific and corporate establishment which has used similar tactics to crush other scientists like Arpad Pusztai of the Rowett Institute in Scotland, who was sacked after his research suggested GM potatoes damaged the stomach lining and immune system of rats, and David Quist and Ignacio Chapela, who studied the flow of genes from illegally planted GM maize to Mexican wild maize. But now that the dust is settling, let's look at some of the criticisms and Seralini's responses. ""This is not an innocent scientific publication. The study was designed to produce exactly what was observed,"" said Dr Bruce Chassy, professor emeritus of food science at the University of Illinois, who has worked as a consultant for GM companies and has been a member of the US Food and Drug Administration's Food Advisory Council which is fully behind GM. ""This study appears to be without scientific merit,"" said Martina Newell-McGloughlin, director of the International Biotechnology Program at the University of California/Davis, which has close links to Monsanto and other GM companies. ""Although this paper has been published in a peer–reviewed journal with an [Impact Factor] of about 3, there are anomalies throughout the paper that normally should have been corrected or resolved through the peer-review process,"" said Maurice Moloney, InsChief Executive of Rothamsted Research. ""The control group is inadequate to make any deduction,"" said Anthony Trewavas, prominent champion of GM food and a former member of the governing council of Britain's leading plant biotech research organisation, the John Innes Centre. ""We have to ask whether a diet with this level of maize is normal for rats. Another control with an alternative diet should have been included,"" said Dr Wendy Harwood, senior scientist at the John Innes Centre. Monsanto was dismissive: ""This study does not meet minimum acceptable standards for this type of scientific research, the findings are not supported by the data presented, and the conclusions are not relevant for the purpose of safety assessment."" Here are the criticisms in a nutshell and Séralini's responses: 1. The French researchers were accused of using the Sprague Dawley rat strain which is said to be prone to developing cancers. In response Séralini and his team say these are the same rats as used by Monsanto in the 90-day trials which it used to get authorisation for its maize. This strain of rat has been used in most animal feeding trials to evaluate the safety of GM foods, and their results have long been used by the biotech industry to secure approval to market GM products. 2. The sample size of rats was said to be too small. Séralini responded that six is the OECD recommended protocol for GM food safety toxicology studies and he had based his study on the toxicity part of OECD protocol no. 453. This states that for a cancer trial you need a minimum of 50 animals of each sex per test group but for a toxicity trial a minimum of 10 per sex suffices. Monsanto used 20 rats of each sex per group in its feeding trials but only analysed 10, the same number as Séralini. 3. No data was given about the rats' food intake. Seralini says the rats were allowed to eat as much food as they liked. 4. Séralini has not released the raw data from the trial. In response he says he won't release it until the data underpinning Monsanto's authorisation of NK603 in Europe is also made public. 5. His funding was provided by an anti-biotechnology organisation whose scientific board Séralini heads. But he counters that almost all GM research is funded by corporates or by pro-biotech institutions. So where does that leave the public? Despite the concerns over Séralini's methodological flaws, it looks as though the study will not be swept under the carpet. It is the longest study done on this variety of maize and many argue that it must be taken seriously by regulators and governments. French health and safety authorities now plan to investigate NK603 and the study's findings and the European Food Safety Agency has said it will assess the research. Séralini is now demanding that all the data be assessed by an independent international committee, arguing that experts involved in the authorisation of the maize should not be involved. Equally, the study reopens questions about the regulation of GM crops. There has long been concern that these foods have been evaluated poorly and that the companies have taken advantage of lax regulation. The GM industry, which keeps its own research secret, has resisted investigation or any change. In fact, there is one irony that a few scientists have pointed out but who have been drowned out in the furore. Séralini's study was not so much about the dangers of GM technology, but the toxicity of the Roundup herbicide used on the crops. Here's Ottoline Leyser, associate director of the Sainsbury Laboratory, University of Cambridge: ""Like most of the GM debate, this work has very little to do with GM. The authors of the paper do not suggest that the effects are caused by genetic modification. They describe effects of the roundup herbicide itself and effects that they attribute to the activity of the enzyme introduced into the roundup resistant maize. There is good evidence that introducing genes into crops using GM techniques results in fewer changes to the crops than introducing them using conventional breeding.""",,0.031504460046126705
163,article,books/2012/sep/07/vagina-new-biography-naomi-wolf-review,Books,2012-09-07,Vagina: A New Biography by Naomi Wolf – review,https://gu.com/p/3a9xe,Arts,Vagina: A New Biography by Naomi Wolf – review,"Does this book reveal an existential crisis among women or merely tell us more than we wanted to know about its author, asks Jenny Turner",4225,"A couple of years ago, Naomi Wolf signed up to write a book about the vagina. ""I was euphoric, in creative terms … At the same time I was anxious about grappling with such a strong social taboo."" A friend of a friend – ""an impresario whom I will call Alan"" – throws a party for her in his loft, ""a pasta party at which guests could make vagina-shaped pasta"", an idea Wolf says she finds ""funny and sort of charming"" though ""not a thematic twist I would have chosen for myself"". At the party, ""there was a slightly ominous, mischievous stir"" from the kitchen, where guests have been hard at work: ""Flowery or feathery, fluted or fanned, each small sculpture was detailed and different: lovely little white objects against a hand-painted blue Italian ceramic tray."" ""I call those 'cuntini', says Alan, laughing."" ""My heart contracted,"" Naomi responds. Next, she hears a sizzle. ""I got it: ha, sausages … The room had become tense."" Then comes the salmon. ""I flushed, with a kind of despair,"" she writes, adding that the evening as a whole left her so upset, she was unable to write a word of her vagina book for the next six months. ""I felt – on both a creative and a physical level – that I had been punished for 'going somewhere' that women are not supposed to go"", she writes. ""A Rorschach with legs"" is what Natalie Angier calls the vagina in her superb Woman: An Intimate Geography (1999). ""You can make of it practically anything you want, need or dread."" And the same is true, surely, of this sorry tale. Different readers will have different cringe-points, different places in the story at which they start shouting ""Whoah!"" You may be appalled at the thought of a book called Vagina in the first place. How backward-looking, how attention-seeking, can a 21st-century feminist get? You may be fine with vaginas in a book title, less so as a shape of pasta – most people avoid close-up genital chit-chat in mixed culinary situations, and there are obvious reasons for the taboo. You may find the pasta in theory, as Wolf did, ""sweet"" – a quick google brings up vagina cupcakes, pink felt vagina knickers, a commercial range of tricolore pasta from Naples cut in genital shapes – but it's the c-word that upsets you, or the sausages, or the fish. Personally, I particularly disliked the ""impresario whom I will call Alan"", and the ""hand-painted blue Italian ceramic tray"": ugh boasting, ugh sentimental, ugh ugh. I'm not keen on the post-party six-month trauma either. If you're a big enough show-off to have a vagina-pasta party in the first place, I kind of feel you've abjured your right to victimmy tender-plantdom. No doubt that says as much about me and my hangups as it does about anything else. ""I was aware,"" Wolf reports, that when she told people about her topic, ""many people had immediate, probably measurable physical reactions."" Some ""smiled immediately, beautiful heartfelt smiles"". Others ""looked frightened or disgusted, as if I had suddenly produced from my handbag a trout"". Neither covers my own reaction, though it was closer to Monty Python fish-slapping than the heartfelt-smiling thing. I admire, of course, the force-of-nature whorls in the paintings of Georgia O'Keeffe, the magnificent White Hole by Rohan Weallaens in his show with Sarah Lucas, currently showing at Sadie Coles HQ Off-Site. But Judy Chicago and her Dinner Party, Eve Ensler and her Vagina Monologues – it's wretched stuff, po-faced and self-righteous, all the very worst bits of 1970s feminism rolled up in a tube. It's not that it isn't possible to do really excellent work with lots of vaginas in it. Angier's survey, for example, is the book I'd give free to every schoolgirl if I was Michael Gove. Catherine Blackledge's much-overlooked The Story of V (2003) is lucid and thorough, and has some amazing illustrations. On the vagina as symbolic object, The Female Thing by Laura Kipnis (2006) is a sharp, funny, leftwing, Freudian essay about the many ways in which ""having one of these things instead of one of the other things … invariably structures the female experience here on earth"". Most recently, Florence Williams writes in Breasts: A Natural and Unnatural History (Norton, 2012) about how the life of organs commonly thought of as private is always socially and environmentally conditioned, by the fantasies in the ether around them, by the chemicals they absorb. Wolf's book, however, is something else again. Yes, it does a bit of science, and a bit of cultural history too. But mostly, it doesn't need to, because Wolf has found a magic key. ""The vagina and the brain,"" Wolf has discovered, are ""essentially one network, or 'one whole system'"", though at the moment, not a lot of people know this, apart from ""scientists at the most advanced laboratories and clinics around the world"". Taken together, this ""profound brain-vagina connection"" forms ""a gateway to, and medium of, female self-knowledge and consciousness"", mediating ""creativity and transcendence"". You thought Angier was laying it on a bit when she poeticised the vagina as ""a pause between the declarative sentence of the outside world and the mutterings of the viscera""? Well, for Wolf it channels ""a sensibility that feels very much like freedom"". Or if that's too much to deal with, just look on it as ""essentially part of the female soul"". This discovery, Wolf writes, ""started as a historical and cultural journey, but quickly became 'personal and necessary'"". In 2009, she says, when she was 46, her life was outwardly great (aren't they always in this sort of story) – ""emotionally and sexually happy, intellectually excited, and newly in love"". And yet – as is the convention – ""something was becoming terribly wrong"". In her 40s, she explains, Wolf had felt her experience of orgasm deepen and become enriched, leading her to ""see colours as if they were brighter"" and ""the connections between things"" more distinctly. In 2009, though, ""this was changing. I was … losing sensation inside my body."" Worse, her sense of the ""poetic dimension"" was disappearing too. ""Things seemed discrete and unrelated to me … and colours were just colours."" She gets depressed and then despairing: ""It was like a horror movie, as the light and sparkle of the world dialled downward and downward."" It turns out that Wolf has trapped a nerve in her lower back, between the lumbar region and the sacrum. Normally, this ""pelvic nerve"" carries messages between the brain and the clitoris, cervix and vagina, but in Wolf's case, because of the neural damage, the messages from the vagina were cut off. And yet, she still orgasms from her clitoris, no problem. ""Every woman is wired differently,"" her specialist explains. ""Some women's nerves branch more in the vagina; other women's nerves branch more in the clitoris … That accounts for some of the differences in female sexual response."" ""I almost fell off the exam table in astonishment,"" writes the author. ""That's what explained vaginal versus clitoral orgasms? … Not culture, not upbringing, not patriarchy, not feminism, not Freud?"" Once she has picked herself up again, Wolf organises her argument round two main strands. Science, she discovers, has been making lots of progress in understanding the physiology of female sexuality, but nobody tells us about it. ""Why didn't they tell us in eighth grade? … It's changed my whole sense of how we're put together,"" as she said to Emma Brockes in the Guardian this week. But also, this vagina-brain connection has an emotional, even spiritual dimension – ""a 'hole'"" that is ""Goddess-shaped"", no less. She gets surgery to put her back right, and finds her full-spectrum orgasms restored, and with them, the mystical intimations. ""The moving grasses, the sweeping tree branches, the birds calling from invisible locations in the dappled shadows … I thought: it is back."" The first part of the book is called ""Does the Vagina Have a Consciousness?"" Wolf's evidence includes neuroanatomy – ""your dreamy autonomic nervous system, or what scientists call the ANS"" and neurochemistry – ""the dopamine, oxytocin and opioids released by (the) orgasm, which in turn affect (the) brain"". The take-home is basically that just as sensation runs from pelvis to brain, so it runs the other way as well, meaning that ""gestures, touches, kisses and words aren't extras. They are integral parts of the activation of the female ANS."" In other words, Wolf thinks that the sort of sexual pleasure the modern woman is encouraged to seek is far too wham-bam to release women from what she sees as a widespread ""existential depression"", an ""An Epidemic of Female Sexual Unhappiness"". Much of this ""sexual suffering"" Wolf thinks has been systemically imposed on women, across the world and down the centuries: rape and genital mutilation, military, judicial and ritual. ""If you are to subdue and suppress women, and in such a way that they come to do it to themselves …. you must target the vagina."" There's also an interesting bit on the threat posed to the ""happy heterosexual vagina"" by internet pornography. The evidence isn't entirely there yet, but Wolf's argument that heavy porn use seems to follow an addictive pattern, desensitising users to images of violence and causing them to lose interest in affectionate sex with a partner whose name they know, seems increasingly plausible. Though I'm not sure about the impresario-I-will-call-Alan foodie spin: ""The mass-produced, fast-forward, pornographic vagina is to the real vagina what highly processed or GMO food is to slow or organic food."" More surprisingly, she also blames ""second-wave feminism"", ie, the work of the early-1970s Women's Liberation Movement. In The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm (1970), she says, Anne Koedt argued that ""Freud's elevation of the vagina over the clitoris"" was a ""patriarchal plot"" in order that women be ""brainwashed into dependency on men"". An understandable move, Wolf thinks, but overstated, and with unfortunate consequences: ""From the 1970s on, the vagina was recast as rather retro, housewifey and passé"", whereas the clitoris was ""a glamorous, mini-skirt-wearing Gloria Steinem"". But mainly her target seems to be ordinarily lazy boyfs and hubbies, who, she thinks, have to try much harder when appeasing the ""entirely different model of female sexuality"" she dubs ""the Goddess Array"". The quest takes her deep into the erotic texts of the Tantric, Tao and Islamic traditions. It takes her to a shabby hotel in Midtown Manhattan for a weekend workshop in ""sacred-spot massage"" run by ""the surreally juicy"" Caroline Muir (""While all of the women were conventionally attractive, many of the men were not at all""). It takes her to Chalk Farm in north London to visit Mike Lousada, ""the world's nicest former investment banker turned male sexual healer"", famous for having once stared at ""the yoni"" for so long, he saw an image of the Virgin Mary in it. If you want your own ""sacred spot"" expertly rubbed by Muir, Wolf tells us, the hourly rate is $250. Lousada, by contrast, charges only £100. ❦ I read this book in utter bafflement. What is this big news that Wolf has to impart? Vaginas feel stuff, so yes, of course they must be packed with nerves; and nerves, we know, join up with each other at the spine to link into the brain. That's why they call it the central nervous system; that's what being human is all about. Feet, too, join up with the CNS – thus reflexologists, and why bunions are so painful. And so do the intestines, giving rise to the extremely interesting ""Gut Feminism"" of Elizabeth A Wilson at Emory University in Atlanta – digestive organs as ""psychically alive"", ""the enteric character"" of mood, ""how biology can be an ally for those of us building models of mind-body that tax the limits of Cartesian dualism"". In other words, the closer you look at attempts to argue that mind and body are not completely wrapped up in each other, the more you will see all sorts of connections, biological and symbolic and liminally teetering in between. ""Having a body punctured by so many openings and canals,"" Kipnis writes, ""blurs the distinction between inside and outside, self and world. The apertures invariably take on emotional resonance … She's so 'open'. He's a real 'tightass'."" And of course the c-word, in all its abject force. At the beginning of her Vagina book, Wolf says that her theory of ""biological consciousness"" comes in part from William James's mighty The Variety of Religious Experience (1902) – ""the issue of neurology as a substratum for these common mystical experiences"", ie, that particular brain-states may give people a feeling that they are, for a moment, in touch with God. After that, though, she doesn't mention James again. Which is a pity, because one great thing about the James book is the way he doesn't pooh-pooh these passing feelings, while also recognising that any individual attempt to ""locate"" them can only end in idiotic hubris: ""We must frankly recognise the fact that we live in partial systems and that parts are not interchangeable in the spiritual life."" Those selfish genes with their shoulder-pads, grabbing evolutionary advantages for the alpha males; dopamine and oxytocin, gambolling like SpongeBob SquarePants round the reptile brain; the stories told by the popular-science writers can only ever just be stories, partial facts filled out with cartoonishly consoling fictions. So yes, body and mind are completely part and parcel. But no, this doesn't mean the connections are easy to conceptualise: neither goddesses nor Numskulls nor ghosts in the machine. Remember Wolf's ""astonishment"" when her doctor told her that every woman's pelvic wiring is slightly different? She should be more than astonished, I feel. She should be daunted and delighted at the great polymorphous cloud ahead of her, every individual equal and yet completely different – vagina and/or clitoris and/or all of these or none; fingers and/or penises and/or hair dryers and/or veg. But Wolf does not want to think about such glories. ""One of my primary themes is the exploration of heterosexual women's physical and emotional interactions with men … Not because I think that lesbian and bisexual arousal, orgasm, relationships or mind-body connections are any less fascinating,"" but because women are ""so complex and so worthy of careful, individualistic attention that I do not believe that the politically correct approach of lumping all female experience together … can do justice to the variations of female sexualities and their emotional counterparts."" Lesbians, anuses and Betty Dodson do at least get passing mentions. Asexuality, blowjobs, sexual fantasy, do not figure at all. The pulsing cloud becomes particularly shrunken in the neurochemistry chapter. ""People differ from one another at every juncture of the dopamine matrix,"" Angier wrote of ""today's It-neurotransmitter"" a few years ago in the New York Times. ""In the tonal background pace at which their dopamine neurons rhythmically fire, the avidity with which the cells spike in response to need or news …"" For Wolf, on the other hand, dopamine is simply ""the ultimate feminist chemical in the female brain"". Whereas serotonin emerges as a baddie, particularly in its most famous role as the brain-chemical boosted by popular SSRI anti-depressants such as Prozac. ""Women far outnumber men in being prescribed SSRIs. Are these same millions … warned that SSRIs may well send their libido and ability to experience orgasm plummeting?"" (""Low sex drive"", I read at second place on the ""Common Side Effects"" page on the NHS Choices website. Wolf may be appalled that many women seem resigned to sexual self-bludgeoning in exchange for the basic ability to keep going, but a lot of evidence suggests they do.) Oxytocin, best known for its part in stimulating childbirth and lactation, she dubs ""the cuddle hormone"" and ""women's emotional superpower"". Top advice for women who ""want to have hot anonymous sex with some guy … but don't want to fall in love with him … discourage him from interacting with their nipples."" Because if he does get his hands on your boobies, you'll have to marry him, obvs! The stuff about rape and sexual violence is just strange. Wolf's main argument – that rape is at least half-consciously a subordinating tactic deployed by men – has been feminist orthodoxy since 1975, when Susan Brownmiller published her canonical Against Our Will: Men and Women and Rape: ""From prehistoric times to the present, I believe, rape has played a critical function. It is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear."" And yet, Wolf says that Brownmiller, like others of her generation, writes about rape while following an ""individualised reading of sexuality posited by Freud"", which is surely just not so. Wolf's take on classic women's liberation in general is perverse. Koedt, it's true, did mistakenly write that ""the vagina is not a highly sensitive area"" in her legendary paper. But her main thrust was to open, not close, sexual possibility for women; besides which, other feminists just went as fancy took them. Germaine Greer in 1971, for example: ""To develop the muscles of the pubococcygeal region, think of something nice and contract the buttocks rhythmically … You might even succeed in making the whole pelvis awake to love and beauty."" As for this ""gendered sense of self that is shining, without damage, without anxiety or fear"", this ""radiant part of the universal feminine"" that is activated by obeisance to the ""Goddess Array"" … What if you're a woman who practises forms of sex that bypass the vaginal? What if you were born without a vagina, or with two vaginas, or have a female-looking vulva, but are intersex inside? What if you are biologically and culturally female, but want to smirk or vomit at the very thought of a ""Goddess"" anywhere near you? What happens to ""the universal feminine"" then? Naomi Wolf, presumably, is like many of us, a middle-aged woman who has been thinking a lot about spiritual matters, as middle-aged women often do. Her body has been changing – which also happens – and in her case, she's also had that miserable injury, which yes, I can see would make you look at your sexuality anew. But it takes a particular way of looking at things to extrapolate from that to the shining Goddess. Wolf, this book tells us, has also been looking at images of sexual awakening in Christina Rossetti and Kate Chopin, because she has recently gone ""back to graduate school"". And discussing orgasmic rats with ""a group of brilliant young women"" at ""a cottage on an old farm"". Chatting with Mike Lousada for ""a London newspaper"". And visiting, in 2004, a refugee centre for women raped during the civil war in Sierra Leone. All evidence, one way or another, for this spiritual-emotional-neurological network. All of it really just connected by the life, the interests and the ego of Naomi Wolf herself. ❦ Back in 1990, I remember watching the young Wolf on television, with a panel of older feminist writers, discussing her first book, the bestselling The Beauty Myth (1990). These older feminists – I can't remember who any of them were – were being just horrible. Their gist was that Wolf, being 28 and good-looking and well groomed, had no right to speak out about any ""beauty myth"", or to call herself a feminist at all. Awful, I remember thinking, but also interesting – the way older women so often hate letting the younger ones have their turn. I wrote an article about it for a long-dead magazine called City Limits, which was where I was working, in my first London job. And I guess that must be why I have a fuzzy memory of an evening shortly after, when Wolf came for tea to my Brixton house-share, together with my friend and then City Limits colleague, now Guardian columnist Deborah Orr. It was a nice evening, I remember; I made a huge spanakopita and Wolf was lovely. Only then, Deborah or I said something mildly critical of some point or another, and Wolf fought back. The forcefulness, the mental agility, the lack of embarrassment! The sense of entitlement and mission, the self-belief! It was quite an insight into what it takes to be a celebrity feminist. I immediately saw that I would never cut it. And so, more than 20 years later, I'm still bodging my spanakopitas in south-east London while Wolf has long been a figure of world renown. After The Beauty Myth, Wolf wrote a sort of sequel to it, Fire With Fire – her own attempt to work out why feminists so often seem to hate each other and what to do about it. The decade subsequent, she published three memoir-based personal-is-political numbers, Promiscuities – herself and her friends as teenagers; Misconceptions – as young mothers; The Tree House – as burnt-out middle-agers, a condition Wolf remedied by doing up her country house with the help of her old dad. Throughout, I watched her from a distance, observing how tough the job of celebrity feminist can be: you have to keep publishing and opining, no matter whether you have much you really want to say. You have to present your ideas to public scrutiny even if they're still half-baked. A single wobble, and the media will leap – do a google, for example, on Naomi Wolf-Katy Perry. Naomi Wolf-abortion-New Republic. Naomi Woolf-Al Gore-consultant. Naomi Wolf-New York magazine-Harold Bloom. Naomi Wolf-rape-Julian Assange. Then after The Tree House, Wolf suddenly moved sideways, with two plain, useful books on civil liberties and the right to protest in the age of George W Bush. Neither The End of America (2007) nor Give Me Freedom (2008) was published in this country, but readers will have heard about them when Wolf was arrested – in her evening clothes – at an Occupy! demonstration in New York City last year. (Good-oh, I remember thinking when I saw it. Now, though, I catch myself checking dates and wondering about the state of her pelvic nerve.) Between jobs, I guess Wolf has never stopped trying to think big thoughts about women and politics and feminism. How some things change and others don't. How the same things need to be said afresh for every generation, and how hard it is to bear this, as you yourself get older and feel you've heard it all before. How much you'd like to warn the youngsters, except that all they hear when you try it is their utter conviction that they themselves will never end up like you. Exhaustion, irritation, frustration at all these goldfish-brain debatelets, repeating themselves, round and round. In a world with Jessie J and Jamie Clayton in it, Caster Semenya and the work of Judith Butler, why are we still letting one of the Anglophone world's most famous feminists waste everyone's time with all this burble about the ""universal feminine"" with its ""Goddess-shaped"" hole? Funnily enough, it was on this very topic that Laura Kipnis's vagina book began. ""Female progress – how's that going? Let's see. Gender barriers have largely crumbled (some exceptions remain), the dominant paradigms of patriarchy have mainly eroded (some exceptions remain), women have increasing economic dependence from men if they choose to (though many don't). But then you keep stumbling across the tracks of a certain … ambivalence. No, not the backlash against feminism – I mean the ambivalence among women themselves."" For Kipnis, the big problem with feminism – an open, bold, modern movement, aimed at getting power for women, fair and square – is that it gets confused with femininity, an ancient, occult body of lore women use to trick men into looking after them; and few of even the most famous feminists have entirely clarified the difference. Or as Kipnis puts it: ""Feminism ('don't call me honey, dickhead') and femininity ('I just found the world's best push-up bra!') are in a big catfight, nowhere more than within each individual female psyche."" Kipnis would probably see in Wolf's book just another iteration of the basic problem. The main reason for the current ""epidemic of sexual sorrow"" is not so much that ""the vagina is being disrespected"", but that women who should know better underestimate the complexity of Kipnis's ""female thing"" – ""the female psyche of course"", as Kipnis puts it, the experience of living with ""this small furry thing"" in a world that doles out privilege according to anatomy at birth. So yes, nobody disagrees that women are, on the whole, sad and rancorous, and that the problem amounts to what Wolf calls an ""existential depression"". If not the yoni, under the Tantric management of Mike Lousada, what other wisdoms are there to save us now? ""I had to say The Force,"" Wolf told the Sunday Times, when they asked for her favourite word for the vagina. And maybe it was that, or maybe it was the bit in Kipnis about the ""small furry thing"", but the vision that came to me at this point was the Star Wars poster on the wall of my son's bedroom, a picture of Yoda with a book tucked under his arm. ""Read and The Force is with you,"" it says; it's an ad from the American Library Association. And also a reminder – not for the first time – that in the struggle for good sex over all the evils of the universe, the most potent and far-reaching weapons are not vaginas or any other bodily organs, but research, ideas, thinking – not yonis or even ""the Goddess"", but carefully weighed and thought-through words.",,0.11669402430766072
164,article,business/2012/aug/21/glencore-us-drought-good-for-business,Business,2012-08-21,Glencore food chief says US drought is 'good for business',https://gu.com/p/39qh6,News,Glencore food chief says US drought is 'good for business',"Chris Mahoney, Glencore director of agricultural products said US drought gave the firm a chance to profit from soaring prices",547,"The head of Glencore's food trading business has said the worst drought to hit the US since the 1930s will be ""good for Glencore"" because it will lead to opportunities to exploit soaring prices. Chris Mahoney, the trader's director of agricultural products, who owns about £500m of Glencore shares, said the devastating US drought had created an opportunity for the company to make much more money. ""In terms of the outlook for the balance of the year, the environment is a good one. High prices, lots of volatility, a lot of dislocation, tightness, a lot of arbitrage opportunities [the purchase and sale of an asset in order to profit from price differences in different markets],"" he said on a conference call . Mahoney said Glencore, which reported pre-tax profits of $2.2bn (£1.4bn), would be able to exploit the drought to its advantage, especially after its takeover of Canadian grain trader Viterra. ""I think we will both be able to provide the world with solutions, getting stuff to where it's needed quickly and timely, and that should be good for Glencore."" The blistering heat in the US has destroyed 45% of the corn and 35% of the soya bean crop, pushing the price of the commodities to record highs. Overall global food prices rose by 6% in July, according to the UN. The drought is so severe that G20 nations are considering holding a crisis summit. The last severe food crisis, in 2008, sparked riots in cities from the Caribbean to the far east. The United Nations food agency warned this month that ""there is potential for a situation to develop like we had back in 2007-08."" Abdolreza Abbassian, senior economist and grain analyst at the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation, told Reuters: ""There is an expectation that this time around we will not pursue bad policies and intervene in the market by restrictions, and if that doesn't happen we will not see such a serious situation as 2007-08. But if those policies get repeated, anything is possible."" Raj Patel, an expert in the global food trade and former UN employee, said Glencore and other multinational food traders were in a ""fine position to make money from a crisis because they've pushed for an international economic system that relies on them"". ""They [Glencore] are millionaires making money from other people's misery caused by the drought,"" he said. ""It's the sad fact of how the international food system – that they pushed for and our governments gave to them – works. ""It's unsurprising that a crisis is a revenue generator."" Oxfam has called on governments to intervene in the international food system to relieve the pressure on poor people in developing countries. ""These latest [food price] figures prove yet again that there is something fundamentally flawed in the way we produce and distribute food around the world,"" said Hannah Stoddart, Oxfam's head of economic justice policy. ""For too long our leaders have stood by complacently, while up to a billion people go hungry worldwide."" Jeremy Grantham, chief investment strategist of asset management firm GMO, has warned: ""We are five years into a severe global food crisis that is very unlikely to go away."" Glencore has previously attracted attention by selling more than £50m worth of wheat to the World Food Programme.",,0.02636363636363638
165,article,sustainable-business/sustainability-problems-few-solutions,Guardian Sustainable Business,2012-07-16,Sustainability problems galore but precious few solutions,https://gu.com/p/393bx,,Sustainability problems galore but precious few solutions,"While the 250 high level participants at the University of Oxford's Resource conference are clear about why short termism is so dominant, there is no silver bullet that will save civilisation<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/blog/food-water-energy-resource-efficiency1?intcmp=122"">See Jo's live blog from the second day of the Resource sustainability conference</a>",1476,"Out of the mouths of babes, or in this case a teenager. I took my 16-year-old son to the Resource sustainability conference at the University of Oxford, which brought 250 of the most senior global experts in the field of politics, business and finance together to find a way through the sustainability challenges we face. At the end, I turned to ask him what he had made of the various sessions, that ranged from the role of subsidies to resource scarcity. ""They seem to have a good understanding of what the problems are,"" he said. ""But they did not seem to come up with many concrete solutions."" And therein lies the problem. What we heard time and time again were the reasons why it is so hard to take radical action. David Milliband said we need a carbon tax, Lord Mandelson said we should do away with 'bad' subsidies, Sir David King said we should stop eating beef, and Donald MacDonald, director of the trustee board of the BT Pension Scheme, said asset owners need to stop looking at daily and weekly share price movements and concentrate on the far horizon. But all of them talked about the complexity of the issues and why it is so hard to change the current system. So why do many high level speakers believe we are locked into the status quo? Short-term thinking The trustees of asset owners, such as pension funds, are not investment experts and are terrified of making mistakes and ruining their reputations so take the safest short-term approach, even though this is against the interests of their members. Asset managers are often only on annual contracts and are therefore not incentivised to take a long-term approach, so they put pressure on companies to keep pushing profits higher, even at the expense of future success, never mind future generations. They too are terrified of getting it wrong and losing their reputations. Company directors are generally happy to play along with all this because their bonuses are based on share price performance over a maximum of only three years, and often a much shorter time span. They may not like being slaves to quarterly earnings but they are happy to go along with the current way of doing things because they would rather follow the crowd than stick out like a sore thumb. Consumption as a means to happiness To keep the asset managers and owners onside, companies have to shift as many products and services as possible to keep the profits rolling in, which means it is in their interests to turn us citizens into consumer zombies. Because most citizens haven fallen into the trap of thinking that happiness is based on the number of possessions and experiences they can muster, they don't want to even countenance giving up any of the benefits they are addicted to. Political problems Then we come to the politicians who are locked into election cycles so they are not prepared to put their reputations on the line by putting in place laws to change our behaviour. As David Milliband, speaking at the conference said, why take decisions that negatively impact voters in the short term, when the benefits are going to be invisible for some time to come. And finally, holding the current system tightly in place are the wealthy and powerful who stand to lose their privileges if things change, and who therefore use their billions to buy up political systems in the US and many other parts of the world. The fishing metaphor So why are we finding it so difficult to break out of our myopic approach? Professor Lynn Stout, of Cornell Law School, used a fishing metaphor to explain. If everyone is using a fishing rod to fish in a lake, that's all fine. But as soon as someone comes along and starts fishing with sticks of dynamite, everyone feels the need to start using explosives for fear there will be nothing left for them. ""If you are an investor for the long term, you cannot succeed if others are pressurising companies to act in the short term, so there is a race to the bottom,"" she says. When I was doing my masters degree in responsibility in business practice at Bath University, which has since moved to Ashridge, we spent an afternoon playing a fishing game, in which each team was asked to act in their own best interests. Within a very short time, pretty much every group had amassed the largest possible fleet of trawlers, and not long after, fish stocks collapsed. It was not just the desire to secure supplies and expand that cast a spell upon us, but also the egoic adrenaline from wanting to be top of the pile. Not so very different from the real world. While there was general agreement in Oxford about the problems, there was no real consensus about the way out of this sorry state of affairs. Is the glass half empty or half full? Jeremy Grantham, one of the world's most influential figures in finance, who runs the highly successful GMO fund management firm, is pessimistic we can find a way through, admitting to seeing the glass as three-quarters empty. He says the problems we face are already far greater than we are prepared to admit to, and that a combination of vested interests, lack of political courage and lethargy suggest that we may not be able to head off disaster. He summed it up by quoting Churchill: ""The era of procrastination, of half-measures, of soothing and baffling expedients, of delays is coming to its close. In its place we are entering a period of consequences."" Former US president Bill Clinton, on the other hand, said he sees the glass as half full and that he intuitively believes, that we will be able to ""slip the noose"" and avoid the collapse of civilisation. While he acknowledged that the political process is largely blocked, he suggested the myriad of small steps being taken by governments, businesses and civil society can create the foundation for more radical change. Clinton gave the example of the near 5,000 projects underway by the C40 group of cities, which now encompasses 58 cities containing 8% of the global population. ""Good government policies can make a big difference but if they are not here, there is still a lot that can be done,"" said Clinton. He said broader stakeholder engagement was essential and highlighted how President Obama had worked to agree transforming the fuel efficiency of the American car industry, by bringing together labour, management, government and environmental groups. ""We have got to get back to a stakeholder society where one stakeholder does not get an advantage from the skin they put in the game,"" he said. Clinton pointed out that collaboration was important also on the global stage but that there would only be peace between countries if there was a recognition of the need to share the world's resources. ""Either we have a policy of shared benefits and responsibility or we act as though each struggle is a zero sum game,"" he said. Changing the ways of the world Both Clinton and his old pal Amory Lovins, founder of the Rocky Mountain Institute, pointed out that many solutions already existed to the world's problems but they needed to be scaled up. Lovins suggested, for example, that light composite materials could transform the car industry while retrofitting buildings could vastly reduce the use of energy. But while many think that new technologies will save the day, by helping us to be far more resource efficient, there was also a strong sense that what is really needed is a fundamental shift in the way people view their lives and their responsibilities. Milliband spoke of the need for a mass mobilisation of citizens, while Clinton said the future would only be bright if we collaborate more, rather than concentrating on each others' differences. Pointing to the human genome, he said: ""If you look round this room, differences in race, gender and body shape are rooted in one half of 1% of your genes but 99.5% of thinking is about how we are different. ""What we need is a different level of consciousness that weighs in a different way the competing claims of the common good and private gain, co-operation and conflict, of yesterday and tomorrow."" Sir David King, the former chief government scientist, who is director of the Smith School, was given the job of summing up the two day conference. Highlighting the need for each and every one of us to start taking responsibility, he quoted from the French philosopher Voltaire: ""No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible.""

166,article,sustainable-business/blog/food-water-energy-resource-efficiency,Guardian Sustainable Business,2012-07-12,"Live blog from Oxford University: food, water and energy for all",https://gu.com/p/39x6d,,"Live blog from Oxford University: food, water and energy for all","Jo Confino blogs live from the high level <a href=""http://http://www.reversethefuture.org/resource2012/"">Resource</a> sustainability conference at Oxford University's Smith School, which is looking at new ways to manage resources and mitigate the risks of scarcity",3640,"9.34am: Welcome to Resource conference at the Smith School, Oxford Welcome to my live blog from the Smith School in Oxford where there is a fantastic line-up of speakers over the next two days to talk about the energy, water and food nexus and the role of investors in supporting the transition to a green economy. Today we have discussions on the economics of resource scarcity, meeting future energy demands, disruptive innovations and how resource efficiency translates into shareholder value. Those speaking include Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, chairman of Nestle, Jeremy Grantham, founder of GMO and Andy Wales, head of sustainable development at SAB Miller. Tomorrow will have a focus on the link between politics and economics and will include Bill Clinton, David Milliband and Tony Giddens from the London School of Economics. I hope you enjoy having a ring side seat at this invitation-only event and that by the end of it, we have all learnt something useful. Sir David King, former government chief scientist and director of the Smith School, wants this event to be about finding solutions rather than just another round of talking. Let's see if they succeed. Apologies in advance for any typos but I don't have a back-up in London for part of the day and my typing is not as good as I would like. 9.56am: Coming up: Amartya Sen on resource scarcity Looking forward to the session coming soon with Jonathan Dimbleby interviewing Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen on the economics of resource scarcity. Key questions include the tools and mechanisms to redress market failures and how will increasing resource constraints affect pricing, distribution and volatility. he is speaking in the next few minutes. 10.09am: Amartya Sen on resource scarcity What is necessary for us is to point out the causal connections for the problems we have, such as womens' empowerment, which would help to reduce population growth and increase economic livelihoods. What is the role of the investors who tend to think short-term and what is his message to them: There have been terrible mistakes made but we need to look at changing the financial incentives. If you look at solar, it does not impact on global warming or suffer the catastrophic impacts of nuclear so we need more tax incentives for renewables and taking them away from the fossil-fuel industry. The whole idea of asking people to be responsible but not give incentives leads to schizophrenia. Technological reseearch will take place only when investors think there is money to be made and this is another reason for tax incentives. 10.13am: Amartya Sen Sen says fracking has an enormous environmental impacts in the areas it takes place. He says nuclear offers the chance of huge disaster from human error, natural disasters and the threat of terrorism, but this is not taken into account when looking at the benefits of solar. The world is dotted with nuclear power stations, so even small probabilities of risk add up to a very large risk. 10.20am: Amartya Sen on food How are we going to feed a growing population and what is the role of the private sector? The economic reasoning is pretty clear which is the problem is that people are getting richer and this is driving much of the increase in demand for food, and this will increase. Sen says that governments need to intervene and regulate the markets and provide appropriate incentives. Sen says he sees the glass as both half empty and half full and we can make the glass much more full if we think intelligently. 11.00am: David Nabarro, UN Secretary General's special representative on food security and nutrition Nabarro says Rio +20 showed that governments cannot find answers to the world's problems on their own and that civil society and business must become more involved. He warns there are increasing risks of wars from inequities and these must be dealt with, otherwise the future will be very difficult. We need to look at our institutions and political processes to amend them. 11.06am: David Nabarro on food He says there are several areas of promising action. The coming together of business, financial institutions and governments to look at new ways of investing in agriculture. He says Grow Africa has created new multi-stakeholder working and has real potential for progress. There are 30-40 other multiple-stakeholder groups that are going to create new ways of development. Second area is there are major poltiical groups like the G8 and regional groups putting equity of access at the centre of the political discourse. There are also new governance structures being created for mutli-stakeholder dialogues. Is it enough? No it is not, but the future of the work on food and nutrition needs correct policies and social contracts for participation, combined with the application of science. The old-style idea that we can pull a group of political leaders together to solve problems is long gone. 11.10am: Paul Conway, vice chairman of Cargill on food Conway says too many governments lack the air in their tyres to complete the Doha round of trade talks and only a few countries are showing leadership. He says there will need to be more trade to solve food problems as large populations are often not where food production is. He also says there needs to more productivity and governments must provide the right environment for this. But government cannot fix the problems, and must instead provide the ground on which business and NGOs can collaborate. There is also the risk of protectionism as witnessed recently by governments stopping exports of food as soon as problems arise. 11.16am: President Paul Kagame of Rwanda Kagame says on the issue of food: ""We understand the problems and what needs to be done. There ae resources out there that can be brought to bear. ""The main problem lies in people working together and doing what needs to be done. When people know what needs to be done, they often don't do it. ""If we continue to collaborate, I don't see why we cannot make good progress."" 11.43am: The role of the meat industry Professor Charles Godfray, director of the Oxford Marlin programme on the future of food at the University of Oxford, says the statistics on meat consumption are pretty frightening and there are no obvious answers. One route is education so that people know the health and environmental advantages, but this will never reduce demand as required. The other route is political but at the moment there is no possibility of politicians taking action as electorates willl not accept meat reduction. He therefore says we need to have a sophisticated debate to legitimise governments to take action. Godfray also warns that few people recognise the scale of political and social problems we face if nothing is done to produce more food and distribute it equitably. Not only will we will see a massive increase of demand but also many shocks to the supply. He says business has a vital role to play in helping create a food system that provides food security and unleashes the innovation of the proivate sector while similtaneously protecting the poortest. Not only is this the right thing to do and if we do not, it willl lead to enormous political and social dislocation at a scale that few can now envisage. Paul Conway, the vice chairman of Cargill, said that meat consumption in the western world is not growing but you cannot tell people in the developing world they cannot eat meat. He said methane was a serious problem and they are looking to formulate livestock food that creates a more efficient conversion, leading to lower emissions. 11.56am: New collaboratons What's already coming out of the conference is the recognition that old-style multilateral negotiations are a thing of the past in terms of solving the world's sustainability challenges. This very much reflects the feelings at Rio+20 that the future lies in new forms of partnerships and collaborations between business, civil society and individual governments and regional alliances. But David Nabarro, the UN general secetary's special representative on food security and nutrition, warned that this patchwork of the coaltions of the willing can cause confusion if there is not a consensus on the direction of travel and the desired goals. On the issue of food, Nabarro does believe this happened in Rio, with five key objectives. The eliminatiion of hunger, the creation of sustainable agriculture, more produtive smalholder, big reductions in food waste and wasteful consumpiton, and also improvements in nutrition. He says: Ban Ki-moon's zero hunger challenge; that is the post Rio compass on all our work on food and there is a reasonable chance that if enough stakeholders align behind this, we can all move in the same direction."" 12.20pm: Meeting future energy demand Professor Sir Chris Llewellyn Smith, director of energy research, University of Oxford, paints a bleak picture on energy, which he says is absolutely key as without that we cannot tackle all the other problems in the world. He says governments do not follow up on pledges on energy reductions and meanwhile, demand is going to continue shooting up, particularly in the developing world. Changing human behaviour is difficult and if people save energy in one place, they think they can use more elsewhere. Smith also says you can redesign cities but this is very slow because much infrastructure is already in place. On top of this, the only serious renewable at the moment is hydro so there needs to be a vast increase in other renewables but these are expensive. What he shows is just how difficult it is to change. 12.38pm: BG chairman attacks oil and gas indusry over fracking Andrew Gould, chairman of BG Group, has warned the oil and gas industry that they need to radically change the way they approach fracking if the industry to have any long-term future. He admitted that companies in the past have used a ""blitzed technique"" which is essentially that ""you frack as much as you can and hope you open up a route."" He said the reason for this is that the oil and gas industry has been using classic petroleum measurements that do not apply to shale. He says the industry has to ""eventually identify the way that works so that the size and number of frackings will decrease and if it does not happen, the industry will never take off."" Gould said that much more work also needs to be done to ensure that drilling fluids and oil and gas do not migrate and pollute natural water aquifers. On top of all this, Gould said much more must be done to ensure the systematic capture of methane and that companies need to engage with local communities. If all these changes were carried out, Gould said it would not do much to increase the cost of fracking. He said that if you look at satellite shots of the pockmarked landscape of previous fracking in the United States, it is ""horrifying."" He said the industry tends to get in front of itself and now has to prove it can be environmentally conscious. 12.51pm: Carbon taxes Professor Sir Chris Llewellyn Smith, director of energy research, University of Oxford, says the absence of a carbon taxation should be seen as destroying the planet. He calls for subsidies for renewables and that subsidies for fossil fuels should be cut. However, he warns that vested interests always try to keep subsidies in place and that there should always be a route to phase them out. What investors need is certainty about how the future looks, so they can price this into their plans. 1.35pm: Nestle chairman warns that water presents us with a global crisis Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, chairman of Nestle, says there is little recognition in society of just how important water is for our social and economic livelihood and how vulnerable we are from overuse. Interestingly he also pointed out that new technologies across sectors is leading to increasing water usage. Brabeck-Letmathe said that not only has water been primarily responsible for people living longer but also for extraordinary GDP growth. In the past, with a population of 2.5bn, we did not even have to think about water but now we are using it unsustainably. He says: ""In 2005 we were for the first time using water unsustainably and for the first time today we are using non sustainable water. We are now taking it away from the environment,"" which is leading to natural disasters. Brabeck-Letmathe said that in the future we will not have the water to produce the energy we need, nor to produce the food for an increasing population. He says research of 154 water basins does show there are solutions to balance sustainable water use with economic growth and 240 different levers of change have been identified. ""There are sufficient possibilities to bring water usage to balance,"" he says, ""but it needs political decisions and a better understanding of the water supply. ""It is clear that if we are not tackling this issue, which is not the next 100 years. This problem is of today. We are already using too much water."" 2.16pm: Nestle chairman in devastating critique of biofuels The chairman of Nestle has launched a devastating critique of biofuels and called for a ban on plantations that replace food production. ""We are taking away water from where we need it most, to assure food supply,"" says Peter Brabeck-Letmathe ""I am not against biofuels but against replacing food for fuel, and if we came to this simple decision to stop doing this, we would be stabilising raw materials prices for food."" Brabeck-Letmathe said the single most important political decision made in the last five years, was to go ahead with subsidising biofuels and this had come about because of a silo mentaility. He said the biofuels had been given a beautiful sounding name that gave it the aura of being ""about life"" but behind this facade was a direct attempt by politicians to pass on subsidies to farmers. He says: ""People did not understand and some still don't that the food market and the energy market is the same market."" and that the result of replacing 20% of land used for food would lead to spiralling costs. He also says that if water had been given a fair value, then a decision would never have been taken to go ahead with biofuels, as each litre needed 9100 litres of water. The Nestle chairman's criticism was echoed by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, minister of environment and water resources in Singapore, who said that biofuel production had been encouraged through ""stupid subsidies"" and he had witnessed peat lands and forests being destroyed to create biofuels, creating more carbon emissions then would have been saved through switching from fossil fuels. 3.27pm: If you read Jeremy Grantham's predictions of the future, pour yourself a stiff drink first If you are depressed about the sustainability challenges of our age, you will be reaching for the bottle if you listen to Jeremy Grantham, the head of successful fund manager GMO. Although Grantham says he is a cheerful pessimist, seeing the glass as three-quarters empty, but there was precious little liquid to see after hearing his view of the world. He says that it is possible to adapt to our current circumstances, but the likelihood of that happening is limited due to a lack of courageous politicians, vested interests, inertia and dedication to short-termism. While it may be possible to stop the global population at 10 billion, the carrying capacity of the planet is likely to be less than five billion. Added to this is the extraordinary demands for raw materials from China, which now uses 59% of the world's cement, 48% of all coal, 45% of all steel and 47% of all pigs. Beyond that, even if we get far better at recycling, ""metal is slipping through our fingers,"" and water scarcity will lead to wars. Water problems are self-inflicted because the problem is caused by waste and a lack of valuing it in terms of pricing. Soil erosion is accelerating and we are at a peak of using fertilisers because prices have jumped five-fold and availability will be limited in the future. Beyond that, the increase in beef consumption is eating into the ability to produce crops such as rice and wheat. Grantham says that climate instability will lead to more unprecedented weather changes and this will cause a ruinous drop in food production. Beyond all this, scientists have been underestimating the threat from climate change and that the problem is far worse than most people so far recognise. ""Almost all climate scientists recognise the problem is worse that they are saying,"" he says. Beyond this, food currently accounts for at least 40% of poor household incomes and with food prices likely to double over the next 20 years, ""who will pay for this?"" Perhaps Grantham's greatest vitriol is aimed at incentives for the use of US maize for producing ethanol. As he points out, the maize needed to produce the fuel to fill one tank of one SUV, would feed an Indian person for a year. Grantham finishes up by quoting Churchill: ""The era of procrastination, of half-measures, of soothing and baffling expedients, of delays is coming to its close. In its place we are entering a period of consequences."" How are you feeling now? 3.55pm: A little known fact: An aircraft carrier does an average of 12 inches per gallon of fuel If you worry about the miles per gallon of your car, spare a thought for rear admiral Neil Morisetti, the climate and energy security envoy of the UK Ministry of Defence. When he was in charge of an aircraft carrier, he calculated that he used to get 12 inches for every gallon of fuel he used. Morisetti uses this example to point out that the Ministry of Defence is increasingly needing to think, like other businesses, how to reduce its reliance on fossil-fuels. Without fuel, the army cannot fight but securing supplies is increasingly difficult, and Morisetti gives the example of the problems with getting fuel to troops in Afghanistan. More than this, it has to be protected, it ties people down, and the cost of fuel in war zones is 10 times the normal price. ""We have to have an energy plan which recognises we need to reduce costs and risks by changing our behaviour,"" he says. ""For example big bits of kit needs generators while smaller bits of kids can use batteries."" 4.32pm: How even Unilever is struggling to get any investor interest in its sustainability performance If you are under any illusion that investors are interested in sustainability, then go and speak to Unilever's finance director, Jean-Marc Huet. Even though Unilever is a leader in building social, ethical and environmental measures into the heart of its business, investors couldn't be less interested. Huet says that when he goes around presenting the multinational's financial performance, ""next to no-one"" asks about sustainability in general and resource efficiency in particular. Huet has therefore gone in search of investors who are interested in discussing these aspects, albeit with little success, and has spoken with other companies who share the same experience. Given this depressing situation, Huet says it is likely that integrated reporting, which gives equal weight between financial and non-financial measures, is the best way forward. While Huet says ""this has to be the way to go,"" he warns that trying to tie down effective measures for non-financial areas is no easy task. ""A lot of people are talking about integrated reporting but I am still concentrating on demonstrating that our numbers are correct,"" he says. Huet says we need to get to a position where companies are not just giving profit warnings, but also resource efficiency warnings. When asked if Unilever's own pension fund is taking these issues seriously, Huet admits it could do more but adds that this issue is currently being discussed. The reason why Huet's comments are more than of just passing interest is that there are fears at senior levels of the sustainability movement, that Unilever could be at risk if it suffers from a dip in its financial performance. Peter Bakker, president of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, told me in Rio the other week that if investors took the sustainability work of Unilever CEO Paul Polman seriously, then he would be considered a hero. As it is, if the company's profits take a hit, people will blame it on Polman's sustainable living plan and see its work in this field as a liability. 5.09pm: Moving from vision to action I have been speaking to a few key delegates at the conference and the general impression is we need to move from high level visioning to practical action. I think there is a general feeling in the sustainability world that we need to take more time to show solutions working on the ground, and to learn best practice, so that we can take more experiments to scale. The key point is that words are not going to save humanity and stop the planet being degraded. The time for talking is over, the time for action is upon us. 5.11pm: Today is over but tomorrow is another day..... My hands are starting to hurt so I am going to wrap up for the day. But please join us tomorow for the second day of the Resource conference at Oxford University's Smith School. Coming up tomorrow are Bill Clinton, Jochen Zeitz, Sir Terry Leahy, David Milliband, Will Hutton and Lord Mandelson. I hope that today has been useful and if nothing else, we have learnt that an aircraft carrier does 12 inches to a gallon of fuel :)",,0.07437894692928254
167,article,commentisfree/2012/jul/10/romania-smallhold-farmers,Opinion,2012-07-10,Romania must not sell out traditional farmers to the biotech giants | Luke Dale-Harris,https://gu.com/p/39v8e,Opinion,Romania must not sell out traditional farmers to the biotech giants,Romania's smallholder farmers are being denied EU funding as ministers allow the encroachment of large-scale agribusiness,682,"Time in Romania seems to fold with the landscape. Where the hills of Transylvania rise from the Hungarian plains, life carries on as it has for centuries; farmers cultivate their small plots of land by hand while pigs, chickens and children roam unpaved village streets. However, where the land drops and the horizon opens up, history closes in and the reforms of the past 75 years, first under communism and then capitalism, become evident. Around villages sealed off by concrete blocks built under Ceausescu, the land stretches out in huge fields carrying single crops, occasionally punctuated by the slow crawl of a €500,000 combine harvester. With uncapped EU subsidies rewarding growth and productivity over all else, these farms are growing exponentially, swallowing all in their way. This, it seems, is the future of Romanian agriculture. Yet, where this model of farming might have worked in other countries, Romania, like many of its Balkan neighbours, is a different story. Despite the best efforts of Ceausescu to throw them off the land and the draw of new markets and employment opportunities since, around 30% of Romania's 19 million population continues to live off their subsistence and semi-subsistence farms. However, both Romanian government and policy makers in Brussels refuse to acknowledge that these are the people who prop up the Romanian economy, keep the culture alive and the environment diverse. Instead, officials are systematically undermining the infrastructure that the country relies on. By applying the widely condemned ""one size fits all' policy central to the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the vast majority of Romania's farmers are being cast to the sidelines. At present 51% of the €6bn yearly subsidies coming into Romania go to just 0.9% of farms, while a total of 70% of Romanian farms are considered ineligible for subsidies of any kind. The networks of trade that peasant farmers have traditionally relied on are being eroded on both ends. With the seed market largely monopolised by multinationals who drive the price up for seeds that won't reproduce and must be bought anew each year, farmers are often forced into spending unnecessarily. At the other end, local markets are dying under competition from foreign superstores, selling food at low prices that are only made affordable by subsidies and technology that the peasant farmers don't have. Today, an annual agribusiness conference is being held in Bucharest. It is the first such meeting under the new minister of agriculture, Daniel Consantin, the third person to hold the position this year. Smallholder farmers tentatively placed their hopes on Constantin, as he marks a break from the previous ministers, Valeriu Tabără and Stelian Fuia, both of whom had previously worked for controversial Biotech giant, Monsanto, and in favour both of further GMO cultivation and intensive farming. However, the conference, sponsored by Monsanto, Pioneer and DuPont, and attended by some of the country's largest landowners, promises to continue in the old vein, leaving power in the hands of private investors. Even the secretary of state for agriculture, Achim Irimescu, was unable to deny that the sponsors and attendants had political motives for funding the event, saying ""usually (these companies) have an interest in sponsoring these events for some kind of lobby purposes"". If the conference turns out as expected, it will be a demoralising sign for farmers and environmental NGOs who have been fighting for changes in the ministry of agriculture in the lead up to the CAP reforms in 2013. In order to both support its citizens and compete internationally on the food market, Romania needs to start to view its poor farmers as the building blocks on which it can create its future, rather than a persistent problem that needs to be phased out. Small farms are able to produce as much or more food as their large competitors, yet they are being killed off under the false promise of increasing yields and economic development. Until Romania focuses funds towards rural development and sustainable agriculture, it threatens its own culture, environment and the largest part of its population. • Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",,0.055680959252387835
168,article,commentisfree/2012/jun/13/california-gm-referendum-change-america-food,Opinion,2012-06-13,How California's GM food referendum may change what America eats | Richard Schiffman,https://gu.com/p/389e5,Opinion,How California's GM food referendum may change what America eats,"The vast majority of Americans want genetically modified food labelled. If California passes November's ballot, they could get it",1225,"Last month, nearly 1m signatures were delivered to county registrars throughout California calling for a referendum on the labeling of genetically engineered foods. If the measure, ""The Right to Know Genetically Engineered Food Act"", which will be on the ballot in November, passes, California will become the first state in the nation to require that GM foods be labeled as such on the package. This is not the first time that the issue has come up in California. Several labeling laws have been drafted there, but none has made it out of legislative committee. Lawmakers in states like Vermont and Connecticut have also proposed labeling legislation, which has gone nowhere in the face of stiff industry opposition. And the US Congress has likewise seen sporadic, unsuccessful attempts to mandate GM food labeling since 1999. What makes the referendum in California different is that, for the first time, voters and not politicians will be the ones to decide. And this has the food industry worried. Understandably so, since only one in four Americans is convinced that GMOs are ""basically safe"", according to a survey conducted by the Mellman Group, and a big majority wants food containing GMOs to be labeled. This is one of the few issues in America today that enjoys broad bipartisan support: 89% of Republicans and 90% of Democrats want genetically altered foods to be labeled, as they already are in 40 nations in Europe, in Brazil, and even in China. In 2007, then candidate Obama latched onto this popular issue saying that he would push for labeling – a promise the president has yet to keep. In Europe, only 5% of food sold contains GMOs, a figure that continues to shrink. In the US, by contrast, an estimated 70% of the products on supermarket shelves include at least traces of genetically engineered crops – mostly, corn and soy byproducts and canola oil, which are ingredients in many of America's processed foods. Given their unpopularity with consumers, labeling ""Frankenfoods"" would undoubtedly hurt sales, possibly even forcing supermarkets to take them off their shelves. In one survey, just over half of those polled said they would not buy food that they knew to be genetically modified. This makes the financial stakes for November's referendum vote huge. California is not just America's leading agricultural state, but the most populous state in the nation. If companies are made to change their labels in California, they may well do so all over the country, rather than maintain a costly two-tier packaging and distribution system. Several hurdles will have to be overcome, however, before this happens. The ballot initiative will face fierce opposition from the food and biotech industries, which are expected to spend an estimated $60-100m on an advertising blitz to convince Californians that labeling is unnecessary, will hurt farmers, increase their food prices, and even contribute to world hunger. One lobbyist the corporations have hired to make this case is Tom Hiltachk, the head of the Coalition Against the Costly Food Labeling Proposition (CACFLP), whose members include the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA), Monsanto, BASF, Bayer, Dow and Syngenta, as well as several big food processors and supermarket chains. Hiltachk is no stranger to the shadowy world of industry front groups, according to Alexis Baden-Mayer, political director of the Organic Consumers Association. The food activist reported on Alternet that: ""With a little help from his friends at Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds, he helped organize the Californians for Smokers' Rights group to fight anti-smoking initiatives in the 1980s and 1990s."" Also working to defeat the labeling initiative, according to Baden-Mayer, is the California Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse (CALA), which likewise receives big bucks from the tobacco industry and assorted other corporations. The consumer watchdog group Public Citizen says that CALA aims ""to incite public scorn for the civil justice system, juries and judges, and to pave the way for enactment of laws immunizing corporations from liability for actions that harm consumers."" Whether lobbying groups like these will be able to convince famously independent Californians to reject the labeling initiative in November remains to be seen. But even if the referendum passes, the food industry can be expected to challenge in court the state's right to mandate its own labeling requirements – a function usually reserved for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), at the federal level. The FDA's position on GMOs is that they are safe and essentially equivalent nutritionally to conventionally grown food varieties. But critics counter that the FDA has no way of knowing if this is true, since crucial testing of GM foods has never been required by the agency, and indeed, has not yet been conducted. Writes Dr Suzanne Wuerthele, a toxicologist with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): ""We are confronted with the most powerful technology the world has ever known, and it is being rapidly deployed with almost no thought whatsoever to its consequences."" The concern is that genetic modification alters the proteins in foods in ways that researchers do not yet fully understand. Substances that have never existed before in nature are entering our food supply untested. While researchers have not yet found a ""smoking gun"", which would prove that GM foods as a class are dangerous, there are troubling signs that they may be a factor in the recent epidemic of food allergies. Soon after GM soy was introduced to the UK, for example, soy allergies escalated by 50%. Rosa Rashall, a nutritionist in Garberville, California, who took part in the petition campaign to get the labeling initiative on the ballot, told the Redwood Times: ""We are all worried for a variety of reasons, from health effects to skyrocketing food sensitivities that have started to come about in the last 20 years. There has been an incredible 400% increase in food sensitivities that coincides pretty well with the unlabeled introduction of GMO food into the marketplace."" Critics also argue that agriculture's increasing dependence on GMOs has coincided with a steep rise in toxic agrochemical use over the last decade. A variety of GM corn sold by Monsanto was developed specifically to withstand punishing doses of the company's bestselling herbicide, Roundup. Food scientists remain divided on the larger food safety issue. Some say that there is no cause for alarm, while others cite the allergy problem and also animal studies, like one published by the International Journal of Biological Sciences, which showed high levels of kidney and liver failures (the two organs of detoxification) in rats that were fed Monsanto GM corn. Monsanto's biotech corn is designed to produce a pesticide in its cellular structure that wards off insect pests. Nobody knows what effect this toxin will have on the people who eat the flesh of livestock that are fed it. The bottom line is that we can't be sure what the physiological effects of consuming GM foods are until rigorous human trials are conducted – which is not likely to happen anytime soon. Californians aren't waiting until all of the scientific results are in. And what they decide at the polling station in November may change what the rest of us eat. • Editor's note: this article originally stated that California was the ""third most populous state"" in the US; in fact, it is the most populous (and third largest geographically); the article was amended at 12pm ET (5pm UK) on 13 June.",,0.11665616246498599

""He dropped these."" The cop thanked me, tossed the gojis in the trunk, and bustled away his captive amid a cacophony of outrage from the crowds. Moments earlier, the man with the berries had called out to the crowd: ""They can't arrest us all! Let's stand together!"" Moments later, poignantly, he was grabbed by the police and bundled into the squad car. It was a silly arrest, really. He wasn't doing anything at all. He was eating goji berries, standing on the edge of the road. Jaysnacking. A token flex of muscle from Fairfax County police. I'm not sure this constitutes a legal defence, but I'm pretty sure that if you're eating a bag of organic goji berries, you're probably not much of a threat to society. As the police pulled away, the bullhorn sirens started up and I walked away from the noise. There was a little too much testosterone on the sidewalk this afternoon – a few too many megaphones for my liking. But hey, you want to shout about the tyranny of a corrupt transnational banking oligarchy, you go right ahead. I'm not about to tell you to hush. It's horses for courses. Two years ago, a group of Spanish activists sat in silence on the beach and sent a white ring of positive energy up the hill to encircle and cleanse the Bilderberg hotel. Whatever gets the job done. As I left the crime scene, I met a member of Oathkeepers trotting down from their gazebo to check on the arrest. ""We'll be looking at the video evidence,"" he assures me, puffing past. The Oathkeepers are a posse of military veterans and retired police officers, who have come to keep an eye on things at Bilderberg 2012. They're an incredibly reassuring presence; tough, avuncular – darn it they just want to make you go up and shake them by the hand and say: ""Thank you, sir, for being here."" The aim of Oathkeepers is encourage anyone who has sworn to defend the constitution – so that's military, law enforcement officers, and first responders – to honour their oath. They're here at Bilderberg to keep a grizzled eye on things. ""We try to stay mission specific,"" says John Oetken, an Oathkeeper from Orange County – although at Bilderberg, their mission has crept a little to include overseeing not only the police, but also the protesters. ""We're a neutral party. We're here to make sure it's a peaceful process, and to keep the knuckleheads in line, from both sides."" I had breakfast this morning with three other veterans – retired Navy men – who have taken a road trip up from Florida to be here at Bilderberg… Dr Rick Davis is about the calmest person I've ever met. A former Flight Surgeon, he spent 9 years in the military, can fly an F16 and carried out missions with the Navy Seals. I ask him why he's come here. He takes his iPhone and shows me a quote from the anthropologist Margaret Mead: ""Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has."" Rick and his fellow veterans, Wayne Fritzsche and Bob Romanko, are about as far from whatever lazy caricature of 'Bilderberg activist' might exist in the mind of an idiot. Wayne is the chairman of a publicly traded pharmaceuticals company. ""I understand what having a full diary means – and let me tell you, the people who go to Bilderberg aren't going to block off three or four days just to have a 'chat'. They wouldn't give three or four days to a state visit. A couple of hours, dinner and you're done. Bilderberg is a co-ordinated effort on a huge scale"". But an effort to do what? Rick answers. ""At Bilderberg are the apex predators of the world crime syndicate. Now, I'm a physician. These people display all the classic symptoms of psychopathy. They exhibit an obsessive compulsion towards the exercise of power. These are extremely ill people, they have a culture of negativism and death. And I'm here to stop their agenda. It's the agenda that's killing us."" The risk is that great? Rick nods matter-of-factly. ""I'm a trauma physician – which is all about assessing risk. I have a considerable knowledge of nuclear, biological and chemical warfare. I'm CEO of a company, and in business you're always asking: where is my nearest risk? Risk assessment is my job. And right now, we're at risk from the biggest threat to humanity there's ever been."" These men feel a moral imperative to stand up and square off against the threat. As Bob says: ""I simply cannot do nothing."" A former Navy historian, Bob worked in sports radio and has the voice to match. His growls his frustration at the fact that his son, a journalist, can't get his head round the seriousness of the crisis. ""He's married a doctor, he's lives in a fabulous city, he's living the American dream. He just doesn't see that the American dream is heading off a cliff."" I ask Rick why he thinks that the 'first responders' to the threat, the activists outside the hotel gates, are so predominantly male. ""I've thought about this,"" he says. ""Men protect the clan. We're hard-wired to look outwards for a threat. Women are hard-wired to protect the family, the house. Men are looking at the horizon. What's coming down the road?"" A mile up the road at Bilderberg, the crowd has grown to around 500 people (a new Bilderberg record!) and I'd say well over 80% of them are men. One of them is Matthew Medina from We Are Change San Antonio – I ask him why there are so few women around him. ""Dang, dude, that's a good question,"" he says. ""It's heavy on the soul to protest against the global elite, about a superclass meeting in secret. But listen, women are paving the way in protesting against food laws and GMO, additives and fluoride. We all do our bit."" But at Bilderberg – it's the men. ""In a way, maybe this is our sports. This is our challenge – to make some noise and bring media attention to this event. Bilderberg is our football field."" Do you play any sports yourself? ""I breakdance. I used to be heavily into the underground hip hop scene – my crew was Public Zoo, out of Corpus Christi, Texas. It's still around, 10 years after I started it. B-Boy Spaceboy, that's me. Mainly I do tricks – I freeze. You want a see a freeze?"" He holds the pose, and snaps back to his feet, acknowledging the whoops. Oh yeah, B-Boy Spaceboy's still got it. But he no longer competes. ""These days I'm an electrician, I'm a blue collar guy, I work 40 hours a week, but what do they know about that?"" he says, jerking a thumb towards the security fence. ""And what do they care?"" He heads off to rejoin his We Are Changer buddies, who force this confession from a passing limo: ""Are you guys globalists? No? Oh… you're hairdressers."" If Bilderberg is our football field, where does this leave 'sports' in the life of the activist male? Collin Abramowicz is 22, and comes from a background soaked in sports: ""My stepfather watches baseball, my father watches football, all my friends are obsessed with sports. I used to do wrestling at school, but now my priorities have shifted. You cannot get passionate about something when you're being deceived. They're magicians – they are doing something with one hand while you're watching the other. Sport is a distraction."" From what? ""How about the NDAA? Or how about HR658? Why does the government want to put 30,000 surveillance drones in the sky by 2020?"" ""Look at the newspaper,"" says his friend Aaron Wolkind, ""it's half sports. Billions of dollars are poured into this stuff, ramming it into the public psyche. People's primal competitive urges are focused onto a false, superficial sports-reality. My friends who are still into sports, I can't relate to them any more. They channel all their passion and energy into something meaningless. And they know so much about it: all the statistics; who might or might not get drafted into which team. I've got friends who will literally fight over sports. Me? I'm passionate about the real world."" Noam Chomsky made exactly this point in a 1992 interview featured in Manufacturing Consent. Chomsky describes sports as: …another crucial example of the indoctrination system, in my view… it offers people something to pay attention to that's of no importance… And in fact it's striking to see the intelligence that's used by ordinary people in [discussions of] sports [as opposed to political and social issues]. I mean, you listen to radio stations where people call in -- they have the most exotic information and understanding about all kind of arcane issues. And the press undoubtedly does a lot with this. A study of Bilderberg's rich (in every sense) history chimes with a peculiarly male hunger for sports-facts. Daniel Kirby, 28, is one of the few Brits here, a history student from Chester. Daniel's got the hunger. ""If I read something, I have to find the source, to trace things back."" As for Bilderberg: ""This means looking at the interlocking directorships of the delegates, reading the think tank documents. Have you read 'Which Way to Persia?' from the Brookings Institute?"" I confess I haven't. ""It's a hugely complex subject, obviously, but let's just say – the road to Tehran goes through Damascus."" I mention that Bassma Kodmani, a senior member of the Syrian National Council, is at Bilderberg this year. Daniel gets out his notebook. ""I'll have to check that."" This is what I love about Bilderberg. Having conversations that can swerve from the Brookings Institute, to Hegelian dialectics, to Daniel asking me: ""Do you know the Olympic torch relay was invented by the Nazis?"" This sparks a quick five minute chat about Goebbels, propaganda and Edward Bernays. Once we're on the Nazis it's a short hop and a skip back to Bilderberg. Me: ""So, you know Prince Bernhard worked for IG Farben?"" Daniel: ""NW-7, their intelligence unit. And you know about Allen Dulles and the Nazi money?"" Me: ""Oh my God – Harriman, and the Bush family. It's incredible."" God I'll miss this place. I do slightly worry that I've become a Bilderberg nerd, reading transcripts of Henry Kissinger's phonecalls with David Rockefeller from the '70s, and knowing which Bilderbergers sit on the board of the Institute of International Finance – the body that represents the private holders of the Greek debt. I've started to plan holidays around international research archives. ""There's kind of a nerd aspect to the research,"" admits B-Boy Spaceboy. ""I come from a nerd background – I collect comic books. You know Jason Bermas, the documentary maker, he's a massive fan of The Simpsons. I'm more in The Amazing Spider-Man myself. We're like the guys from The Big Bang Theory. Like a lot of nerds, I've had to stand up to bullies. And that's what we're doing here."" Nerds versus bullies. That's a description of Bilderberg I haven't heard before, but a good one. Nerds and veterans. Liberty's best hope.",,0.07092602221996754
170,article,environment/blog/2012/may/04/gm-debate,Environment,2012-05-04,A chance to move the GM debate on  | Ian Sample,https://gu.com/p/37cx8,News,A chance to move the GM debate on,"It's hard to imagine campaigners and scientists will resolve their differences, but they must seize this opportunity for open dialogue",559,"Will something come of it after all? On Tuesday, crop scientists at one of Britain's leading agricultural centres pleaded with anti-GM campaigners to call off plans to trash a field trial of GM wheat. They invited the protesters to discuss the work instead. In response, the campaigners proposed an open debate where both sides could air their views in public. To this, the researchers have agreed. The time and venue are now being worked out. The dialogue between scientists who work on GM crops and anti-GM groups has rarely been a productive one. Many scientists give talks about their work, and host open days where the public can stroll around their labs and hear the science explained. But campaigners argue that their concerns are brushed aside, either by the scientists themselves, or by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, or its advisory committee on releases to the environment, which assesses the risks of GMO trials in the UK. No surprise then that many campaigners don't trust the scientists or have faith in the system's impartiality. The scientists wrote to the campaign group Take the Flour Back - and recorded a video appeal - after the group declared a day of mass action to destroy the wheat plots at Rothamsted Research in Hertfordshire. The wheat carries a gene that produces what is called an aphid alarm pheromone. Known as E-beta-farnesene or EBF, the odour is released by aphids under attack as a warning that makes others flee. But more than 400 plants have evolved to produce the odour naturally, including peppermint. The wheat plants have other genes inserted into them. One is an antibiotic marker, used to select the modified plants in the lab. And some carry a further gene that produces the chemicals the plant needs to make the pheromone. That boosts the level of aphid repellant the plant releases roughly fivefold. The thinking behind the crop is that in making the aphid-repelling odor, it will thrive without being sprayed with so much insecticide. That is an open question, and one that can be answered by these kinds of trials. In one previous study, researchers in Germany modified arabidopsis plants with the same aphid-repelling gene. In lab tests it had no effect on aphid attacks, but the plants were never tested in the open air. Campaigners at Take the Flour Back replied to the scientists' appeal within hours. They argued that pollen from the GM wheat could spread unwanted genes into conventional wheat and threaten the future livelihoods of the farming community. To protect against this, the modified crop is surrounded by a barrier of barley and conventional wheat that will be destroyed at the end of the trial. The campaigners go on to challenge the scientists on other issues, from the future commercialisation of the crop to its unpredictable impacts on non-target species. In the latest exchange on Thursday, Prof John Pickett, Rothamsted's head of chemical ecology, emailed the campaigners to agree to the public debate and open a discussion about venues and hosts. The points the campaigners raised in their letter look set to form the backbone of the debate. Will the two sides resolve their differences? That is hard to imagine. But there's an opportunity here to move the GM debate on, and the onus is on these scientists and campaigners to seize it.",,0.02468487394957984
171,article,environment/2012/mar/12/californian-campaign-labelling-gm-food,Environment,2012-03-12,Californian campaign pushes for labelling of GM food,https://gu.com/p/365hd,News,Californian campaign pushes for labelling of GM food,Momentum gathers for ballot initiative that hopes to force labelling of genetically-modified ingredients – and could prompt a nationwide change in the US,1312,"In a column last month, New York Times food writer Mark Bittman wondered, ""Why Aren't GMO Foods Labeled?"" After laying out some of the basic arguments in favor of labeling — most obviously, the contradiction between the USDA finding that genetically modified foods aren't ""materially different"" from non-modified foods and yet its prohibition of including GMOs within the legal definition of organic — Bittman concluded that major food companies' unwillingness to label foods containing genetically modified organisms is ""demeaning and undemocratic."" An overwhelming majority of Americans say they want to know if the food they're buying contains GMOs. The food processors' resistance to providing that information, Bittman argued, violates the ideals of transparency that the free market is supposed to rest on. It looks like Bittman might get his wish. A coalition of NGOs and family farmers is working to put a proposition on California's November ballot that would require food companies that sell in the state to put labels on their products declaring whether they are ""produced with genetic engineering."" If approved by voters, the California proposition (which you can read here) would have a national ripple effect, just as the state's air rules have influenced the cars that get made in Detroit. The sheer size of the California market likely would prevent most food companies from segmenting products sold in the Golden State from those sold elsewhere; food producers would probably have to put the labels on all their products sold nationwide. For organic food advocates, GMO labeling has been a long sought goal. ""This has been a dream of many of us in the anti-GMO movement for over a decade,"" says Ronnie Cummins, executive director of the Organic Consumers Association. ""We realized long ago that the federal government was not going to move on the issue. Passing a mandatory labeling law in California will have the impact of a national law, because California is the most important state in the union."" In 2002, citizens in Oregon put a measure on the ballot that would have required GMO labeling. Massive spending by major food companies and the grocery lobby trounced the proposition. Then, in 2004, voters in California's Mendocino County approved a measure banning the cultivation of genetically engineered crops there. Other California counties —Santa Cruz, Marin, and Trinity — soon followed. But in recent years there's been something of a lull in national activism against GMOs, which critics say threaten biodiversity, increase corporate control of the food system, and could pose health risks to animals and people. Most of the sustainable food activism these days focuses on building alternatives to the industrial food system. Just look at young people's enthusiasm for becoming farmers, the surge in artisanal foods, and the continued growth in the number of farmers markets and CSAs. Because the USDA's definition of organic explicitly prohibits GMOs, many ag-tivists figured they could focus on building a sustainable food system parallel to the dominant industrial one and not have to worry too much about GMOs. Recent developments have reawakened organic farmers and their supporters to the threat posed by GMOs. In October, the FDA completed a review of a super-fast growing GMO salmon, a crucial step toward approving the fish for market. AquaBounty Technologies' ""AquaAdvantage salmon"" would be the world's first genetically engineered fish for human consumption. Also last fall, seed and chemical conglomerate Monsanto began selling to farmers a variety of genetically modified sweet corn. The sweet corn, which should hit supermarkets this summer, is the first genetically modified vegetable eaten directly by people. (The huge amounts of GMO canola, corn, and soy grown in the US are either fed to animals or go into processed foods.) Then, in January, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced that his agency would allow the unrestricted cultivation of GE alfalfa. Vilsack's decision marked a major defeat for companies like Whole Foods, Organic Valley, and Stoneyfield Yogurt that had fought hard for a ban against GE alfalfa. Dairy producers and sellers are especially worried about GE alfalfa because of how easily alfalfa seeds cross-pollinate. If — or, more accurately, when — GE alfalfa cross breeds with organic alfalfa, it will make it difficult, if not impossible, for dairy farmers to find organic feed for their cows. The integrity of the entire organic milk sector is at risk. That's worrisome to retailers like Whole Foods, who know that organic milk often serves as a kind of ""gateway drug for organics"" as new parents look for organics to feed their kids. These threats have combined to get the attention of wealthy progressive who are funding the effort to collect the 800,000 signatures needed to get the GMO labeling initiative on the California ballot. Prominent organic growers have also signed onto the effort. The California Right to Know campaign is co-chaired by Grant Lundberg of the organic rice growers and processors Lundberg Family Farm. In a oped published recently in the Sacramento Bee, Grant Lundberg put the case simply: ""Would you want to know if the food you are buying, eating and feeding to your children has been genetically engineered?"" Lawmakers in other states have started to push legislation modeled on the California initiative. Legislators in Connecticut and Vermont are considering bills that would require labeling of genetically engineering foods. A state senator in Washington pushed a similar measure. In Hawaii — a popular spot for GM crop testing, because of its tropical climate — grassroots groups are pushing a disclosure law. The GMO seed companies, the major food processors, and the grocery store chains are getting ready to fight back. A Sacramento-based lobbyist is preparing to launch a political committee — the Coalition Against the Costly Food Labeling Proposition — to fight the measure. That's the exact same name the industry used to fight the Oregon measure 10 years ago. Big Food is scared for good reason. The Grocery Manufacturers Associations says that about 75 percent of processed foods found at the supermarket contain GMOs. But, according to an NPR/ThomponReuters poll taken in 2010, 90 percent of Americans say that food labels should say whether the product contains GMOs. (Can you think of anything else that Americans agree on in numbers like that? Even puppies aren't as popular.) Once consumers have additional information about food containing GMOs, they will likely start shifting their purchasing habits. The NPR poll showed that just four-in-ten people would feel OK eating genetically modified meat. The situation in Europe offers a glimpse of how food markets would be affected. Under EU law, foods containing GMOs must be labeled. The amount of land planted in GM crops is a fraction of what it is in the US — and shrinking. If passed, the California proposition would be a massive blow to the ill-defined ""natural food"" sector. Unlike products that are organic certified, there is no official definition for ""natural."" The California law would change that and prevent companies from using the marketing tag ""natural"" on products containing GMOs. ""Once you have labeling like the EU and 22 other nations, consumers will be able to tell if it has GMO ingredients and they won't be able to be hoodwinked anymore by foods that claim to be natural, but aren't natural at all,"" Cummins says. ""The $50 billion natural food sector will shrink and the $30 billion organic food sector will increase."" Major companies like Kellogg's that have made investments in ""natural food"" brands will have to either drop the ""natural"" label — and lose sales — or find a way to source non-GMO or organic grains and oils. In the long run, the amount of land planted in organic crops should grow. ""Consumers see the [GMO] labels, consumers complain to the grocery stores, the grocery stores complain to the food processors, and the food processors start asking the farmers to grow something different,"" Cummins says. ""It's a chain reaction that we are sure is going to happen — and it all rides on California.""",,0.17385650064221486
172,article,sustainable-business/sustainability-with-john-elkington/investors-longterm-sustainable-finance,Guardian Sustainable Business,2012-02-29,"""Your grandchildren have no value""",https://gu.com/p/35zgj,,"""Your grandchildren have no value""",John Elkington focuses on the thinking of financial analyst Jeremy Grantham as he warns that investors ignore the long-term at their descendants peril,1050,"Most business people who struggle to get their brains around long-term sustainability find it easier to grasp if they think about their children or grandchildren. Indeed, several CEOs I have worked with have pointed to their children as a key reason why they switched on to the agenda, one or two because they were beaten up (verbally, they say) at the family breakfast table. But the capitalist system thinks otherwise. In fact my title is a direct quote from a hard-hitting quarterly investor letter released a few days ago by financial analyst Jeremy Grantham. His message is that if we proceed on current capitalist lines, ""the planet's goose is cooked."" For those who haven't come across Grantham, and I covered an earlier letter in this series last year, he is perhaps the most interesting financial analyst worldwide. He was a co-founder of GMO back in 1977, a firm that now employs more than 500 people and at the end of last year managed $97bn in client assets. Grantham is known for his trenchant views on long-term ""value"" investing. The idea: whatever the market may say, there are fundamental valuations of businesses that are ignored at the investor's peril. If you want to make long-term returns, he says, remember that ""all bubbles burst, all investment frenzies pass away. You absolutely must ignore the vested interests of the [financial] industry and the inevitable cheerleaders who will assure you that this time it's a new high plateau or a permanently high level of productivity, even if that view comes from the Federal Reserve itself."" Then he corrects himself, adding: ""No. Make that especially if it comes from there."" The point is that ""the market is gloriously inefficient and wanders far from fair price but eventually, after breaking your heart and your patience (and, for professionals, those of their clients too), it will go back to fair value. Your task,"" he advises would-be long-term investors, ""is to survive until that happens."" GMO assumes that whatever the market thinks today, ""profit margins and price earnings ratios will move back to the long-term average in seven years."" Grantham calls for foresight, patience and a reining in of analysts' natural optimism – noting that ""successful people are probably more optimistic than average."" This can lead to irrational exuberance, a problem compounded by the fact that for most financial analysts there is an irresistible temptation to over-manage, driven by the need ""to be seen to be busy, to be earning your keep."" On a train back to Geneva last week, I finished Robert Harris' latest novel The Fear Index, set in the area, and came across an extraordinary angle on the latest financial crash. In 1993, Harris notes on page 240, the US shut down its version of the Superconducting Super Collider, saving the country's taxpayers some $10bn. Finding little work available at Europe's equivalent, CERN's Large-Hadron Collider, many physicists went off to Wall Street and became ""quants"". There, he recalls, ""they helped build derivatives rather than particle accelerators. And when that went wrong and the banking system imploded, Congress had to rescue it, at a cost to the US taxpayer of $3.7trn."" Another example, one of the book's characters observes, of the Law of Unintended Consequences. The problem with most of today's variants of capitalism is that they produce unintended consequences on a planetary scale. They ignore key externalities (particularly things like species loss and climate change), assuming that growth can continue almost indefinitely. Worse, Grantham warns, some of the most damaging forms of capitalism, and some of the worst industries, have the money to buy influence, a lot of it. ""Today's version of US capitalism has died and gone to heaven on this issue,"" Grantham warns. ""A company is now free to spend money to influence political outcomes and need tell no one, least of all its own shareholders, the technical owners."" And, grotesquely, some parts of the industrial complex fight ""to increase the inherent weaknesses of capitalism,"" aggravating its blind-spots and its addiction to unsustainable forms of growth. One of the worst aspects of current US politics is the growing disinterest in – even active denigration of – science. In China, Grantham reports, eight out of nine senior leaders are scientists, whereas in the US perhaps 2-3 out of 535 members of Congress and the President and Vice-President would qualify. Whatever the absolute numbers, it's an almost unbelievable fact that ""about 100 Congressmen do not believe in evolution."" In terms of the proportion of science degrees awarded, the US ranks 60th place in the ranking of countries. Worse, Grantham notes, this growing scientific weakness is happening in a country ""where everyone loves to hear the good news."" So what is the bad news all those science-averse optimists are choosing to ignore? Capitalism's fixation with narrowly defined growth, Grantham says, ""by ignoring the finite nature of resources and by neglecting the long-term well-being of the planet and its potentially crucial biodiversity, threatens our existence."" He stresses that ""fifty and one-hundred-year horizons are important, despite the 'tyranny of the discount rate,' and grandchildren do have value."" His final couple of lines: ""My conclusion is that capitalism does admittedly do a thousand things better than other systems: it only currently fails in two or three. Unfortunately, for us all, even a single one of these failings may bring capitalism down, and us with it."" In The Fear Index, Harris shows what can happen when we engineer financial systems with a built-in drive to maximise financial returns at virtually any cost. Without wishing to give a way the plot, the system compromises the global economy. Perhaps Harris can turn his attention next to what happens when we compromise the global biosphere – perhaps tracking the exploits of a a heroic individual who invests on the assumption that our species will do the wrong thing up the last moment – and often beyond?

To help your comfortable re-entry here's a digest of the environment news you may have missed. Oil spills: Shell accepted full liability for two massive oil spills in 2008 that devastated a Nigerian community and faces a bill of faces a bill of hundreds of millions of dollars. A day later, a UN report blamed Shell and others for decades of pollution in the Niger delta, which it said would take $1bn and 30 years to clean up. Shell was also behind the worst spill in the North Sea for a decade. Energy: The Fukushima disaster claimed a victim in the UK, with the closure of the Mox nuclear fuel plant at Sellafield and the loss of 600 jobs and £1.4bn of taxpayer investment. In the US, it was revealed that farmers are growing the first corn plants genetically modified for the specific purpose of putting more ethanol in gas tanks rather than producing more food. But criticism of corn biofuel subsidies has left corn-belt farmers saying: ""The country has turned on us"". China and Wikileaks cables: China has ""vastly increased"" the risk of a nuclear accident by opting for cheap technology, according to diplomatic cables from the US embassy in Beijing. Other cables indicated China has not measured the most dangerous types of air pollution because it is afraid of the political consequences and that a US diplomat posed as a tourist to investigate a notorious tiger breeding centre, where he saw animals whipped and made to perform ""marriage processions"". Australia's carbon tax: The row rumbled on with hundreds of truckers - dubbed truckwits by opponents - circled Australia's parliament in a campaign aimed at forcing the government to withdraw the proposed tax and call a new election. Rows: Al Gore likened winning the argument with climate change sceptics to that of winning the argument with racists who opposed the US civil rights movement. The data at the heart of the so-called Climategate controversy was released by the University of East Anglia's Climatic Reseearch Unit. It comprises temperature records going back 150 years from 5113 weather stations around the world. An embarrassing row blighted an international meeting on wildlife conservation in Geneva, when NGOs were excluded from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species gathering. Geoengineering: A giant pipe and balloon, simulating a volcano is to be tested, as a method of injecting particles into the stratosphere and cool the planet. George Monbiot dismissed the idea as atmospheric liposuction. Of course, I may very well have missed a story or two. If so, please add it in the comments below.",,0.08797061524334253
174,article,sustainable-business/sustainability-with-john-elkington/economic-crisis-paradigm-shift-business-economic-models,Guardian Sustainable Business,2011-08-10,Wake up and smell the scorched phoenix feathers,https://gu.com/p/3x5na,,Wake up and smell the scorched phoenix feathers,• The Phoenix Economy report argued that the economic crisis offered a rare opportunity to reboot our economic and business models<br />• Now the smell of scorched feathers is everywhere,1003,"One of the most unpleasant smells I know is that of burning feathers – and smouldering Phoenix feathers don't smell much better. Let me explain. Over two years ago, I was one of the authors of The Phoenix Economy, a report arguing that the then-still-accelerating economic crisis offered a rare opportunity to reboot our economic and business models. We focused on social innovation, spotlighting 50 pioneers in the field – including start-ups, multinational corporations, investment houses and public agencies. And one of the 50 was the Obama presidency, which we saw as modelling some of the new forms of leadership necessary to launch a more socially just, environmentally sustainable phoenix economy. Yes, well. What we didn't explore in sufficient detail was the political system of which the new administration was destined to be part – though I do recall coming back from Washington DC, a while later and saying that it felt like an undeclared civil war had broken out over there. Then came the Tea Party. And, now, after a bunch of other things, the Standard &amp; Poor's downgrade. Who would have believed that a couple of years back? And, all around, the growing risk that, like a supersaturated solution, all the global economy needs is for the wrong sort of seed crystal to be tossed in and the whole thing will set solid. A phase change, I think they called it in school chemistry. We argued for a very different sort of phase change back in 2009, to help the developed nations begin the long, hard but potentially immensely rewarding transition to radically more resource-efficient technologies, industries and lifestyles. We expected to see a stronger sense of political direction. Instead, we have seen a ballet of political jellyfish. We were probably spot-on with one comment about system change, however. Early-on in the report we argued: ""The thing about paradigms is that they persist for what seems like an eternity – and then turn inside-out in what seems disconcertingly like an instant."" Could that be what we are seeing now? Increasingly, I think so. But not just because of what is – or is not – happening in places like Washington, Brussels and Berlin. Having been exposed to the thinking of economists like Nikolai Kondratiev and Joseph Schumpeter at an impressionable age, I have long been fascinated by the long cycle economics, by the deep-seated processes of change that can take generations to crank through. And so a carillon of bells went off in my head when I read Jeremy Grantham's thinking on all of this. He is chief investment strategist of Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo (GMO), a Boston-based asset management firm. His first-quarter letter to investors, in April, was entitled Time to Wake Up: Days of Abundant Resources and Falling Prices Are Over Forever. And the second-quarter's follow-up was called Resource Limitations 2: Separating the Dangerous from the Merely Serious. They are well worth reading. In the first letter, Grantham concluded that we are seeing probably the most important paradigm shift since the Industrial Revolution. The rise in oil prices, he argues, almost certainly presages similar rises in a growing number of other natural resources. Then, in the second letter, he set out to distinguish those resource constraints that will be merely a drag on developed economies, and those that will pose an existential threat to our species. His conclusion that capitalism ""does not address these very long-term issues easily or well"" aligns powerfully with the theme of a new report we are putting together this month. He continues, ""capitalism's effectiveness moves along the spectrum of time horizons, brilliant at the short end but lost, irrelevant, and even plain dangerous at the very long end."" In terms of the hierarchy of future resource constraints, he argues that energy will be the greatest short- to medium-term menace, though over a 50-year time-horizon he is quite bullish for the alternatives to fossil fuels. Metals will be a growing headache over time. But the biggest problems, he thinks, will be in agriculture, with growing challenges around water, fertilisers and, the ultimate farming resource, soils. He sees current economic discount rates will as driving agricultural soils way beyond sustainable limits. Although he is encouraged by the potential of no-till farming, which radically cuts soil erosion, he sees the prevailing trends as headed in totally the wrong directions. He flags meat consumption and grain-based biofuels as two sectors that will massively impacted. His final paragraph, however, encourages us to become farmers, not bankers. Or, he quickly adds, resource efficiency experts who work to save at least some of these resources for our grandchildren. The upside of all this is that, ""farming will be a satisfying and enriching experience if, on a global basis, we rise to the long-term agricultural challenges"". And the downside he ultimately fears? Well, the smell of a few scorched phoenix feathers will be as nothing to the smell of a civilization going belly up. ""If good old short-term profit maximising continues as it did for the Syrian, Green, and Roman farmers before us, then at least today's farm owners will go down with the ship, travelling in first class."" My attention span in school chemistry was pretty limited: if it smelled, exploded or set solid in an instant, I remembered it, but formulae and valences went by with the wind. History, however, was a different matter. And one of my favourites was Arnold Toynbee, whose massive A Study of History assured my young mind that ""civilizations die from suicide, not murder"". That's fine, I thought, who would be stupid enough to bring an entire civilisation crashing down? But as I watch the shenanigans in Washington and closer to home, the smell of scorched feathers seems to be everywhere.

176,article,science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/may/19/1,Science,2011-05-19,The danger of science denial | GrrlScientist,https://gu.com/p/2p7dd,News,The danger of science denial,"Vaccine-autism claims, GMO ""Frankenfood"" bans, the herbal cure craze: All point to the public's growing fear (and, often, outright denial) of science and reason, says Michael Specter, a trend that spells disaster for human progress",402,"""Everyone's entitled to their opinion, they're even entitled to their opinion about progress,"" says journalist Michael Specter. ""But ... you're not entitled to your own facts."" Why is there such a tremendous epidemic of denialism? The main reason is due to our lack of understanding of correlation versus causation. Another is our loss of faith in authority and our mistrust of big government, big corporations and ""Big Pharma"" (so we then leap into the open arms of big placebo). ""Be skeptical. Ask questions. Demand proof. Demand evidence. Don't take anything for granted,"" remarks Mr Specter. ""But here's the thing: when you get proof, you need to accept the proof. And we're not that good at doing that. ...We're now in an epidemic of fear like one that I've never seen and hope never to see again."" Unfortunately, this fear is motivating people to replace science with a belief in magic, from seemingly harmless magic such as Ginkgo biloba, echinacia, and açaí, to tragic magic such as using coffee enemas to cure cancer, or even insisting that beet root can cure HIV. People fight genetically engineered food, and think it's wrong to patent life and crop seeds -- and they blame science for these problems. But these issues are about law, morality and corporate greed, not science. ""Science is not a company, it's not a country, it's not even an idea. It's a process,"" Mr Specter points out. ""[T]he idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we're afraid is really very deadening, and it's preventing millions of people from prospering."" The solution? Mr Specter mentions that we should fix the system instead of stopping scientific progress. This interesting presentation explores how denialism impacts humanity with avoidable tragedies: Even though denialism is a topic that desperately needs to be addressed, and Michael Specter clearly has the passion to advocate on behalf of science, he does not present workable solutions for most of the problems that he describes. I think people are more likely to listen to him if he mentions even one such solution. What are your thoughts? Michael Specter is a staff writer for The New Yorker. He wrote the book, Denialism: How Irrational Thinking Hinders Scientific Progress, Harms the Planet and Threatens Our Lives [Amazon UK; Amazon US], which asks why we have increasingly begun to fear scientific advances instead of embracing them. . email: grrlscientist@gmail.com twitter: @GrrlScientist",,0.051917613636363644

We need more philanthropists – drug companies, banks, mobile phone, mineral companies,"" he said. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates foundation, now with assets of around $22bn, has invested mostly in child health but Gates said one of the next great challenges would be to improve the productivity of poor farmers as world populations grow and climate change affects more people. ""Over 75% of the poor are farmers. If we can help them be more productive … we can help them but also deal with world food challenges. We see that with world food prices. We can help [them] more than double output. African output is one-third of that in the US,"" he said. The foundation has been criticised for spending on controversial GM technologies and on large-scale farming rather than supporting small-scale sustainable farming, but Gates said that increasing productivity was ""very pro-environment"". ""We invest in any technology that avoids starvation. We have said yes to [some GMO] groups in Africa. Most [of our investment] is in conventional breeding."" Gates told the MEPs he expected improvements in vaccines to halve the number of children who die before the age of five in the next 15 years. ""Fifteen years ago, I saw the health issue made the biggest difference. If you improve the health of a family, then parents choose voluntarily to have less children. Health improvements help with environment, food and jobs. These investments have had dramatic effects. What is incredible is that all the things that kill children are vaccine-preventable.

Stapleton for reasons 1.4. (b) &amp; (d) . 1. (SBU) Introduction and Summary: The Nicolas Sarkozy who arrives in Washington November 6 is in robust political health. He completely dominates the politics of France. All the levers of institutional power in a highly centralized state are at his disposal. He remains committed to a revitalization of France, through a reform of policies and laws that have acted as a break on French economic growth. The challenge now is to put his ideas and programs into effect. Off to a quick start this summer, with the implementation of a first series of reform measures, Sarkozy is now beginning to feel the full force of French resistance to change. His public support as reflected in the polls is high, but has slipped of late. The political impact of the first direct challenge, last week's national transportation strike, is not yet clear, but strikes in other sectors are threatening, raising the possibility of the kind of crisis atmosphere Sarkozy had hoped to avoid, given his electoral mandate and professed openness to dialogue. The image of a well-oiled, disciplined machine has suffered, as Sarkozy has repeatedly rebuked members of his team, including his own Prime Minister, raising questions about a thin-skinned and authoritarian personal style. The concentration of power and decision-making in the Presidency has made for uneven decision-making and follow-through. The prospect of slower domestic and international economic growth and a tight GOF budget have narrowed his room for maneuver. His appointment to the cabinet of women and minority representatives and the more populist style of his Presidency have been well-received, but his omnipresence and hyper-activity risk overexposure and Sarkozy-fatigue. Finally, freshly divorced from Cecilia, he is deprived of someone who (by his own account) was crucial to his personal equilibrium and served as a valued political sounding board. 2. (SBU) While not central to his Presidential campaign, Sarkozy has quickly asserted French leadership in Europe and staked out new positions and a role for France on the most pressing international issues. He believes that a relationship of trust and close cooperation with the U.S. enhances France's ability to make an impact -- toward the achievement of what are in most cases common objectives. After five months in office he (and his foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner) have begun to make their mark. They have overseen a dramatic shift in French policy on Iraq, reversed declining French support in Afghanistan, have set in motion a possible ""return"" to NATO, toughened France's approach to Iran and also Russia, and promised a new one toward Africa. The top foreign policy issue for Sarkozy is the environment, which he has embraced as a headline issue, linking foreign and domestic policy. Sarkozy and Kouchner also assign priority to Kosovo, Lebanon, and Darfur. Sarkozy's decision to assist the Dutch in Afghanistan is the latest illustration of a willingness to push a cautious bureaucracy and military and to break the mold of Chirac-era policy. Despite, and perhaps because of, convergence with the U.S. on key issues, and the dramatic improvement in the tone of the relationship, Sarkozy has identified specific areas of disagreement with the U.S. 3. (C) We continue to believe that Sarkozy represents an important opportunity. Energetic, in full command at home, he is determined to make a mark on the international scene. As distinct from Chirac, who advocated multi-polar containment of U.S. hegemony, Sarkozy is well-disposed personally to the U.S. He wants close policy cooperation with us, but in a relationship that gives France its full due as an independent player. ""Alliance, not alignment"" is the way he usually puts it, although he is not beyond striking a more defiant pose, as recently in Moscow, when he stated publicly that he would not be a ""vassal"" of the U.S. He will also continue to highlight differences on selected issues -- PARIS 00004357 002 OF 011 such as the environment, GMOs and Turkey's relationship with Europe -- as demonstrations of France's independent policy course. His emphasis of French independence makes less controversial at home both the warming up of the bilateral relationship and the bold policy decisions in such areas as Iraq, NATO, and Afghanistan. A distinct French approach, supportive on many issues, but not in lock-step, is in our interest. A partner with the international bone fides that France retains, as a leading European power close to but proudly independent of the U.S., is one that can enlarge our ability to effect positive outcomes internationally. 4. (U) In addition to setting the scene for Sarkozy's first official visit to Washington, this message iterates the state of play in a long list of issues where opportunities and challenges abound in U.S.-France relations. End Summary PART ONE: SARKOZY FIVE MONTHS INTO HIS PRESIDENCY 5. (SBU) Nicolas Sarkozy's visit to Washington follows an exceptionally long ""state of grace"" (as the French call a political honeymoon), one that only began to peter out in October, the fifth month of Sarkozy's Presidency. Through the summer and well into the new French political year that begins in September, Sarkozy seemed incapable of a political misstep. His poll ratings set records both vertically (level) and horizontally (durability). For a politician long attacked as an extremist and a divider, this was no small feat. 6. (SBU) Sarkozy's success is attributable to several factors. While Candidate Sarkozy ran a hard right election campaign geared to winning over the 15-20 percent of the votes that Jean-Marie LePen's National Front had captured in recent years, President Sarkozy quickly made clear he wanted to be a President of all the French, not just the political right. He also made clear that his ambition would not be satisfied with his election to the Presidency. He was determined to use the office to get France moving again -- unleashing its economic potential, allowing it to surmount long-term budgetary, financial and social challenges. He would do this by making good on his program of concrete reform measures, which had received a mandate from the French electorate. 7. (SBU) Immediately after his election in May, Sarkozy embarked on a policy of inclusiveness (""ouverture""), bringing in leading figures of the opposition, including the Socialist Party (such as Foreign Minister Kouchner), the non-Gaullist center-right, and civil society. In addition, he shattered the white-male cast of previous French governments with his appointments of women and minorities, including to key ministries. On the strength of his electoral mandate, and with this inclusiveness as cover, Sarkozy moved swiftly, and with virtually no Socialist opposition, to implement his reform program, moving five major pieces of legislation through Parliament by early October. Sarkozy seemed well on his way to proving that France could embrace change, and that he could imprint on it the ""culture of results"" that would be the basis for less painful, self-renewing change in the future. 8. (SBU) Over the past few weeks, shadows have entered this unnaturally bright picture. Current polling suggests that while support for Sarkozy remains at historically high levels (in the low 60's, depending on the poll), there has been a slow erosion in his standing, which has perhaps accelerated in the past few weeks. In the first serious push-back against a key reform, French public transport unions engaged in a country-wide strike on October 18 over the generous pensions available to public transport workers. Sarkozy PARIS 00004357 003 OF 011 insists that this time unions will not be able to scuttle this or any other part of the government's reform program -- while continuing to stress the need for dialogue, not government fiat, as the mode of action. However, international economic uncertainty affords Sarkozy far less room for maneuver as he seeks to reduce both government expenditures and taxes to unleash economic activity, while not fatally exacerbating France's already alarming debt situation. 9. (SBU) Sarkozy's unexpected willingness to compromise on several of his reform measures may signal recognition of the hard economic realities. However, he risks diminishing this image of determination and command -- key components of his political success thus far. Sarkozy appeared critical of both his Finance Minister and his Prime Minister in turn when the former called for ""greater rigor"" in state spending and the latter described the state as ""bankrupt"" in parliamentary hearings. Sarkozy, fearing that alarmist pronouncements could undermine the public's confidence, risks creating an impression of friction and hesitation at the top. Sarkozy's close personal association with policy reform has reduced his ability to cast aside the Prime Minister or other officials should his policies lose public support. 10. (SBU) The transport unions are but one of the constituencies Sarkozy will offend in shaking the French economy loose from policies that have held back growth and bloated public spending. As he pushes for reforms that make it easier to fire workers, shrink the size of the state (whose spending represents 52 percent of GDP) by cutting the civil service, and open up retail markets to more competition, he can expect further pushback from well-entrenched constituencies. Sarkozy has set in motion a series of negotiations on these issues that ultimately could lead to important systemic change. But the real impact will only become clear once the negotiations conclude -- probably in early 2008 -- and the government is forced to make politically difficult decisions. 11. (SBU) France's broader economic environment will not make the reform process any easier. Having promised the electorate measures that would bring an extra percentage point of growth to the economy, the Sarkozy government finds itself at a delicate point in the business cycle. The government has already scaled back earlier 2007 growth estimates, and most private sector economists believe the government's 2008 estimates are inflated. Although the fiscal stimulus from tax cuts passed this summer may give the president a short-term boost, he is unlikely to enjoy the political benefit of a strong growth environment in which to pursue his supply-side reforms. He has also promised the French people increased purchasing power, which will be hard to achieve. Some of this he blames on the strength of the dollar. 12. (SBU) Sarkozy is keen on unleashing market forces to reinvigorate the French economy, but he is less than laissez-faire when it comes to restructuring French industry. The French state owns a far smaller share of the economy than was once the case, but it still has effective control of energy and other key sectors. Sarkozy's industrial policy seems to be based on facilitating the emergence of key French firms as leaders in their industries in Europe and globally. While European experience with national champions industrial policies is shaky, the French have done comparatively well of late. Sarkozy does not hesitate to reduce state ownership in these deals. The merger of Gaz de France with Suez creates a European giant in gas and energy but also reduces the French stake in its gas company from 80 percent to 30 percent. 13. (SBU) At the macroeconomic level, Sarkozy has been highly critical of the European Central Bank's tight money, strong Euro policy and he is all but ignoring previously PARIS 00004357 004 OF 011 agreed Eurozone commitments to brining budgets back into balance. In both cases, Eurozone partners have little recourse and France can ride for free on the budget discipline of its partners, at least for a while. In the meantime, the President's approach plays well at home, and often appears designed for domestic consumption. 14. (SBU) The U.S.-French economic relationship remains robust, with over $1 billion in commercial transactions per day taking place between the two countries' firms. During President Sarkozy's visit, CEOs from some of the most important of these will meet, for the first time in several years as the French-American Business Council (FABC) to exchange views on policy priorities. U.S. firms have been almost unanimously positive about the Sarkozy government. Nonetheless there are a number of regulatory unknowns that could potentially impact U.S. commercial interests. Among these are the GOF's evolving views on genetically-modified organisms, IPR in the digital environment and pricing policy as it relates to pharmaceutical spending. 15. (C) On permanent overdrive and intense in the best of times, Sarkozy's recent divorce raises questions about his ability to maintain his equilibrium and focus. Sarkozy has himself spoken of his dependence on Cecilia -- ""my source of strength and my Achilles Heel,"" as he put it. During their separation in 2005, a highly irritable, darker Sarkozy came into view -- the same one that reappeared at the Lisbon Summit the day after the announcement of the divorce. How much Cecilia really anchored him, personally and politically, should soon become evident, but we are betting on Sarkozy's ability to bounce back. 16. (C) Notwithstanding the debate swirling around him and his slight decline in the polls, Sarkozy's political health remains strong. He controls all the main levers of power: the Presidency, the Parliament, the dominant political party, and the omnipresent agents of the French state. The opposition Socialists are in disarray, incapable for the moment of taking unified policy positions. Sarkozy is in a position to reassert French leadership in Europe and in international affairs generally. He (and Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner) have also begun to make their mark, unevenly, on French policy. The foreign policy equivalent of his domestic ""rupture"" are his Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and possibly NATO. On Iraq, Sarkozy and Kouchner have made a dramatic difference, offering political support and associating France with reconstruction efforts -- and prompting surprisingly little opposition or criticism. On NATO, Sarkozy has challenged his bureaucracy -- and the U.S. -- to find a way to fashion a win-win approach for NATO and ESDP that would entail a full French ""return"" to NATO, although the specifics of Sarkozy's conditions have not yet been worked through. Sarkozy will be calculating the political cost of any shift on NATO, knowing that he would be breaking a foreign policy consensus that has long enjoyed the support of the Gaullist right, much of the center, and all of the left. Other issues already showing Sarkozy's imprint include: Russia, where he is less willing to accommodate and is increasingly concerned about Russian intentions and objectives; the Middle East, where he has introduced a new emphasis on Israel's security into the inhospitable ground of France's ""politique Arabe""; and, Africa, where Sarkozy appears intent on finally making a break from France's post-colonial reflexes and relationships. Other high priority issues which Sarkozy will also want to discuss include his top issue, climate change, along with Iran, Kosovo, Burma, Darfur, counterterrorism and climate change. Sarkozy's approach to these and other international issues of concern to both France and the U.S. are discussed in the second section of this cable. PART TWO: PARIS 00004357 005 OF 011 KEY POLICY ISSUES: WHERE THEY ARE AND WHERE WE WANT THEM TO BE 17. (C) The White House has already publicly enumerated key topics on the visit agenda: Afghanistan, Iran, Middle East Peace, Lebanon, Darfur, Burma, Kosovo, counterterrorism, and the promotion of democracy. Herein follows a snapshot of where the French are on each of them and on some additional areas, and where we would like to move them. Our list is topped by thee priority policy issues -- Iraq, NATO, and Russia -- sufficiently sensitive not to have been publicly highlighted in the White House announcement, along with Afghanistan, followed by climate change, which will likely be highest on Sarkozy's list. 18. (C) Iraq: The sudden and dramatic French decision, days following the President's meeting in Kennebunkport, to break with previous policy and reengage with Iraq has uncertain paternity -- with both Sarkozy and Kouchner claiming credit. Following Kouchner's three-day visit to Iraq in August, the GOF has already hosted both President Talibani and FM Zebari. Last week, Sarkozy told Talibani that France wanted to help Iraq across the board -- politically, diplomatically, educationally, and culturally. French assistance will not include any commitment of French troops in Iraq, but it could include training for Iraqi security/police units as well as counterterrorism forces. The French have promised other, initially symbolic measures such as opening a diplomatic office in the northern city of Irbil and aid for a hospital in the same area. Kouchner has already pressed the EU to become more active in multinational efforts at reconstruction, which France would like the UN to head up. Any U.S. diplomatic conference or initiative could garner French support: Kouchner plans to attend the upcoming ministerial meeting in Istanbul of Iraq's ""neighbors."" In fact, the French are just starting to figure out how they can best help Iraq, especially to relieve what they see as a harsh humanitarian situation. Sarkozy would likely be open to detailed discussion on this topic: Given his and Kouchner's identification with the new policy, and abiding lack of enthusiasm in at least parts of the bureaucracy, he is in fact the best place to start. Regarding the U.S. role, Sarkozy and Kouchner do not share their predecessors' fixation on our continued troop presence. They understand and acknowledge the reality that a hasty pullout of U.S. troops would lead to a worsening, not a lessening, of the violence with potentially grave implications for the larger region. We should push Sarkozy to implement humanitarian and reconstruction programs in Iraq, starting with an already promised medical clinic in the Kurdish north, as soon as possible. 19. (C) Iran: Sarkozy's blunt language on the ""unacceptability"" of a militarily nuclear Iran, and the need to maintain maximum pressure on the Iranian regime over its nuclear program has only been exceeded by that of his foreign minister. The degree to which France has taken a public lead with the EU to press for additional European sanctions should the UNSC be unable to act has been as impressive as has Sarkozy's willingness to confront Russian President Putin over this issue. French officials make the point that Paris has a ""normal"" diplomatic relationship with Tehran despite sharp disagreements on the nuclear question. In this context, the French have particularly valued their quiet dialogue over Lebanon, which has convinced them that, by contrast with Syria, Iran has no interest in renewed internal violence that might accompany failure to elect a new president. Sarkozy has proven impervious to Iranian blandishments aimed at softening France's position or even to break it away from the P-5 1 group, much to Iran's chagrin. The meetings with Sarkozy offer an opportunity to bolster France's tough line, and it can be expected that Sarkozy will want to get a sense from the President of his analysis of our PARIS 00004357 006 OF 011 ability to influence Iranian choices, and how best to maintain international pressure toward that end. Having just met with Israeli PM Olmert to discuss the same issue, Sarkozy will be keen to understand the limits of our patience while we pursue the diplomatic track, which, like us, France prefers to exhaust before considering military options. 20. (C) NATO: In one of his first acts as President, Sarkozy launched a defense ""white paper"" commission to review France's defense and security priorities; one component of the report (expected in March 2008) is a review of France's relationship with NATO. The defense white paper could set the stage for a possible full re-integration into the NATO military command. President Sarkozy and Defense Minister Morin launched a public debate over a deeper French role in the Alliance in September in two major foreign policy speeches. Sarkozy clarified that French rapprochement to NATO would be tied to two conditions: 1) strengthening European defense structures by developing Europe's own capabilities to plan and carry out defense and security operations, and 2) seeking French representation in the highest ""decision making posts of NATO."" The MFA and defense establishment uniformly caution us against raised expectations, with some in the Sarkozy Administration (reportedly including Prime Minister Fillon) concerned that abrupt moves toward NATO could be controversial domestically. All, beginning with Sarkozy, argue that, at a minimum, ESDP needs to be strengthened in parallel. The idea seems to be that a French embrace of NATO will ease U.S. concerns about a more robustly structured European defense, while progress on that front will help ease opposition at home to France's ""return"" to NATO. Sarkozy will likely use his speech before Congress to further refine his public approach, casting France's willingness to move ahead in terms of working with the U.S. as an independent ally and partner (not automatically ""aligned"" to U.S. positions). We believe this visit offers an unprecedented opportunity to identify with Sarkozy the common ground on which a mutually beneficial ""bargain"" on NATO and European defense might be elaborated. In addition to addressing the substance of Sarkozy's two ""conditions,"" we will want to learn how open he is to modifying France's narrowly military, Europe-focused vision of NATO, and whether he will be on a sufficiently fast track to implement or in some way foreshadow elements of a ""bargain"" at Bucharest in April. 21. (C) Afghanistan: After a moment of hesitation during his Presidential campaign, Sarkozy now publicly highlights the importance of French efforts in Afghanistan. France has recently stepped up military commitments by deploying 3 additional Operational Mentoring and Liaison Teams (OMLTs) to complement the 2,000 military personnel (ISAF and OEF) now deployed (largely in and around Kabul). Significantly, Sarkozy recently responded positively to the Dutch Prime Minister's pleas for a French presence in Uruzgan, needed to secure parliamentary approval for renewing the Netherlands' participation in ISAF. In agreeing to deploy a French OMLT, Sarkozy again demonstrated his willingness to move ahead of more cautious advisors and a bureaucracy that prefers slow adaptation to bold moves. France has taken other decisions to bolster its presence in Afghanistan including moving six French Mirage planes from Dushanbe to Kandahar. On September 10, the French and Germans reaffirmed plans to support the German-led EU police training mission in Afghanistan despite delays. On July 30, SACEUR officially requested six medium-lift helicopters to provide rotary-wing support in ISAF (to replace the U.S. helicopters which are scheduled to depart early 2008). France is considering still this request. We should use the opportunity of the visit to persuade the French to broaden and deepen their efforts in Afghanistan, including by standing up a Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT). We understand the Presidency favors this proposal, while civilian leadership at the MOD opposes a French PRT. Sarkozy may echo recent MFA and MOD PARIS 00004357 007 OF 011 calls for a more ""comprehensive Afghanistan strategy,"" integrating military support and civilian reconstruction, and including a timeline for shifting the burden from the international coalition to the Government of Afghanistan. 22. (SBU) Environment/Climate Change: Climate Change: On his election day, Sarkozy called for a greater U.S leadership role on climate issues. He will want to come out of his meeting with the President able to say that he again pushed the President to lead. The Embassy, backed closely by Washington agencies, has impressed on not only Sarkozy and his staff, but also officials across France that the U.S. has been leading and continues to lead in the fight against climate change. We've impressed on them -- and Sarkozy should be told again -- that the U.S. has spent $37 billion in the past six years -- more than any other country -- for climate science and energy research. We've developed new international partnerships, part of a real strategy of international engagement to reduce carbon emissions. We've shown the French that even with considerably greater economic and population growth than in Europe, we're doing a better job at reducing both energy intensity and carbon emissions. After the President's Major Economies Meeting (MEM) in late September in Washington, French officials offered to host the next meeting while expressing some disappointment with both the lack of agreement on a post-Kyoto emissions goal and U.S. reluctance regarding market-based cap and trade measures. Areas of potential conflict include concerns that a failure for a broad adoption of similar carbon reduction schemes will put European industry at a competitive disadvantage and the possible French advocacy of a European imposed carbon tax on imported goods. Despite extensive U.S.-French collaboration in developing next generation climate-friendly technologies, the French also criticize what they see as U.S. over-reliance on yet-to-be-developed technologies (carbon capture and storage, second generation bio-fuels, and advanced nuclear) to address emissions. France is skeptical that China and India and other major emerging economies will take steps to reduce emissions unless the U.S. moves first. This is an opportunity to convince Sarkozy that we take this issue seriously and have a concrete plan to make real progress. 23. (C) Democracy Promotion/Burma: Under President Sarkozy, the French position on Burma has converged with that of the U.S. France vigorously condemned the regime's crackdown on peaceful protesters; pushed through as UNSC president a presidential statement supporting the democracy movement; supported toughening EU sanctions; and, bilaterally pressed ASEAN members to take a tougher stand on Burma. FM Kouchner will have visited ASEAN countries and China in the week before Sarkozy's visit to Washington to push the Burmese leadership to reconcile with Aung San Suu Kyi and the political opposition. While Sarkozy seems forward-leaning (he reportedly considered French disinvestment before being dissuaded by advisors), thus far France remains unprepared to implement unilateral sanctions. Sarkozy, however, has urged French companies to freeze future investments. In our efforts to work with France to promote democracy, we should appeal to Sarkozy to redouble French efforts within the EU to push for tough sanctions against the Junta and for measures in support of the democracy movement. 24. (C) Russia: During his first presidential visit to Russia on October 9-10, Sarkozy's advisors were reportedly struck by Putin's defiant and distrustful attitude toward the U.S. and his ""revisionist"" desire to dismantle or undermine the perceived anti-Russian institutional framework -- regional and international -- that has prevailed since the fall of the Soviet Union. Sarkozy made little or no progress with Putin on a broad range of topics including Iran, missile defense, Georgia and Kosovo. Sarkozy's positions tracked with U.S. views except on Georgia, where he favors future status that is short of NATO membership. Sarkozy's visit to Moscow highlights a sea-change in Franco-Russian relations PARIS 00004357 008 OF 011 from the Chirac era. Sarkozy has abandoned Chirac's notion of Russia as a counterweight to the U.S., and does not shy away from directly addressing difficult issues, including democracy, human rights and rule of law problems in Russia, Chechnya and energy policies. Sarkozy, for example, took the unprecedented (for a French President) step of visiting human rights activists while in Moscow. France is concerned about both Putin's increasingly authoritarian style and Russia's increasing willingness to defy international opinion, as on CFE and Georgia. Sarkozy is also less willing than Chirac to allow energy security and trade priorities to dominate France's appoach. That said, the French never fail to remind us of Russia's relative proximity and France's and Europe's need to come to terms with a newly assertive Russia. Sarkozy will want to address how the U.S. can work with France, in cooperation with its major European partners, to find a new modus vivendi with Russia. We should use the meetings with Sarkozy to solidify a common approach of tough engagement with Russia and highlight the need for the closest cooperation on four related subjects: Georgia, Kosovo, Missile Defense and the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty. 25. (C/NF) Georgia: In Moscow October 9-10, Sarkozy told Putin that France opposes full NATO membership for Georgia (although we have been assured he did not address MAP for Georgia with him). High-level French interlocutors have emphasized in recent meetings that France remains open to ""something less than membership."" The GOF has maintained that NATO membership ""should not create new lines of division"" and that territorial conflicts should be resolved prior to membership -- and that Georgia does not meet these criteria. France is considering whether NATO could offer Georgia a different kind of status and a different approach to regional security, possibly combined with incentives including abolishing visas with the EU. While we are aware of reports that Sarkozy told Georgian President Saakashvili that he supports MAP for Georgia, the GOF continues to oppose MAP which would, in its view, create additional tensions with Russia and exacerbate Georgia's problems with its separatist regions. It also talks about the need to define the territorial limits of NATO and its Article 5 collective security obligations. 26. (C) Kosovo: This is an opportunity for the President to reaffirm Sarkozy's commitment to an independent Kosovo. Sarkozy has stated numerous times that he supports Kosovo's independence and has instructed FM Kouchner to actively seek EU consensus on the matter. The French also remind us from time to time that Kosovo is a European issue which Europeans bear primary responsibility for solving. The GOF is pessimistic that Serbia and Kosovo will come to a status agreement and is working closely with the U.S. and the Contact Group on post-December 10 actions. The French remain concerned that while EU member-states may agree to not publicly oppose Kosovo's independence, the EU may fail to reach consensus on a legal basis for an ESDP mission in Kosovo. The GOF has accepted UNSCR 1244 as a basis for an international force in Kosovo and agrees with the U.S. that it would not be advantageous to seek a new UNSCR. Sarkozy lobbied Putin in Moscow for more Russian flexibility, but received no commitments. The U.S. and EU, Sarkozy will argue, must publicly demonstrate that a good faith effort was made to come to an agreement. The French are not prepared to recognize independence before the end of 2007 and are hopeful that the U.S. will assist in convincing the Kosovars that it is in their interest to be patient with the EU. Sarkozy will likely ask that the U.S. work closely with Kosovar authorities to take a coordinated (U.S, EU, Kosovo) approach to Kosovo's now almost inevitable unilateral declaration of independence (UDI), and avoid dramatic rhetoric that will further embarrass Serbia, encourage similar UDIs by Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and put internal political pressure on EU states like Greece and Cyprus to publicly oppose Kosovo's PARIS 00004357 009 OF 011 independence. 27. (C) Missile Defense: The French agree that Russia's objections to the planned system are politically driven, reflecting a Russian view of its relationship with its former satellites that is at once ""revisionist"" but is also informed by real fears of NATO encirclement. The GOF is interested in U.S. plans for NATO to adopt a complementary system to protect the exposed southern flank of Europe from short- and medium-range threat, although it has warned that there is ""not one Euro"" allocated to pay for such a system. Sarkozy will be interested in learning of the status of U.S.-Russian discussions and our analysis of prospects for bringing Moscow around to support a cooperative effort. We should urge Sarkozy to use his leadership position in Europe to promote understanding of the true nature and scope of the MD initiative, one that in no way threatens Russia. 28. (C) CFE: The French government remains concerned over the Russian threat to suspend participation in the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) in December and strongly supports a unified Allied position in support of the U.S. ""parallel actions"" plan. FM Kouchner recently wrote to Secretary Rice to propose an informal CFE seminar in Paris on SIPDIS November 5-6 to promote constructive dialogue leading to a comprehensive political solution. These efforts are seen as key to keeping allied solidarity and building pressure on Russia to recognize the consequences of pulling out of a major arms control treaty. Despite these efforts, the French are increasingly pessimistic; Political Director Gerard Araud was told recently in Moscow that ""the decision was already made"" by Putin and the MOD to suspend participation, due in part to Russian views that it is ""humiliating"" to have flank limits imposed on Russian forces within its own borders. We should welcome French initiatives to help resolve the CFE issue and continue our close collaboration. 29. (C) Lebanon: Sarkozy has not been as closely associated as FM Kouchner with French efforts to help Lebanon elect a new president and emerge from its present political crisis, but he has played a key supporting role. Initially unimpressed with the March 14 majority leaders he met, Sarkozy?s view of Saad Hariri has improved with subsequent meetings. After their last session, Sarkozy authorized announcement of France?s tranche of more than $6 million for the Special Tribunal, which France had been withholding pending a formal request for contributions by the UN Secretary-General. Our close consultations with the French SIPDIS over Lebanon continue, although we differ over tactics and the risks attached to any strategy that would allow the majority to elect a president via simple majority. The French emphasize finding a ""consensus"" candidate acceptable to all Lebanese and external parties and place more trust than we believe wise in Lebanese parliamentary speaker Nabih Berri, despite his association with the pro-Syrian minority. While the French have revived limited contact with Syria to discuss Lebanon, we do not believe they intend to go further at this stage. We will want to discuss with Sarkozy how to keep pressure on the Lebanese to elect a president by the November 24 deadline without compromising the gains we have made over the past two years in terms of reducing Syrian influence and reasserting Lebanese independence. We will want to impress on him that the election of a President -- whether by majority of consensus -- by November 24 is a must; fear of the repercussions of election of a President by a ""mere"" majority should not be ruled out if it is the only way to prevent a void that the Syrians would only be too happy to fill. 30. (C) Middle East Peace Process: Sarkozy will want to hear about our efforts to convene a regional meeting in support of Israeli/Palestinian efforts at achieving a two-state solution. The French have generally supported our efforts and not tried to get out in front. They are, PARIS 00004357 010 OF 011 however, eager to play some sort of role. Sarkozy has taken to using his bona fides as a ""friend of Israel"" to call on it for more ""creativity"" and ""gestures"" toward the Palestinians in the run-up to the meeting. The GOF recently announced its intention to host a donor's conference for humanitarian assistance to help the Palestinian people -- as an end in itself and in support of the political process. Sarkozy will mostly be in a listening mode, though as someone who has sought since taking office to underscore his readiness to listen at least as attentively to the Israeli point of view as the Arab one. 31. (C) France-EU: President Sarkozy was instrumental in re-activating the moribund political reform process in the European Union with the June negotiation for a shortened ""reform treaty"" that will simplify some of the EU's operating procedures, while side-stepping efforts of deepened political integration that doomed the EU constitution in 2005. This ""reform treaty"" was approved by EU leaders in Lisbon last week and is scheduled to be signed in December with ratification over the course of 2008. Sarkozy has said publicly he wants France to be the first country to ratify the simplified treaty; the process of parliamentary ratification will begin in December. The French will also take over the rotating EU presidency from July-December 2008 and plan to focus on immigration, energy, the environment and European defense during their term. While Sarkozy remains firmly opposed to EU enlargement to include Turkey, he has effectively sidestepped this issue by supporting continued negotiations on the acquis communautaire that do not pre-suppose membership. He also conditioned his position on EU support for a ""Committee of Wise Men"" to reflect ""without taboos"" on the broader questions about the European future: i.e., what is the European identity, what should the EU's borders be, how to handle common issues, and how deep can political integration go. 32. (C) Colombia: Sarkozy promised during his presidential campaign to work for the release of Franco-Colombian FARC hostage Ingrid Betancourt. He would sorely like to be able to achieve in a few short months what Chirac couldn't despite years of effort. In June of this year, the French pushed Colombian President Alvaro Uribe to release 200 FARC prisoners in an effort to move forward negotiations for the release of FARC hostages. While the prisoner release did not achieve the desired results, the French are now backing Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's offer to negotiate a hostage deal between the Colombian government and FARC guerillas. Sarkozy invited Chavez to Paris in late November. The French admit Chavez is a difficult political actor but accept a ""bargain with the devil"" to advance prospects for the release of an iconic hostage. Sarkozy may ask us to return two FARC leaders in U.S. prison to a third country in order to obtain the release of French hostage. We should ask Sarkozy not to take any steps that would result in separate treatment for Ingrid Betancourt and put U.S. hostages in harm's way. 33. (SBU) GMO Moratorium: When Sarkozy came into office not only did he create a 'mega' environment ministry, but he also directed it to undertake a process, the 'Grenelle', involving all sectors of the economy to reshape French environmental policies. Among the topics considered in the Grenelle was what to do about Genetically Modified Organisms, a subject of considerable domestic concern in France. The result is that France is currently considering a moratorium on biotech planting that would significantly undermine U.S. agricultural exports to Europe. We believe President Sarkozy may support the politically popular moratorium in order to gain capital to use in his reform efforts. 34. (C) Darfur (and Chad, Central African Republic): Sarkozy demonstrated an immediate renewed interest in Africa PARIS 00004357 011 OF 011 upon entering office, with France calling for and organizing the June 25 ministerial conference on Darfur, which served to refocus international attention on that country. The French followed up with a ministerial meeting on Darfur on the margins of the UNGA in New York in September and then hosted a broader Security Council session on Africa for heads-of-state/government. France has been instrumental in organizing a separate Security Council-blessed EU-UN peacekeeping mission in Chad and the Central African Republic (MINURCAT). Paris hopes to deploy this force as soon as practicable. In addition, the French have firmly supported the deployment of the hybrid UN-AU force in Darfur (UNAMID). We should thank Sarkozy for French leadership on Chad and the C.A.R.. Sarkozy may ask for enhanced U.S. financial contributions to MINURCAT.

The advice is highly embarrassing for the European commission (EC) which has long advocated more openness by member states about the technology. The EC appeared to make a major concession in July when it told the 27 member states that they could decide for themselves. But the 15-page legal document, prepared by the legal service of the EU Council of Ministers, states that the EC proposal has an ""invalid legal basis"" and leaves ""strong doubts"" about the compatibility of the proposal with EU and World Trade Organisation laws. ""This confirms that there are legal problems with the EC proposal. It must now be amended by the parliament and the member states,"" said the Greenpeace GM campaigner Marco Contiero in Brussels. However, legal experts said that far from being a defeat for the commission, the opinion gave it the political legitimacy to now push through many new GM crops. ""Member states are caught between a rock and a hard place – if they accept the proposal as it stands, any bans will be extremely vulnerable to legal actions by biotechnology companies, GM farmers, world trade partners, or even the EU commission itself. But if they reject the proposal, the commission will have free reign to authorise a plethora of new GM crops for cultivation,"" said Thijs Etty, assistant professor of EU law at the VU University of Amsterdam. EU countries must now decide whether to vote down the proposal entirely, accept it as it stands, or pressure the EC to amend its text, said Etty. Europe has been deeply split on GM crops for nearly 20 years. Countries including Britain and the Netherlands want the right to grow them on a large scale, but others, led by Italy and Austria, want to be allowed to impose bans. Only two crops are authorised, but a further 24 are in the pipeline. The legal opinion coincides with a major new EU-wide poll showing that opposition to GM food has hardened slightly. According to the latest Eurobarometer poll, conducted in all 27 member states, 61% of people do not want to see the crops grown compared with 57% in 2007. It further suggested that Europeans believe that GM food is fundamentally unnatural (70%), is not safe for their health or that of their family (59%), is not safe for future generations (58%), and benefits some people but puts others at risk (57%). Less than a third of those interviewed believe GM food is good for the economy. Last month more than a million Europeans signed the first ever citizens' initiative calling for a freeze on new authorisations of GM crops. A formal request to the commission to legislate against the crops will be handed to the commission president, José Manuel Barroso, in Brussels in the coming weeks. GM in Europe • Only two GM crops can be legally grown in the EU: a GM maize strain (MON 810) was authorised for commercial cultivation in 1998 and a GM starch potato known as Amflora was authorised for cultivation and industrial processing in March 2010. • More than 20 other requests for authorisation of GMO cultivation, or for their renewal, are ongoing. • Austria, Hungary, France, Germany, Greece and Luxembourg have prohibited the cultivation of the GM maize MON 810 in their territories. • In addition, Austria, Luxembourg and Hungary have notified the European Commission of their decision to prohibit the cultivation of the Amflora potato. Poland has legislation in place forbidding the marketing of all GM seeds. • Spanish farmers grow around 80,000ha (198,000 acres) of GM maize.",,0.10675910043834574

Adam Werbach, a California-based sustainability consultant and former president of the Sierra Club conservation group, told the Guardian that the makers of What the Green Movement Got Wrong did not inform him about the programme's polemical nature when they first approached him to contribute. He says that the final version, which he has seen, does not accurately represent his opinions and that he wants his contribution edited out of the programme. He is now considering making a formal complaint to Ofcom, the UK's media regulator, once the programme has aired. Greenpeace said it also had ""major issues"" with how the film was explained to potential contributors and considered it was ""lied to"" about the film's focus when asked by the film-makers to provide archive footage of environmental protests from the 1960s. Channel 4 and the production company, Darlow Smithson, denied they had misled contributors. The documentary is described by Channel 4 as a film in which ""life-long diehard greens advocate radical solutions to climate change, which include GM crops and nuclear energy"". Contributors such as Mark Lynas, author of Six Degrees, and Stewart Brand, author of The Whole Earth Catalog, are, say the channel, now part of a ""a group of environmentalists across the world [who] believe that, in order to save the planet, humanity must embrace the very science and technology they once so stridently opposed … They argue that by clinging to an ideology formed more than 40 years ago, the traditional green lobby has failed in its aims and is ultimately harming its own environmental cause."" The 75-minute documentary will be followed by a live studio debate chaired by news presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy and will feature ""leading policy makers, commentators, scientists, entrepreneurs and economists"". Guardian columnist George Monbiot is scheduled to be among the 12 panellists taking part in the debate. In a letter sent today to Channel 4's head of news and current affairs, Dorothy Byrne, a coalition of anti-GM campaigners based in the developing world led by India's Vandana Shiva accused the filmmakers of using only two ""southern-based commentators"", both of whom are ""funded by major GMO [genetically modified organisms] companies"". The letter states: ""We are tired of the corporate campaigns which claim to speak for the global south and allege that western-based non-governmental organisations are imposing their beliefs about genetically modified food on our countries."" Adam Werbach said the film ""misrepresents who is to blame for many of our social and environmental problems"". He added: ""Blaming environmentalists for starvation and lack of energy [in developing nations] is like blaming weathermen for the weather."" More specifically, Werbach said Darlow Smithson did not ""accurately share with me the editorial basis of the documentary when they asked me to contribute"". ""They told me they were doing a documentary about the ideas of Stewart Brand, who is a friend of mine, and looking at other inspiring ideas and new ways to protect the planet,"" he said. ""They didn't tell me that it was basically about nuclear reactors and genetically modified foods. They first referred to the film as the 'Stewart Brand documentary' and then they called it the 'New Environmentalists'.""He added: ""I don't feel the film accurately represents my opinions, which leaves me uncomfortable. I'd rather not be part of it. Being critical of the environmental movement is important to make the environmental movement better. But to attack the environmental movement for thousands or millions of deaths in Africa is far beyond anything I believe. I'm upset that I was not told the proper title of this film. I would rather my contribution was edited out of the programme."" Werbach says there are ""four or five, one or two-sentence quotes"" from him in the final film, but that such editing has decontextualised his views: ""For example, a lot of what I was talking about was the American environmental movement and in the interviews I had made it very clear that I was talking about the US but that things are different globally. But that was never made clear in the film."" ""Nuclear power and GM foods are portrayed as the hallmark issues of 'New Environmentalists'. But these have never been issues for me. The opening and closing packages of the film start with a description of these New Environmentalists who believe that the environmental movement has done damage by blocking GM foods and nuclear power. But it would be a real strain to look at my interview and believe that was my opinion.."" Werbach said he now intends to study section seven of Ofcom's broadcast code to see whether he has grounds for an official complaint. The section covers ""fairness"" and, in particular, when a ""person is invited to make a contribution to a programme"". Section 7.3 states that a contributor ""should normally, at an appropriate stage, be told the nature and purpose of the programme, what the programme is about and be given a clear explanation of why they were asked to contribute"". In 2008, Ofcom ruled that Channel 4 had been in breach of section seven of the code when it aired the highly controversial film The Great Global Warming Swindle during the previous year. In particular, Ofcom upheld a complaint made by Prof Carl Wunsch, an oceanographer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, that the programme-makers had failed to properly inform him that the programme was polemic. Doug Parr, Greenpeace's chief scientist, said: ""Like the film itself, the email we were sent by the producers was almost comically misleading. You would have thought Channel 4 would have learned its lesson after the previous controversies, but judging from this latest attempt to set us up, they haven't. ""We've now seen the documentary. It's a slick, expensive piece of film-making, but gets basic stuff flat-out wrong and misrepresents the green movement from start to finish, such as claiming that we told Zambia to reject GM food aid when in reality we recommended that they accept it if that was the only option. After Against Nature [a 1997 documentary about environmentalism that was found by the Independent Television Commission to have misled interviewees about ""the content and purpose of the programmes"" and to have distorted their views ""through selective editing""] and the Great Global Warming Swindle it's a case of 'here we go again'"" A Channel 4 spokesperson said: ""The green movement is not united by one orthodoxy – this is demonstrated by the range of views within the film. All the contributors were briefed extensively on the overarching narrative of the film, which is led by the views of our main interviewees, Stewart Brand and Mark Lynas."" The spokesperson rejected the idea that Werbach had been deliberately misled over the nature of the film and said that the clips of his interview accurately represented his opinions. ""The correspondence with Adam Werbach clearly and accurately describes the basis for the film as the eco-pragmatist thesis of environmentalist Stewart Brand."" She said that he had signed a contributor release for which described the film as examining ""recent revisionist trends in thinking about some key environmental issues including climate change, nuclear power, genetically modified food and pollution."" She said Channel 4 refuted Greenpeace's accusations of inaccuracy. ""Their responses are represented fairly and accurately in a programme that has been meticulously researched over a six-month period."" ""Channel 4's coverage of environmental issues should not be characterised by singling out two programmes which aired in 1997 and 2007. In the past two years alone we have broadcast series such as Man on Earth, feature-length films such as The 11th Hour, The End of the Line, The Cove and An Inconvenient Truth as well as numerous Unreported World investigations and True Stories documentaries on environmental issues."" ""It was made clear that the different titles for the project at the outset were working titles. There was no intention to deceive him, the final title was only chosen and confirmed at the time of billing [two weeks ago]."" Craig Bennett, director of policy and campaigns at Friends of the Earth, said: ""We're always up for having a debate – but we've seen this documentary, and it is a blatant piece of misinformation based largely on the views of paid lobbyists and journalists with books to sell."" Mark Lynas said, ""With the eruption of all this controversy before the film has even been screened, I hear the ominous sound of wagons being circled and minds being closed. The green movement needs to learn to deal with criticism constructively rather than just seeing every difficult issue as a conspiracy of evil corporations and profiteering commercial interests."" ""This is a real debate and the environmental movement needs to tackle it head on rather than asserting that all challengers are part of some imagined evil conspiracy,"" he added.",,0.03361560570576965
181,article,business/2010/oct/10/halifax-grantham-housing-bubble,Business,2010-10-09,This can't go on: house prices must drop or wages must rise. Which seems more likely?,https://gu.com/p/2k96p,News,This can't go on: house prices must drop or wages must rise. Which seems more likely?,One veteran fund manager warns that he has only ever seen two bubbles that have failed to deflate. How much longer can the UK property market remain one of them?,631,"Jeremy Grantham is the veteran fund manager who founded the US investment firm GMO. He is also a specialist in defining and identifying bubbles, which he rightly regards a crucial task in the investment game. He claims to have identified 34 of them over the years and says only two have failed to burst or deflate. One is today's UK housing market. Grantham's findings are worth exploring in light of last week's news from the housing market. The Halifax reported that average house prices fell by more than £6,000 in September to £162,096, a drop of 3.6% from August and the biggest monthly fall on record. Despite such dramatic figures, many economists were sanguine. They said it was far too early to declare that house prices, having recovered about half their post-banking-crisis fall of 15%, had embarked on another lurch downwards. The Halifax's Martin Ellis pointed to the three-month rolling average, which he regards as a better guide to the underlying trend. This showed a decline of 0.9%, a far cry from the quarterly falls of 5% that were seen in the autumn of 2008. Caution in forecasting is indeed a sensible policy. But step back, look at the long-term picture and take note of Grantham's statistical definition of a bubble. He calls it a ""two standard deviation event"", or something that occurs about once every 40 years. On his reckoning, the UK market had gone well beyond that in 2007. His crucial point is that prices revert eventually to the trend that existed before the bubble started to form. In the UK market, he's referring to the affordability of houses as measured as a multiple of earnings. Indeed, the Nationwide each month provides a ""house price to earnings"" graph alongside its own price index. The latest shows prices running at 5.4 times earnings, compared to the long-run average of four times. The difference may not sound vast but the numbers imply that the value of an average house would have to fall 25% tomorrow to get back to the long-term average instantly. That's a powerful statistic. The gap could, in theory, be closed from the other direction – earnings could rise. But how likely is that in the next few years? There is a public sector pay freeze and wage settlements in the private sector are running at less than 2%. Incomes will also be squeezed by the VAT rise in January, the loss of child benefit for higher-income taxpayers in 2013 and by whatever other delights are in store in this month's spending review. Almost the only force acting as a support to affordability is ultra-low interest rates. But the effect of the medicine seems to be wearing off. The number of mortgage approvals, adjusted for seasonality, fell for the fourth month in a row in August. Credit conditions, if anything, are tightening again. Data from chartered surveyors e.serv says the average loan-to-value ratio dropped in September to 57.2%. Life is still not getting much easier for first-time buyers. Meanwhile, Osborne's ability to prop up prices by cutting stamp duty is limited – he needs the cash. Of course, even if Grantham's analysis is correct, house prices are not about to crash by 25% overnight. It is far more likely that the realignment with earnings will be achieved gradually over many years. Lenders are hardly likely to get tough on repossessions – banks want to protect the assets on their balance sheets. In the end, though, you have to think that the cold mathematics of affordability will prevail. We are probably looking at several years when house prices go sideways or steadily downwards. Some areas will inevitably defy that trend. But for most homeowners, especially those who have come to view their home as a form of pension, the outlook is cheerless.",,0.015482489292013107
182,article,environment/2010/oct/07/gm-corn-farming-pests,Environment,2010-10-07,"Farmers next to GM fields benefit from pest reduction, study shows",https://gu.com/p/2k86y,News,"Farmers next to GM fields benefit from pest reduction, study shows",US study finds reduced numbers of crop-damaging pests on corn farms that adjoin those growing GM crops <br />,754,"Farmers growing conventional corn next to GM crops can benefit from the reduction in crop-destroying pests without paying the premium for GM seeds, a new study has shown. The research, published today in the journal Science, examined 14 years of records in the top US corn-producing states of Minnesota, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska and Wisconsin, looking at the prevalence of the European corn borer, a moth whose caterpillars eat into corn stalks and topple the plants. The so-called Bt GM corn varieties were first planted in 1996 and produce toxins taken from a soil bacterium called Bacillus thuringiensis, which is deadly to the pest. In GM fields, the pest is eradicated, but the data showed that in neighbouring non-GMO fields the pest populations shrank by 28-78%, depending on how much GM corn was being grown in the surrounding area. The study also found that the caterpillar-killing GM varieties grown in the vast US corn belt had retained their potency 14 years after being first sown, showing the pests had not developed resistance. Scientists said the demonstration of the ""halo effect"" was a triumph for genetically modified crops. Prof Bruce Tabashnik, an entomologist from the University of Arizona, who was not part of the research team, said: ""It's a wonderful success story. It's a great example of a technology working how it should."" But anti-GM campaigners claimed the full economic, environmental and social impacts of GM crops were not considered. ""There are a whole host of negative impacts which need to be taken into account,"" said Kirtana Chandrasekaran, food campaigner at Friends of the Earth. ""Snapshot studies like these do not give the whole picture."" The researchers, led by Prof Bill Hutchison at the University of Minnesota, also calculated the economic benefits over the 14 years of the GM corn-growing. They valued the extra corn harvested because of the reduction in corn borer numbers and took into account the extra $1.7bn farmers had paid for the GM seeds, equivalent to $10-20 per hectare. The total benefit was $6.8bn but they found it was not evenly distributed: non-GM fields gained two-thirds of the total benefit, despite making up only one-third of the land. ""A grower who is completely non-GM is clearly benefiting in terms of less European corn borer pressure, and damage to their crops,"" said Hutchison, while adding that many farmers in the midwest grew both GM and non-GM corn. He believes the halo effect will apply to other GM crops. Hutchison has previously received small grants from GM seed producers to conduct independent trials of their crops. Chandrasekaran said there are major costs not accounted for by the study, including the loss of income and clean-up costs when GM crops contaminate conventional varieties. She citeed the example of unnapproved GM rice strains found in the US long-grain rice supply in 2006, which led to European countries and Japan blocking rice imports. A class action lawsuit is ongoing and the seed company, Bayer CropScience, has already lost four individual cases and been asked to pay millions of dollars in compensation. Chandrasekaran also said there were environmental costs such as GM-derived toxins in Bt crops running off fields after rain and harming aquatic life. Peter Melchett, policy director for the Soil Association, which promotes organic food, added that the cost of GM seeds was high and rising fast. Anti-GM campaigners argue that farmers can be locked into technologies by companies with powerful market positions and note that Monsanto, the market leader, is being investigated by the US Justice Department for possible anti-trust violations. All sides agree that the rapidly rising proportion of the corn crop grown that is GM is a matter of concern because it could help the corn borer to develop resistance to the Bt toxin. This is because non-GM ""refuges"" allow some moths that are susceptible to the toxin to survive, and then mate with the few that are naturally resistant, rendering their offspring vulnerable too. ""If the Bt crop use – currently 63% of all US corn – gets too high, we are still concerned with the risk of the corn borer and other insect pests developing resistance, and thus loss of a valuable technology,"" said Hutchison. The US Environmental Protection Agency has recently approved a ""refuge in the bag"" approach, in which a mix of 90% GM corn and 10% non-GM corn is sold. Previously farmers had to plant at least 20% non-GM corn. ""As we transition to this, I do have concerns about long-term resistance management and sustainability of the technology,"" Hutchison said.",,0.06604597562930897

Quality is the best policy,Jeremy Grantham's theory that quality shares are undervalued ought to be taken seriously,373,"Jeremy Grantham, the celebrated fund manager at the US investment house GMO, coined a neat phrase in a recent summer essay – the ""Let's all look like Yale syndrome"". He was referring to the Yale University endowment fund, which popularised the idea that long-term investors should allocate surprisingly large portions of their cash to so-called alternative investments, rather than dull old blue-chip stocks and government bonds. As Grantham says: ""In the last 10 years, institutions and even ultra-rich individuals have, in general, been increasing the share of their portfolios that is invested in private equity, hedge funds, commodities and real estate."" Why is this relevant? Well, Grantham makes a convincing case that Yale syndrome is a force right now. There's a ""speculative undertow"" in the investment world, driven by low interest rates, that is chasing supposedly riskier stocks and smaller companies. Meanwhile, at the conservative end of things, everyone is fretting about deteriorating economic conditions, with the result that old-fashioned, blue-chip stocks are going unloved. On a small scale, you can see the phenomenon even in this week's news. Burger King is being taken private in a leveraged buyout, just as it was in 2002. Tomkins is being taken out in similar fashion. Even little old Carluccio's has a billionaire suitor from Dubai willing to pay a 48% takeover premium. Grantham's point is that high-quality stocks were left behind in last year's big stock market rally and the big surprise is that they are still underperforming the smaller and more speculative companies. He is writing in a US context, but the same argument could made about the UK. There are plenty of solid FTSE 100 companies with safe-looking (and rising) dividends offering yields of 5% or so. Even with long-term gilts offering a mere 3%, buyers are in short supply. That's not what you would expect. Grantham is not offering firm predictions on where the market is going next (although he offers odds on various outcomes). The real lesson is that old-fashioned companies with good franchises look cheap on a relative basis and such valuation gaps rarely last forever. For individual investors, perhaps baffled by the current see-saw stock market, that's an observation worth absorbing. If in doubt, ignore the herd and stick to quality.",,0.07001811594202899

Despite more than 12 years of public resistance to GM, knowledge of its drawbacks – from the rampant growth of herbicide-resistant ""superweeds,"" to the loss of insects vital to the food chain – and unknown long-term risks to humans, the debate keeps returning. Yesterday, the European commission (EC) approved changes to how GM food and organisms are regulated. The EC proposals aim to keep the current authorisation system for GM at EU-level, but would give member states the right to ban GM cultivation at a national level. This is something that the Greens/European Free Alliance group in the European parliament has campaigned in favour of for a long while, as it brings greater democratic control of GM cultivation. Once countries can decide for themselves whether or not to grow GM, it will be much easier for GM critics to make national politicians directly accountable for those decisions. The changes would also require that any deliberate release of GM organisms into the environment would have to be adopted in co-decision between member states and the commission. This is the normal legislative procedure in Europe, and it would be in contrast to the commission being able to make decisions purely through regulations. The flip side is that in countries with weak or non-existent legislation on GM, such as the Czech Republic, Spain and the Netherlands, seed and feed that is contaminated with GM will be able to spread around those countries more easily. Farmers that want to remain organic or farm conventionally, will find it harder to do so. It may also present a green-light to the rest of the world, including the US, and South America, to loosen GM regulation in their own jurisdictions. The explicit intent of the commission to bypass the ""widespread opposition to the authorisation of [genetically modified organisms] for cultivation both at member states and citizen's level."" In its ""roadmap"" for the legislation, and also in public, the EC wants to achieve quicker authorisations of GM trials, in exchange for member states being allowed to ban specific GM varieties afterwards. Some aspects of the commission's proposals are still not clear. Would the UK be permitted to declare itself GMO-free? Will member states be able to reject GM that is authorised at the commission level, and not justify it to the EC? Currently, we have no GM crops commercially grown in the UK. However, Britain has consistently lobbied in favour of lifting GM bans, despite the safety concerns raised by other member states. It tried to end the EU moratorium on growing GM; it was the only EU state to oppose a plan to label food containing minute traces of GM material, and last year it battled to prevent Germany banning a Monsanto maize crop. We need a government that has a zero-tolerance for GM contamination, as well for unauthorised GMOs. One of the coalition government's first acts, however, was to approve a trial of GM potatoes in Norfolk. Now that the UK will have more control over GM, we need to use the precautionary principle in our assessment of the potential risks posted by GM crops. To do so, we need a series of measures: • Access to information currently being kept secret by biotechnology companies; • Independent scientific research on GM organisms; • Pesticide-producing GM crops should be treated in the same way as chemical pesticides; • Strict liability needs to be enforced, so that GM polluters pay for any damage; and, • Any food produced from GMOs (animals fed with GM-feed; ingredients with GM content) must be clearly labelled (the Co-Op is already doing this). Opposition to GM crops is hardening in many European governments. Germany banned all GM crops last year, and Austria, France, Greece, Hungary and others invoked a ""safeguard clause"" in EU legislation allowing them to ban them. The UK needs to join this growing trend.",,0.13209325396825397

And why isn't the Labour government, in the throes of an election campaign, crowing more about its apparent skill as an investor? The answer to the first question is that ultra-low interest rates have worked their magic. The economic recovery may still feel fragile and jobless; and a sustained period of cheap money may create greater dangers if another speculative mania is unleashed. But, from the point of view of the banks, there's a lot to be happy about. A year ago, they were making big provisions – not just against duff investments in the past but against losses that recession would produce. Now, if anything, these banks look over-provisioned. Where are the new bad debts? Over the next couple of weeks, all the banks will give first-quarter trading up-dates. But Lloyds let cat out of the bag last month on a critical point: it expects to make a profit this year. That is not what it said three weeks earlier when it unveiled its 2009 figures. Lending margins, it seems, currently look fatter than the banks could have imagined even a few months ago. Better still for them, property, which is the security behind many loans, is rising in price again. RBS does not expect to make a profit this year. But some analysts, looking further ahead, think the bank's balance sheet will be transformed if current trends persist. Merrill Lynch said recently that RBS could have surplus capital of £15bn by 2012. That's a new story for the market. Fund managers, having dismissed RBS as a state-owned relic they could safely ignore for a while, now fear they've missed a new plot line: the result is the 75% surge in RBS' share price since mid-February. Why isn't the government bragging? Up to a point, it is. Chancellor Alistair Darling makes the fair point that actions taken at the height of the crisis have been vindicated. Taxpayers should indeed turn a profit from their adventure in bank shares, just as he predicted. It's just that this profit will feel illusory to one core constituency of voters. Savers, who outnumber borrowers by six to one, are earning next to nothing on their billions of pounds sitting in cash ISAs. For them, ultra-low interest rates are not a cause for celebration. Jeremy Grantham of investment house GMO, writing in a US context, makes the point well in his latest letter to investors: ""Collectively, we forego hundreds of billions of potential interest, but at least we can feel noble because we are helping to restore the financial health of the banks and bankers, who under these conditions could not fail to make a fortune even if brain dead.""",,0.13116883116883113

Just ask the world's most interesting fund manager,"Paul Volcker's bank reforms are exactly what America requires, argues one of its most powerful investors",231,"Jeremy Grantham, founder of big US fund manager GMO, is one of the world's most influential investors – and also one of the slickest commentators on financial matters. His quarterly dispatches are always a treat. The latest deserves to be read widely, especially in Davos, where many of the world's top bankers are campaigning against President Obama's plans to reform the banking system on the grounds that his Paul Volcker-inspired ideas are unworkable or don't address the real problems. Grantham makes two points. First, proprietary-desk trading – banks trading their own capital – creates an obvious conflict of interest. ""Since when wasn't conflict of interest and poor ethical standards reason enough to change the law?"" he asks. Then he hits his stride: ""But since we bring it up, of course prop trading was indeed the rot at the heart of our financial problems. Watching traders take home their $28m bonus sent a powerful message to lowly salesmen and packagers of asset-backed securities, for example, to get out there and really take some risk. ""This rot spread to the very top, and pretty soon chairmen of boards were exhorting CEOs to leverage up and look more like some much more profitable rival that resembled a hedge fund rather than an investment bank. Thus encouraged – or intimidated – some CEOs just kept on dancing right off the cliff. Let's learn from our near disaster. Viva Volcker!"" Bravo.",,0.23586309523809526

Here are some of our favourites, but where can you recommend?",1113,"1. The Masons Arms in Headington, Oxford The Masons Arms is located by the quarry where much of the stone used to build Oxford's colleges was dug up. Now it's home of the Old Bog microbrewery (so named because they have converted the disused outside toilets) and produces a range of beers throughout the year, including 'Quarry W-reck-ed' at 5.5% and 'Half Wit' (5%). It started brewing in 2005 and was voted Oxford Camra pub of the year that same year. Plenty of atmosphere, and hosts comedy and open mic nights as well as its own popular beer festival in September. • masonsquarry.co.uk/, 2 Quarry School Place, Headington, Oxford, OX3 8LH. +44 (0)1865 764579. 2. Fox and Crown, Nottingham The Fox and Crown is a cracking pub that's the beer tap for the Alcazar Brewery. A real local, it prides itself on its traditional cask ales that range from Alcazar Ale to Vixen's Vice (5.2%) and a traditional India Pale Ale Windjammer IPA (6.0%). They also brew interesting bottled beers with names like Bowman's Bounty and Little John's Myth, inspired by tales of local hero Robin Hood. Chistmas will bring their own Maple Magic (4.5%) as well as some special guest brews. Take an extra bag and stock up at the brewery shop. • alcazarbrewery.co.uk, 33 Church Street, Old Basford, NG6 0GA, +44 (0)115 942 2002. 3. The Brunswick Inn, Derby The Brunswick is the oldest brewery in this city known for its real ale pubs. Built in 1842 as a Railway Hostelry (it's a short stagger from Derby station), it was saved from demolition in 1984 and restored saving many of the original features. The stone-flagged bar has an impressive line of handpumps at the counter serving home-brewed beers - two regulars Triple Hop and Second Brew plus four or five rotating – and other regional ales. They have regular jazz and comedy nights and hold a beer festival every year. • brunswickinn.co.uk/, 1 Railway Terrace, Derby, Derbyshire DE1 2RU, +44 (0)1332 290677. 4. Sair Inn, Linthwaite, West Yorkshire Roaring fires in winter, juke box classics, friendly locals and celebrated ales – even dogs are welcome at the Sair Inn. This cosy four-room pub has built up quite a reputation among real-ale lovers for its Linfit beers brewed in the back of the pub, like Enochs Hammer (a sturdy pint at approx 8.6%) and good guest ales. Guinness lovers should try their own English Guinness stout. Not surprisingly a former winner of Camra national pub of the year. • Linfit Brewery, Sair Inn, Lane Top, Linthwaite, Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, HD7 5SG, +44 (0)1484 842370. 5. The Moulin Arms, Perthshire, Scotland The Moulin Arms just outside Pitlochry has been serving the locals for over 300 years. Nowadays it has its own microbrewery – one of the first in Scotland - and serves delicious beers brewed mere feet away (Braveheart ale is particularly good), plus the biggest servings of food you'll ever see. Truly staggering. You'll find no pool tables or juke boxes here, just cosy niches and open fires to drink by. • moulininn.co.uk, Moulin Pitlochry, Perthshire, Scotland, PH16 5EY. +44 (0)1796 472196. 6. Swan on the Green, Maidstone, Kent The Swan in West Peckham (that's Kent not London) looks out over a country cricket green. On a summer day sit out on the picnic tables or lounge on the grass with a pint of ale brewed right there on the premises. In the winter it's cosy, wooden interior makes for a warm and hearty stop-off from a muddy Weald of Kent cycle. Try Bewick (5.3%) or cask conditioned Trumpeter Best Bitter (4.0%). They also serve good pub grub – all organic, locally sourced and GMO free. • swan-on-the-green.co.uk, The Green, West Peckham, Maidstone, Kent, ME18 5JW, +44 (0)1622 812271. 7. Burton Bridge Inn The original Burton Bridge brewery pub (there are now four others) is a great spot to savour a pint of one of the brewery's many award-winning beers. A real pub-lover's pub with wood-panelled walls, an open fire, and a skittle alley for a more energetic drinking session. You will usually find seven of the brewery's beers on tap, together with a selection of fruit wines. They're serving their hoppy Hearty Ale (5%) over the winter months. • burtonbridgebrewery.co.uk, Burton Bridge Inn, 24 Bridge Street, Burton upon Trent, Staffs, DE14 1SY, +44 (0)1283 536596. 8. Dark Star Brewery – Evening Star Brighton When the Evening Star became a freehouse in 1992 the owner converted half the cellar into a microbrewery. When demand grew the brewery moved to nearby Ansty but still supplies the pub with it's golden Hophead bitter (3.8%) as well as rotating Dark Star beers. You'll also find a choice of real ciders and international bottled beers. A short hop away from Brighton Station, it's often missed by the visiting crowds heading down to the seafront. Also handy for catching the last train back to London if you're on a day trip to the coast. Look out for its one-batch-a-year Critical Mass (7.2%) Christmas ale - sure to get you singing Fairytale Of New York in the manner of Shane MacGowan himself. • eveningstarbrighton.co.uk, 55/56 Surrey Street, Brighton, BN1 3PB, +44 (0)1273 328931. 9. The Watermill, Ings, Cumbria Best not to drive to this year's Cumbria Camra pub of the year as the dizzying number of beers will make choosing just ""one for the road"" a tough call – up to 16 are served on traditonal hand pumps. You could do worse than opt for their award-winning Collie-wobbles (3.7%), a pale refreshing bitter brewed in the micro-brewery on site. The pub's based just a couple of miles east of Lake Windermere as you enter the Lakes. Very popular with walkers and decidely dog-friendly – they even offer doggy snacks. • watermillinn.co.uk, Ings, near Windermere, The Lake District LA8 9PY, +44 (0)1539 821309. 10: The Old Cannon Brewery, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk At the Old Cannon the stainless steel brewing vessels stand right beside the bar, so you could literally watch the beer being made in front of you. As well as serving four or five of their home brews, like Old Cannon Best Bitter (3.8%) or Gunner's Daughter (5.5%) they guest Suffolk's famous local Adnam's bitter, Suffolk Aspall cyder and Calvors, a local lager from Coddenham. You can fill up with up to 36 pints of your favourite Cannon ale and take it home for later. Their food is very tempting too – you could call the Cannon a bit of a gastro pub – try locally made scotch eggs, Gunner's Daughter sausages, beer battered fish or beef and ale pie (notice the beer themed recipes there). • oldcannonbrewery.co.uk, 86 Cannon Street, Bury St Edmunds, IP33 1JR, +44 (0)1284 768769.",,0.20207581472432962

A report from ADP showed that US private employers cut 298,000 jobs in August, more than the forecast 250,000. The figures come ahead of the key US non-farm payroll numbers from the US government, due on Friday. With investors wondering if the data is a sign that the stock market has run ahead of economic reality, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down more than 20 points. The FTSE 100 has fallen 34.78 points to 4784.92 The drop in the leading index would have been worse if not for BP, whose near 3.5% rise represents a gain of almost 18 FTSE points. BP is currently 17p higher at 536.55p following news of its ""giant"" - not a word it often uses in a press release about an oil find - discovery in the Gulf of Mexico. Financials and miners remain among the biggest fallers, the former on more balance sheet worries, the latter on fears of declining demand if the economic recovery proves to be short lived. And some commentators are not convinced we are out of the woods yet. The much followed strategist Albert Edwards at Societe Generale says in his latest piece of research: ""Despite clear signs from the business surveys of some sort of second half recovery, firm evidence is emerging that the global economy is sliding towards a full-blown deflationary episode once this recovery falters. ""Equity markets should be far more nervous than they currently are. We heartily concur with GMOs Jeremy Grantham who remarked recently that after 20 years of more or less permanent overvaluation of US equities, we saw just five months of under-pricing through the March trough.

189,article,business/2009/apr/05/recession-economy,Business,2009-04-04,Ruth Sunderland: We've yet to put our houses in order,https://gu.com/p/26jb2,News,We've yet to put our houses in order,,1045,"Gordon Brown's hopes of positioning himself as the saviour of the UK economy, if not the planet, have been boosted by the promises of a new world order coming out of the G20 summit in London, but it is a bit premature to suggest he has resurrected his political fortunes. His claim that the G20 agreement could lift the world out of recession next year looks hyperbolic. I don't want to be churlish, but there is no new major fiscal stimulus; there is not enough on green investment; it is not clear that the G20 has beaten back protectionist impulses; and there are no concrete measures on banks' toxic assets. In any case, voters in the UK are less interested in the global picture than they are in the situation much closer to home - quite literally, their own home: Brown's success with the electorate will depend more on the state of the UK housing market than on his gladhanding on the international stage. The surprise uptick in the Nationwide house price index for March, downplayed by the lender itself as a blip, set off a flurry of speculation that the market had bottomed; that, though, says more about our national obsession with property than it does about the green shoots of recovery. Estate agents are certainly hoping that the drop in interest rates, and the fall in house prices we have already seen, will do the trick. They point to a rise in mortgage approvals to a nine-month high of 37,900 in February, from a low point of 27,330 in November, and to an easing in credit conditions, as two big lenders, HSBC and the Woolwich, cut the size of the downpayment they demand from borrowers to qualify for cheap deals. My instinct is that this is wishful thinking. Mortgage approvals are still 65% lower than pre-crunch levels, and well below the early 1990s downturn, and although a couple of lenders have cut the size of the deposits they require, it isn't a huge help to first-time buyers, who still have to put down 25-30% of the purchase price to get the best deals. The rival Halifax index, which registered a drop of 1.9% last month, gives a bit of ballast to my view that the slump in property values is far from over, though transaction volumes are so low that it is hard to take a robust reading from either. The key determinant of house prices is unemployment, and with a jobless total of more than 2 million and 4,000 UK jobs going last week alone from companies including British Airways, Aviva, and Bombardier in Northern Ireland, the picture is grim. The rate of business failures, according to new research from Equifax, is 35% higher in the first quarter of this year than in the same period of 2008; although companies are now going bust at a slower rate, there is a risk that more will tip over the edge in the new tax year because they are unable to meet Revenue demands. Hardly surprising, then, that borrowers are taking the fall in interest rates not as a buy signal but an opportunity to pay down their mortgage debts. House prices have fallen by about 21% since their peak in October 2007 but UK domestic property is still significantly overvalued. The Halifax house price to earnings ratio remains almost 10% above its long-run average. IHS Global Insight is predicting a further 15% drop from here; fund manager Jeremy Grantham of GMO is forecasting a further 25% fall. We must hope that Gordon Brown is right and that there are pinpricks of light at the end of the tunnel. But house prices, which had soared into the realms of fantasy, need to recouple with wages, employment and the performance of the economy as a whole. That journey back to reality is not over yet. Don't forget about childcare, Lord Mandelson - you won't rescue the economy without it Lord Mandelson is, quite rightly, looking at a new industrial activism so that the UK can chart a path away from our unhealthy overdependence on financial services and the City. He is identifying strategic businesses as those that are green, highly skilled, digital and creative. That's all wonderful: I would just add ""family-friendly"" to the list. The current downturn threatens women's employment like never before. In past recessions in the UK and the US, female incomes have insulated families because male-dominated industries were worst hit, but not this time: sectors such as retail, which have a predominantly female workforce, are in the frontline. There is also likely to be a second wave of job losses in the public sector - a major employer of women - later on in the recession, as the state and local government are forced to cut costs. Many women who lost their jobs in the dotcom bust found it hard to regain a foothold in the workplace; the 2001 downturn signalled the end of the long-term rise in women's employment rate. That is not just a problem for career women but for millions of ordinary families: working wives typically bring home a third of household income, and single mothers are sole breadwinners. Employers and the government need to take steps to make sure family-friendly working and childcare do not suffer in the recession. If skilled and talented women are driven out of the workforce, it will be a huge loss to individual employers and the economy as a whole. Flexibility, on the other hand, can help both employers, seeking to trim costs, and employees, who want to keep their jobs. Childcare is key. If a woman has to work reduced hours, the economics of sending a child to nursery may no longer work, and if too many children leave, private sector facilities may go out of business. Nursery care does not cease to matter just because a mother loses her job: the lack of it can make it harder for her to attend interviews or to return to the workplace. Making family-friendly working and childcare strategic priorities will not only help parents through the recession but also boost consumption and growth. Childcare should no longer be viewed as just a women's issue, but as a key part of the economic infrastructure.",,0.07935709382311323
190,article,environment/2009/mar/24/marie-mason-speaks-from-jail,Environment,2009-03-24,Activist or terrorist? Mild-mannered eco-militant serving 22 years for arson,https://gu.com/p/26azv,News,Activist or terrorist? Mild-mannered eco-militant serving 22 years for arson,"'The government is trying to send a message,' Marie Mason tells the Guardian in her first interview since she was sentenced",1064,"She is, in the eyes of the law, America's most dangerous eco-terrorist: a self-confessed serial arsonist who resorted to fire and destruction to register her opposition to the fur industry and genetically modified crops. But to those who know her and to some legal experts, the 22-year jail term handed to Marie Mason, 47, is a consequence of America's preoccupation with terrorism in the post-9/11 world. She is serving the longest sentence of any convicted animal rights or environmental militant, including several activists responsible for greater destruction. ""It is obvious the government is trying to send a message – to have a chilling effect, not only on my action, which of course transgressed the laws, but also on 30 years of above-ground actions in the environmental rights spheres,"" Mason told the Guardian in her first interview since she was sentenced last month. Mason was convicted on the evidence of her fellow arsonist and ex-husband, Frank Ambrose. He was jailed for nine years. ""It's very, very sad. These are karmic things that Frank will have to deal with on his own,"" she said. The explosive fire Mason and Ambrose set at Michigan State University on 31 December 1999 caused nearly $1m (£680,000) of damage to buildings and equipment, but no death or injuries. The target was the office of the director of a genetically modified crop research programme into moth-resistant food crops for Africa, funded by the US Agency for International Development and the biotechnology company Monsanto. Professor Daniel Clay, who worked at the institute in 1999 and is now the director, said the attack had a severe impact on the staff. ""It really was a shock,"" he said. ""It was a very difficult period for all of us. People were frightened and we asked ourselves how close did this come to physically harming someone."" However, Mason's lawyer, John Minock, who filed an appeal against the sentence last week, argues that 22 years is excessively harsh. Mason got a much longer sentence than several militants recently convicted of setting fire to logging camps and vehicles in Oregon and Washington states – including Stanislas Meyerhoff who received 13 years for setting 11 fires and causing $30m in damage. ""Giving her a 22-year sentence is like using a cannon to shoot a mouse,"" Minock said. ""She is a 47-year-old, mild-mannered woman with no previous criminal record other than trespassing."" The FBI had singled out militant environmentalists and animal rights activists as domestic security threats even before the 9/11 attacks. Since then, the courts have used domestic terrorism laws to stiffen the punishment for politically inspired violence. Mason is a prime example. ""We are definitely seeing more severe sentences post-9/11, no doubt about it,"" said Heidi Boghosian, the director of the National Lawyers Guild. ""We have seen a trend of using the terrorist label and federalising a lot of criminal activities that would have gotten a far less stringent sentence before."" Lauren Regan, an Oregon lawyer who defends environmental militants, calls it the ""green scare"". To those in Mason's home city of Detroit who know her, her elevation to the ranks of America's most dangerous criminals came as a shock. A fixture in activist circles, she was bright and charming, but unfocused – a woman who had an advanced degree in chemistry but lived near the poverty line. They saw her as a doting mother to her adult son and teenage daughter, a soft touch who took in stray dogs and named them after revolutionary heroines, an amateur folk singer and a passionate supporter of various causes. But not, they say, the organiser of a series of attacks. ""She is one of those people that, whenever there would be a demonstration, she would be there,"" said Peter Werbe, a Detroit broadcaster who has known Mason for 20 years. ""I don't think she ever rose to prominence as a figure in the city."" A long-time acquaintance said: ""If you look at the court documents, Frank is always the one lighting the fire, she is always the one spray-painting the wall. That, in a nutshell, is who she is. Marie is always the support staff."" Mason met the man who was to become her third husband in 1998. Ambrose, now 34, was well-known among forestry activists in the mid-west and was leading a workshop for activists. Mason says there was an instant attraction. The two were soon living together and married, although the relationship was troubled. At about 9pm on New Year's Eve 1999, the couple entered an office in the Institute of International Agriculture at Michigan State University and doused it with petrol. The arson, by Mason's own account, was botched. A fireball set her hair on fire, forcing the couple to run before she even managed to write her slogan, ""No GMO"". The next day, the pair set fire to a logging camp. She has also admitted to burning boats belonging to the owner of a mink farm. When asked whether the fires might have terrified staff and students at the university, she said: ""It was intended as an enlightenment moment that people would see what is going on beneath the surface."" Clay argues his institute's research was aimed at creating a more sustainable agriculture, an ambition he believes should be shared by environmentalists. ""It was most important to us that the perpetrators were caught and that justice was served,"" he said. The couple nearly got away with it but were caught in March 2007. By then, the two had split up. Ambrose, who was cleaning out his possessions, left gas masks, fuses, maps and explosives in a rubbish dump. The material was discovered by a man who called the authorities. Eventually, the gas masks led the FBI to Ambrose, who agreed to turn informer. He wore a wire and gave Mason a mobile phone, to help the FBI monitor her conversations. Mason, in her jail cell, has often thought about those talks. ""I did think that some of our conversations were very strained and strange but I attributed that to the fact that Frank was a very nervous person and he was under a lot of pressure,"" she said. ""I was the last to know that Frank was unreliable.""

But are they a danger to us all?,1203,"The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Monday March 23 2009 We said in the report below that the BioWeatherMap project had been nicknamed Google Flu. To clarify, there is no connection between DIYbio, the organisation that runs BioWeatherMap, and Google Meredith Patterson is not your typical genetic scientist. Her laboratory is based in the dining room of her San Francisco apartment. She uses a plastic salad spinner as a centrifuge and Ziploc plastic bags as airtight containers for her samples. But the genetically modified organism (GMO) she is attempting to create on a budget of less than $500 (£350) could provide a breakthrough in food safety. The 31-year-old ex-computer programmer and now biohacker is working on modifying jellyfish genes and adding them to yoghurt to detect the toxic chemical melamine, which was found in baby milk in China last year after causing a number of deaths, and kidney damage to thousands of infants. Her idea is to engineer yoghurt so that in the presence of the toxin it turns fluorescent green, warning the producer that the food is contaminated. If her experiment is successful, she will release the design into the public domain. ""I haven't had a huge amount of success so far,"" says Patterson. ""But science is often about failing until you get it right."" She has decided to invest in an electroporator she found on eBay for $150, which should speed things up. ""It's actually not that hard. It's a bit like making yoghurt. And if there's material left over from the experiment, I can eat it,"" she says. Evolving community Patterson is just one of dozens of citizen scientists setting up their own gene laboratories in the hope of inventing new and useful organisms. A community is evolving to take advantage of low-cost, off-the-shelf genetic parts and increasing knowledge in biological engineering. International competitions such as the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) and io9 Mad Science contest have already produced a number of stars, with practical innovations in medicine, agriculture and biocomputing. However, Helen Wallace of GeneWatch in the UK thinks biohacking could be dangerous. ""It is increasingly easy to order genes by mail,"" she says. ""Something like smallpox is hard to get, but there are other organisms that could become harmful. If you change a living organism's properties, you could also change its interactions with the environment or the human body."" She adds: ""Scientists are notorious for not seeing the unintended consequences."" Reshma Shetty is part of the team behind Ginkgo Bioworks, a Massachusetts-based company aiming to make DIY biotechnology a reality. She says: ""Nowadays, biotechnology is like a medieval guild. Firstly, you have to get a PhD, but if you want to practise you then need venture capital, otherwise you don't have the tools."" Ginkgo aims to make the process easier by offering off-the-shelf biological components and a third-party service for rapid prototyping. ""This will take power away from patent owners like Monsanto and pave the way for more people to have a positive impact,"" she says. Ginkgo has already constructed GMOs that release the odour of bananas, turn red or glow in the dark, and is developing a host of new organisms that will all be in the public domain. ""They're not harmful pathogens,"" she says. ""Complex organisms make use of the same components to do all this incredible stuff without any harmful chemicals … In 10 years, all sorts of new stuff will have been done."" Jim Thomas, of the environmental thinktank ETC Group, says: ""The risk is we have limited knowledge of how these things work. GM crops have out-crossed [bred with non-GM plants] after we were told they wouldn't. GM bacteria for transforming crops into biofuels have been shown to damage soil. Where is the oversight?"" MacKenzie Cowell is a founding member of Boston-based DIYbio, which provides tools and advice to biohackers. In May they will co-ordinate the first ""Flash Lab"", sending out 1,000 volunteers to take swabs from pedestrian crossing buttons around Boston. The data will be analysed to produce a BioWeatherMap of bacteria roaming the city. Outbreak ""We think we'll pick up all sorts of surprising stuff,"" says Cowell. ""I was sick for three days with the symptoms of salmonella last year, before finding out there had been an outbreak in New York where I was staying."" This inspired him to start the project, which has been nicknamed ""Google Flu"". ""We hope to get out and do these once a month,"" he says, ""but it could happen far more frequently."" Benefits may come from increased access and transparency in science, but sometimes the authorities have difficulty recognising it. In 2004, the art professor Steve Kurtz was arrested as a suspected bioterrorist because Petri dishes with bacteria in them were found at his home in New York state, after his wife had died of a heart attack. Last year Victor Deeb, a retired chemist, had his basement laboratory taken apart by US environmental officials after a fire in the apartment upstairs. He was trying to make safe surface coatings for food containers using chemicals less hazardous than those found in household cleaners. In Britain, regulations are far stricter. Chris French, a lecturer at Edinburgh University and local biological safety officer, says: ""There's very little that can be done at a home address … GMOs are very strictly regulated by the Health and Safety Executive – and for sound reasons. Working with living things which can potentially escape and grow offers potential hazards."" Surgical tasks This hasn't stopped UK university teams from developing a host of useful biological innovations over the last few years. One of the winners of last year's iGEM competition was Bristol University's Bacto-Builders project, using teams of E. coli bacteria to perform surgical tasks that single organisms would find impossible. Its project is moving forward in collaboration with the TiGEM genetics laboratory in Italy. ""We are in the nascent stages of some kind of DIY biotechnology network in the UK,"" says Kim de Mora, a biology PhD student at Edinburgh University.

""Three years ago, we realised we were spending over half our income on chemicals. It was too much. We were getting into debt and the pesticides were making us ill."" Sattemma is in the village of Lakshminayak Thanda in Warangal district of Andhra Pradesh. The visitors are keen to know how she and other villagers are progressing after their decision to stop using pesticides and Bt cotton, the genetically modified variety manufactured by US biotechnology firm Monsanto. Bt cotton was engineered to combat pests, with the introduction into the cotton seed of a gene from a soil bacterium called Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which has a natural insect-killing poison called Bt-toxin. When it was introduced into India at the turn of the century, it was promoted as the ""wonder product"" that would solve the serious problem of pests, which many of India's 17 million cotton farmers were facing. Many of the farmers had not been growing cotton as a cash crop for very long. In the late 1980s, under pressure from the International Monetary Fund, India had opened up its strongly protected economy and encouraged its farmers to switch to modern farming, with its hybrid seeds, fertilisers and pesticides. The idea was to turn India into an important exporter of commodities, including cotton. At first, cotton farmers did well. They got high yields and enjoyed a real increase in income. But then problems arose. The hybrid cotton proved susceptible to pests and diseases, and it was not uncommon for farmers to spray their fields up to 30 times in a single season. Production costs went through the roof and farmers got trapped in debt. They became desperate for a technical fix, and Bt cotton seemed to be the answer. In its first year of sales, Mahyco-Monsanto sold its entire stock of Bt cotton. According to the company, the area in India under Bt cotton rose from 3.1m acres in 2005 to 14.4m acres in 2007. According to Sekhar Natarajan, regional leader of Monsanto India, Bt cotton yielded 700kg-900kg per acre, compared with 300kg-400kg an acre with conventional seeds. However, some say that what has been happening on the ground has been very different from the official success story. Scientists Abdul Qayum and Kiran Sakhari assessed Bt cotton's performance in the first three years and found that, despite claims by the company, farmers were not achieving big yields. This perhaps was to be expected, because Bt cotton had been engineered to reduce pesticide use, not to increase yields. But, more surprisingly, they found that pesticide use was not falling either, because farmers were facing serious problems with secondary pests. They worked out that, on average, the income of non-Bt farmers was 60% higher than that of Bt farmers. Monsanto contests these numbers. There have been other, more alarming problems. In her chat with the visiting farmers, Sattemma says she had seen several of her neighbour's goats die after spending all day grazing on post-harvest Bt cotton plants. Such a story could be dismissed as anecdotal, if it were not backed up by more solid evidence. In 2006, more than 1,800 sheep died in similar circumstances in other villages in Warangal district. The symptoms and post-mortem findings suggested that they had died from severe toxicity. Hundreds of agricultural workers had also developed allergic symptoms when exposed to Bt cotton. Safety investigation One might have expected such reports to have led to a thorough investigation into the safety of Bt cotton but, according to the US-based Institute for Responsible Technology, this has never happened. Again, Monsanto contests this account. According to Natarajan, Bt cotton was exhaustively tested for six to eight years before it was authorised for release and there were no reports of adverse impacts on the health of humans or animals. Less controversial is the financial risk that Bt cotton, along with other hybrids, brings to small farmers. Farmers have traditionally saved seeds from one harvest to another, but this is not possible with hybrids, as they lose vitality. So farmers purchase on credit from middlemen a package of hybrid seed, fertiliser and pesticide, paying back the loan once the crop is harvested. The problems start when a farmer loses a crop through bad weather. Unable to repay, they can easily get caught in a debt trap. Problems were serious before Bt cotton but have got worse because Bt cotton seed is expensive. Despite these problems, the Indian government believes that cotton has proved a success. In 2006, India overtook the US to become the world's second largest cotton producer (after China). The biotechnology industry is taking the credit, though some farmers are reporting new problems, saying Bt cotton is highly susceptible to wilt. On one occasion a Mahyco-Monsanto representative was taken hostage by irate farmers demanding compensation. More difficulties could lie ahead: a recent study by the Nagpur-based Central Institute for Cotton Research showed that the main cotton pest, bollworms, is becoming resistant to Bt cotton. Many farmers, like Sattemma, have not followed the debate around Bt cotton. She says it was practical considerations that led to the change in farming. ""It was the 15 women in our village's self-help group who got things going,"" she says. ""We were worried about the health of our children. We got the men on our side by showing them that they would save money."" Sattemma points to a chart on the wall of a nearby house, on which, with the help of a non-governmental organisation, they have recorded side-by-side the expenses of growing cotton with and without pesticides. Non-pesticide management (NPM), as the system is called, is clearly more profitable, not because yields are higher but because expenditure is so much lower. In Yenabavi, about 30 miles away, the farmers have gone further, becoming organic and declaring their village GMO-free. Their conversion also began with dissatisfaction with pesticides, this time because they didn't work. ""Ten years ago, this field was covered with red-headed hairy caterpillars,"" says Malliah, the farmer who has led the change. ""I kept applying more pesticides but I couldn't get rid of them."" By chance, an organic agronomist was visiting. He showed Malliah how to set up solar-powered light traps and, to Malliah's delight, they worked. Since then, he and the other farmers have developed other natural pest controls. Other villages are following suit. Almost 2,000 in Andhra Pradesh have adopted NPM. Raghuveera Reddy, the state's minister for agriculture wants 2.5m acres under community-managed sustainable agriculture within a few years. The long-term goal is for 10m acres, 45% of the state's cultivable land. Sustainable agriculture involves hard work and does not guarantee huge profits, but it will not harm the farmers' health, brings personal satisfaction, and involves fewer financial risks. It is crucial to remember what is truly sustainable for small farmers.",,0.0625900474929601

The door was left open, on the basis that it would be unwise to rule out GM crops for the future, but as the charity Practical Action commented, ""the report rightly concludes that small-scale farmers and ecological methods provide the way forward to avert the current food crisis"". It's time many science policy-makers started eating GM humble pie, and urgent questions must now be raised about the lessons they have drawn from the GMO debate. With the exception of John Battle, every UK science minister and chief scientist since Labour came to power, together with media-friendly scientists and policy wonks, have assumed that the public ""misunderstood the facts"" in rejecting the current generation of GM crops. But in virtually every deliberative process undertaken the jury said no to GM crops. Together with Andy Stirling, from the science policy research unit at the University of Sussex, I was involved in the first citizens' jury to discuss GM crops exactly 10 years ago. Its 1998 report concurs with the 2008 IAASTD findings. We've had 10 years and, I suspect, tens of millions of pounds, promoting transgenic crops as a solution for world hunger and sustainable agriculture - in the face of the balance of scientific evidence. Some within government, though not the research councils, are still using the GMO debate, alongside the MMR controversy, in support of attempts to send us back to the dark age of the deficit model. The irrationality of this model, contrasting officially approved experts with mere lay people, is now beyond argument. Completely preposterous arguments, such as those used to defend deficit thinking or that GM crops will feed the world, require unflinching faith. The previous chief scientist, Sir David King, seemed to think that most problems related to public trust in science could be solved by the application of the deficit model and his ethical code. The funding councils are not without their deficit fans. They've even been known to support deficit fringe groups such as Sense About Science. Thankfully, wiser heads at the councils decided to set up the six Beacons for Public Engagement. Together, we have four years to show that researchers at universities can welcome those whose expertise comes from experience as co-producers of useful knowledge.

But this process, which involves the natural exchange of thousands of genes in each crossing, is very slow and can only occur within a single species. Genetic engineering allows this process to be accelerated by adding genetic material, very often from another species, directly into an organism's genome. A range of techniques are used to do this, which together are called recombinant DNA technology. The first genetically modified organism (GMO), an E coli bug containing a salmonella gene, was created in 1973. GM technology is used to introduce pest, disease or herbicide resistance into crops or to make them better suited to harsh environments. The most common modifications seen in plants are those that make them tolerant to the herbicide glyphosate or ones that contain Bt toxin, an insecticide. A wide range of plants have been modified, including cotton, oilseed rape and tobacco. Other modifications are used to increase the shelf life or food value of a plant. For instance, ""golden rice"" has additional betacarotene content, which the body needs to manufacture vitamin A. Researchers are currently developing GM bananas that would include a dose of hepatitis B vaccine, meaning that people in developing countries could be vaccinated without needles or the need for cold storage of vaccines. The use of GMOs has been highly controversial. Concerns centre around four areas: ethical opposition to GM technology on principle, because it is seen as ""playing God""; concern that there may be adverse, long-term consequences to environmental or human health; worries that GM technology rests in the hands of a few multinational companies; and, finally, issues of equity, with the cost of modified crops being beyond the reach of those who most need them. This latter concern has been heightened by the industrial development of a technology called Terminator. Yet to be commercialised, this technology effectively allows the production of GM crops that only yield sterile seed, thereby forcing the farmer to return to the company to buy more seed. Labelling and proper separation of GM and non GM foods is a further difficulty. In medicine, genetically modified bacteria are used to produce insulin. GMOs produce a wide range of pharmaceutical products, such as enzymes, hormones and vaccines, and GM is a basic tool in biological research. Transgenic animals, principally mice, are used to study responses to disease. Gene therapy Gene therapy uses genetically modified viruses to treat human disease. Viruses operate by inserting their own genetic material into that of their host. In gene therapy, this process is hijacked. Viruses, typically ones called adenoviruses, retroviruses or herpes simplex viruses are modified to carry the corrected gene of a faulty human one. Target cells, such as a patient's liver or lungs, are infected by the virus, which then unloads its genetic material (carrying the altered human gene) into the target cells. The cells that carry the altered genes then work normally. The first recipient of gene therapy was a four-year-old girl, Ashanthi DeSilva, who had a rare immune disorder called SCID - known as the ""bubble boy disease"". Although this therapy was successful, the subsequent history of gene therapy has been fraught with difficulty and controversy. Gene therapy came to a virtual halt in 1999, following the death of 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger, who had a severe immune response to the virus carrier (the vector). In 2003, two of 10 children treated with gene therapy for SCID with a retrovirus vector developed a leukaemia-like condition. Despite initial excitement, this technique has not yet delivered the goods. There are many problems, including trouble with the vectors themselves, the response of the recipient's immune system and the short-lived nature of the treatment, which means patients have to undergo multiple treatments. But there have been successes. Recently doctors at Moorfields Eye Hospital were able to treat a type of inherited childhood blindness caused by a single abnormal gene, restoring vision. A totally new approach involves zinc finger proteins, which are proteins that bind with DNA. They can carry the DNA equivalent of scissors, which gives them the potential to detect and alter individual gene mutations.",,0.0937377745711079

Now a real expert, Robert Watson, the chief scientist at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, who was chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has firmly rebuked Thatcher's former chancellor in a statement that only mildly reflects his growing exasperation. Watson says that Lawson selectively quotes UN science findings; that there is no doubt that future warming is inevitable, and that inaction will lead to further destruction of the world's natural resources, land, water and biodiversity. In other words, Lord Lawson, you are wrong, please shut up!

Rumours abound that the French government made a secret deal with the greens; in return for acceptance of nuclear power, the government would capitulate on GM crops. A panel composed of distinguished French scientists and representatives of consumers, environmentalists, farmers and industry, was asked last autumn to re-evaluate the risks and benefits of MON810 corn for the environment and human health. This maize makes a protein to restrict losses to corn earworm and to reduce chemical insecticide applications. Unfortunately for the government and its alleged deal, the panel report noted the MON810 corn shows reduced mycotoxin levels (good for consumers) and only pointed out that some new data had emerged since 1998, and that toxicology, ecotoxicology and economic impact should continue to be monitored. No matter; the chairman in oral testimony misrepresented the written report - referring, for example, to ""serious doubts"", though such language was absent from the report - and the French government decided to continue restricting a yield-increasing, health-promoting, environmentally beneficial technology, that French maize farmers want to use, and that Spanish maize farmers plant on many thousands of hectares. Result; outrage from most of the scientists on the panel at this triumph of politics over data and a renewed call from leading French scientists for rational appraisal of this extraordinarily promising approach to crop improvement. There's also been a puzzling apparent decline in enthusiasm from two of the three major European agricultural biotechnology companies - Syngenta and Bayer - for GM crops in Europe. However, their reason is simple; Monsanto has become the Microsoft of the GMO industry, while European agricultural biotechnology companies are held back by delays in EU approval of GM crops at home. Monsanto has been much more successful than any of its competitors at creating genes that improve crop performance. More recently, it is also outperforming them at maize and soybean breeding. So, if GM crops open up in Europe, Monsanto makes a lot more money. Big European agricultural chemical companies make most of their money selling crop control chemicals. Why would they want disease or pest control to be achieved by crop improvement in Europe if the result is loss of a market for their chemical products and if the crops are improved by Monsanto? So, let's all just try to ignore the extra unnecessary tractor trips and CO2 emissions from avoidable agrichemical applications; after all, we're holding the line against American multinationals. Monsanto's commercial dominance is extraordinary, but the solution is not protectionism in Europe. It is competition from Europe. The challenge to Microsoft did not come from IBM or Dell; it came from impudent, disrespectful start-ups like Sun, Apple, Yahoo and Google. So where could the competition to Monsanto come from? Not Syngenta, Bayer and BASF, if the past is a guide to future performance. Europe has many young and creative plant scientists - the Belgian company PGS (now bought by Bayer) was founded by such people - but researchers are currently disillusioned by European overregulation and the utterly misguided hostility of the European greens towards modern crop improvement. The big agricultural chemical companies are all in favour of tight regulation in Europe, even if it's not in the public interest. If it keeps Monsanto out too, so much the better for some of them (though not BASF, which has an alliance with Monsanto). Even Monsanto likes regulation, though not if it means they can't sell their seeds. Strangest of all, Monsanto has inadvertent, well-meaning and very effective allies to crush challenges to its dominance, in the form of Greenpeace, the Soil Association, the organic movement and the European Union's labyrinthine GM crop regulations. Monsanto has always been very enthusiastic about regulation, crop monitoring, and anything else that ties the competition up in knots, and prices them out of the market. Say what you like about Monsanto, these people are not stupid. So, it's weird. Agricultural chemical goliaths conspire with Greenpeace to keep Monsanto out of Europe, and Monsanto conspires with Greenpeace to keep down competition from small companies and the public sector. Strange bedfellows; it would be amusing, if the consequences were not so damaging. The EU often huffs and puffs about its aspirations to lead the world in the ""knowledge-based bioeconomy"", while at the same time suffocating the capacity to bring to market foods and crops improved by biotechnology. If the EU is serious about exercising leadership, here is what it should do. First, it should completely deregulate any GM crop engineered only with plant genes, and simply treat these GM crops on the same basis as any other new plant variety. Second, it should dramatically speed up the assessment of other GM crops, so that we can all benefit quickly from increased crop yield, improved efficiency of nitrogen or water usage, improved insect and nematode resistance, and improved food quality. Third, it should cease and desist from preventing European farmers and consumers from benefiting from technology that is dramatically improving the productivity, safety and standard of living of other farmers throughout the rest of the world. We should aim to exceed the US in deregulation, and thus help the developing world. This would be real leadership, and would stimulate a host of EU start-ups in agricultural biotechnology. The UK should push for this; if the notoriously inert EU remains unmoved, then (at the risk of sounding like a convert to UKIP), we should go it alone. Food prices have doubled in the last year, due to a combination of drought, increased planting for biofuels and increased demand from China. We no longer have the luxury of spurning technology that dramatically increases yield and reduces the environmental impact of agriculture. We also cannot afford to squelch creativity and entrepreneurship that will raise food abundance and quality. Many of us may regret that Monsanto has such dominance. The solution is not protectionism, or excessive regulation, but to free up Europe's scientists and entrepreneurs to compete. And not with one arm tied behind their backs.",,0.07551591222786876

Now, Schmeiser, of Bruno, Saskatchewan, is back to launch another slingshot at Monsanto, and this time he is suing the billion dollar business for £300 in his local small claims court. At stake, he says, is millions of pounds of compensation for those who have seen their land contaminated with GM material, and the rights of organic farmers and others to produce GM-free crops. Monsanto calls the case ""specific and local"". Schmeiser and his wife, Louise, are suing for the C$600 (£300) it cost to hire contractors to dig up several of Monsanto's GM oilseed rape plants he found growing in a field he was preparing for a mustard crop in 2005. Schmeiser argues the stray plants are pollution, and the polluter should pay. The company refused unless he agreed not to talk about it. Schmeiser said: ""No corporation should have the right to introduce GM seeds or plants into the environment and not be responsible for it. It doesn't matter if it was $600, or $600,000. It has now become a very important case, even though it is small, because if we win then it could cost Monsanto millions and millions of dollars across the world.""

""It was almost unbelievable that Monsanto didn't pay, because it came out and admitted it was their GMO [genetically modified organism] on our property,"" he said. ""But they said they would refuse to pay unless we signed a non-disclosure statement. No way would we ever give that away to a corporation."" The case was due to be heard in Saskatchewan tomorrow, but Monsanto said it will be delayed at Schmeiser's request. Schmeiser said he had not requested a delay. He said: ""If Monsanto had come and removed the plants, it would have been over. We didn't want another case, but we have to stand up to them again. As long as we have the strength to continue, we will fight for the rights of farmers."" A spokesperson for Monsanto said: ""Mr Schmeiser approached Monsanto about this in 2005. Monsanto has a general policy in Canada to assist in such matters if and when they arise with growers. However, Mr Schmeiser refused our offer to assist and decided to pursue this small claim through the courts.""",,0.040032467532467544
